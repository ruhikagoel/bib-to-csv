Abstract = {Support for strong electronic mail security is widely available yet only
   few communicants appear to make use of these features. Apparently, the
   operational overhead of security outweighs its perceived benefits.
   Towards increasing the benefits versus overhead ratio we follow an
   approach that considers security and usability tradeoffs from the
   outset. We separate key exchange from binding keys to identities. The
   best effort key exchange and key maintenance scheme that we devise
   operates transparently for the user. We also describe complementary
   visualization and interaction techniques that communicate the security
   state of sent and received mail to users in a non-intrusive fashion.
   Structured interviews were conducted with 19 users to assess the
   usability of the metaphors and the complementary visualizations of the
   security state. Towards a practical assessment of the overheads of
   binding keys to identities, we conducted a quantitative analysis of 17
   users' anonymized mailbox extracts to determine which security
   mechanisms would be most appropriate for their communication patterns.
   We argue that for individual non-commercial users, out-of-band
   verification of keys could be more economical than building trust in
   public key certificates issued by third parties. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {The adoption of Information and Communication Technologies in personal,
   social and corporative environments is increasingly evident, bringing
   complexity, interdisciplinarity and diversity to the study on
   information security in an era marked by decentralization and ubiquity.
   As this phenomenon becomes increasingly common, concerns intensify
   regarding security, secrecy, privacy, and information governance.
   Consequently, secure tools have gained more evidence and new solutions
   are emerging. However, literature shows the difficulty of adopting these
   secure solutions, even though they are efficient for information
   security, reinforcing the need for more effective security and privacy
   models on the Web to increase their adoption by users in general. Thus,
   it is necessary that the approaches to the development of security and
   privacy solutions be understood by the users, facilitating their
   adoption, without disregarding their contexts of use. Therefore, a
   review of such solutions seems necessary. In this article, we
   instantiate the usable security field for secure email and presented a
   review of the main tools, seeking to understand the implemented task
   model of each tool. With an analytical evaluation, we verified the
   compliance of these solutions with the usable security guidelines
   existing in the literature. Finally, we contribute to the usable
   security field by indicating in which directions secure email tools
   might be developed to accommodate the usable security guidelines.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Volume = {8},
Pages = {130066-130081},
Abstract = {With hundred billions of emails sent daily, the adoption of contemporary
   email security standards and best practices by the respective providers
   are of utmost importance to everyone of us. Leaving out the
   user-dependent measures, say, S/MIME and PGP, this work concentrates on
   the current security standards adopted in practice by providers to
   safeguard the communications among their SMTP servers. To this end, we
   developed a non-intrusive tool coined MECSA, which is publicly available
   as a web application service to anyone who wishes to instantly assess
   the security status of their email provider regarding both the inbound
   and outbound communication channels. By capitalising on the data
   collected by MECSA over a period of 15 months, that is, approximate to
   7,650 assessments, analysing a total of 3,236 unique email providers, we
   detail on the adoption rate of state-of-the-art email security
   extensions, including STARTTLS, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and MTA-STS. Our
   results indicate a clear increase in encrypted connections and in the
   use of SPF, but also considerable retardation in the penetration rate of
   the rest of the standards. This tardiness is further aggravated by the
   still low prevalence of DNSSEC, which is also appraised for the email
   security space in the context of this work.},

Abstract = {Several end-to-end encryption technologies for emails such as PGP and
   S/MIME exist since decades. However, end-to-end encryption is barely
   applied. To understand why users hesitate to secure their email
   communication and which usability issues they face with PGP, S/MIME as
   well as with pEp (Pretty Easy Privacy), a fairly new technology, we
   conducted an online survey and user testing. We found that more than
   60\% of e-mail users are unaware of the existence of such encryption
   technologies and never tried to use one. We observed that above all,
   users are overwhelmed with the management of public keys and struggle
   with the setup of encryption technology in their mail software. Even
   though users struggle to put email encryption into practice, we
   experienced roughly the same number of users being aware of the
   importance of email encryption. Particularly, we found that users are
   very concerned about identity theft, as 78\% want to make sure that no
   other person is able to write email in their name.},

Abstract = {WWW-based user interface is presented for secure electronic mail service
   for healthcare users. Using this method, communications between an
   electronic mail (WWW) server and users (WWW browsers) can be performed
   securely using Secure Socket Layer protocol-based Hypertext Transfer
   Protocol (SSL-HTTP). The mail can be encrypted, signed, and sent to the
   recipients and vice versa on the remote WWW server. The merit of this
   method is that many healthcare users can use a secure electronic mail
   system easily and immediately, because SSL-compatible WWW browsers are
   widely used and this system can be made available simply by installing a
   WWW-based mail user agent on a mail server. We implemented a WWW-based
   mail user agent which is compatible with PEM-based secure mail and made
   it available to about 16,000 healthcare users. We believe this approach
   is effective in facilitating secure network-based information exchange

Abstract = {With billions of emails exchanged worldwide on a daily basis, email is
   nowadays considered to be one of the most widespread forms of digital
   communications. The massive deployment of this technology is certainly
   due to its ease of use and interoperability. This advantageous ubiquity
   of email communications comes nonetheless at the cost of security, which
   is often side-lined in favour of maintaining backwards compatibility
   with older versions of the protocols and considering security features
   as optional to ensure compatibility between providers. As a consequence,
   email communications often fall short of protecting the privacy and the
   authenticity of the information exchanged. Taking into account the fact
   that email is used to exchange private and personal information, the
   latter risks become extremely prominent. We review here the outstanding
   privacy and security risks in worldwide email communications and we
   describe a set of practical countermeasures, based on combinations of
   existing standards, which are capable of effectively mitigating the
   identified risks. Based on this analysis we provide a set of technical
   recommendations to be followed by email providers in order to enhance
   security, whilst preserving compatibility in the ecosystem.},

   near-nonexistent. Is this simply due to a failure to apply standard user
   interface design techniques to security? We argue that, on the contrary,
   effective security requires a different usability standard, and that it
   will not be achieved through the user interface design techniques
   appropriate to other types of consumer software.
   To test this hypothesis, we performed a case study of a security program
   which does have a good user interface by general standards: PGP 5.0. Our
   case study used a cognitive walkthrough analysis together with a
   laboratory user test to evaluate whether PGP 5.0 can be successfully
   used by cryptopraphy novices to achieve effective electronic mail
   security. The analysis found a number of user interface design flaws
   that may contribute to security failures, and the user test demonstrated
   that when our test participants were given 90 minutes in which to sign
   and encrypt a message using PGP 5.0, the majority of them were unable to
   do so successfully.
   We conclude that PGP 5.0 is not usable enough to provide effective
   security for most computer users, despite its attractive graphical user
   interface, supporting our hypothesis that user interface design for
   effective security remains an open problem. We close with a brief
   description of our continuing work on the development and application of
   user interface design principles and techniques for security.},

Abstract = {Improving the usability and adoption of secure (i.e. end-to-end
   encrypted) email systems has been a notorious challenge for over two
   decades. One of the open questions concerns the amount and format of
   information that should be communicated to users to inform them of the
   security and privacy properties with respect to different messages or
   correspondents. Contributing to the ongoing discussion on the usability
   and effectiveness of security and privacy indicators, particularly in
   the context of systems targeting non-expert users, this paper sheds
   light on users' evaluation of traffic light-inspired indicators, as a
   metaphor to represent different privacy states and guarantees, provided
   by a new system for email end-to-end encryption called p=p. Using a
   mixed-methods approach, based on input gathered from 150 participants in
   three online studies, we highlight the pros and cons of the traffic
   light semantic in p=p's context and beyond, and discuss the potential
   implications on the perceived security and use of such systems.},

Abstract = {Email plays an important role in the digital economy but is threatened
   by increasingly sophisticated cybercrimes. A number of security services
   have been developed, including an email authentication service designed
   to cope with email threats. It remains unknown how users perceive and
   evaluate these security services and consequently form their adoption
   intention. Drawing on the Technology Acceptance Model and Technology
   Threat Avoidance Theory, this paper investigates the factors that affect
   user intention to adopt an email authentication service. Our results
   show that user intention to adopt an email security service is
   contingent upon users' perception of risk and evaluation of both
   internal and external coping strategies. This study contributes to
   research in security service adoption, service success and design, and
   information security behaviour.},

Abstract = {The email system is a globally distributed communication infrastructure
   service that involves multiple actors playing different roles to ensure
   end-to-end mail delivery. It is an indispensable method of communicating
   that is changing how people share data and information. As a result, it
   facilitates effective and efficient communication, especially in
   business, as well as convenience, accessibility, and replication. Today,
   email can send more than just text files; it can also send audio, video,
   photos, and other files with extensions. With email becoming ubiquitous
   in all aspects of our lives, enhancing its security, operating
   procedures, and forensic investigation has become essential. The purpose
   of this paper is to review some real email forensic incidents and the
   tools and techniques that have been proposed. A discussion of the major
   threats to email as well as techniques to mitigate them will also be
   provided. A comparison study was made of several techniques and analysis
   tools used in email forensics. In addition, this paper compares the
   available software tools for email forensics based on factors such as
   language interface, user interface, programming language, creation of
   image files, calculation of hash value, cost, and advantages.},

Abstract = {Encryption is used to convert an email message to an unreadable format
   thereby securing patient privacy during the transmission of the message
   across the Internet. Two available means of encryption are: public key
   infrastructure (PKI) used in conjunction with ordinary email and secure
   hypertext transfer protocol (HTTPS) used by secure web-mail
   applications. Both of these approaches have advantages and disadvantages
   in terms of viability, cost, usability and compliance. The aim of this
   study was develop an instrument to identify the most appropriate means
   of encrypting email communication for telemedicine. A multi-method
   approach was used to construct the instrument. Technical assessment and
   existing bodies of knowledge regarding the utility of PKI were analyzed,
   along with survey results from users of Queensland Health's Child and
   Youth Mental Health Service secure web-mail service. The resultant
   decision support model identified that the following conditions affect
   the choice of encryption technology: correspondent's risk perception,
   correspondent's identification to the security afforded by encryption,
   email-client used by correspondents, the tolerance to human error and
   the availability of technical resources. A decision support model is
   presented as a flow chart to identify the most appropriate encryption
   for a specific email-based telemedicine service.},

Abstract = {Secure email is increasingly being touted as usable by novice users,
   with a push for adoption based on recent concerns about government
   surveillance. To determine whether secure email is ready for grassroots
   adoption, we employ a laboratory user study that recruits pairs of
   novice users to install and use several of the latest systems to
   exchange secure messages. We present both quantitative and qualitative
   results from 25 pairs of novice users as they use Pwm, Tutanota, and
   Virtru. Participants report being more at ease with this type of study
   and better able to cope with mistakes since both participants are ``on
   the same page{''}. We find that users prefer integrated solutions over
   depot-based solutions, and that tutorials are important in helping
   first-time users. Hiding the details of how a secure email system
   provides security can lead to a lack of trust in the system.
   Participants expressed a desire to use secure email, but few wanted to
   use it regularly and most were unsure of when they might use it.},

   Security Tool},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {User adoption and usage of end-to-end encryption tools is an ongoing
   research topic. A subset of such tools allows users to encrypt
   confidential emails, as well as manage their access control using
   features such as the expiration time, disabling forwarding, persistent
   protection, and watermarking. Previous studies have suggested that
   protective attitudes and behaviors could improve the adoption of new
   security technologies. Therefore, we conducted a user study on 19
   participants to understand their perceptions of an email security tool
   and how they use it to manage access control to confidential information
   such as medical, tax, and employee information if sent via email. Our
   results showed that the participants' first impression upon receiving an
   end-to-end encrypted email was that it looked suspicious, especially
   when received from an unknown person. After the participants were
   informed about the importance of the investigated tool, they were
   comfortable sharing medical, tax, and employee information via this
   tool. Regarding access control management of the three types of
   confidential information, the expiration time and disabling forwarding
   were most useful for the participants in preventing unauthorized and
   continued access. While the participants did not understand how the
   persistent protection feature worked, many still chose to use it,
   assuming it provided some extra layer of protection to confidential
   information and prevented unauthorized access. Watermarking was the
   least useful feature for the participants, as many were unsure of its
   usage. Our participants were concerned about data leaks from recipients'
   devices if they set a longer expiration date, such as a year. We provide
   the practical implications of our findings.},

Abstract = {Researchers have investigated the usability challenges of end-toend
   encryption for electronic mail while users seem to place little value
   into the confidentiality of their mail. On the other hand, users should
   see value in protection against phishing. Designing mail apps so that
   they help users resist phishing attacks has received less attention. A
   well-known and widely implemented mechanism can be brought to bear on
   this problem - digital signatures. We investigated contemporary mail
   apps and found that they make limited use of digital signatures to help
   users detect phishing mail. We developed and studied an opinionated user
   interface design that steers users towards safe behaviors when
   confronted with phishing mail. In our study with 18 participants we
   found that the control group was phishable whereas the experimental
   group remained safe.},

Abstract = {Recovery connections between email accounts can be exploited in manual
   hijacking attacks as has been shown in several incidents during the last
   years. Yet little is known about users' practices of chaining email
   accounts together. We conducted a qualitative interview study with 23
   students in which they shared their email recovery and forwarding
   settings with us. Altogether, we collected and analyzed information
   about 138 different email accounts. We used this data to map email
   account topologies and analyzed these topologies for recurring patterns.
   We found that users often make poor configuration decisions in their
   email recovery setups, and often create patterns in their email recovery
   topologies that result in security vulnerabilities. Patterns such as
   loops (seen in more than a quarter of our topologies) could be easily
   exploited in a targeted attack. We conclude that users need better
   guidance about how to use email based recovery settings in a robust way.},

Abstract = {Email privacy is of crucial importance. Existing email encryption
   approaches are comprehensive but seldom used due to their complexity and
   inconvenience. We take a newapproach to simplify email encryption and
   improve its usability by implementing receiver-controlled encryption:
   newly received messages are transparently downloaded and encrypted to a
   locally-generated key; the original message is then replaced. To avoid
   the problem of moving a single private key between devices, we implement
   per-device key pairs: only public keys need be synchronized via a simple
   verification step. Compromising an email account or server only provides
   access to encrypted emails. We implemented this scheme on several
   platforms, showing it works with PGP and S/MIME, is compatible with
   widely used mail clients and email services including Gmail, has
   acceptable overhead, and that users consider it intuitive and easy to
   use.},

Abstract = {We propose a concept called TORPEDO to improve phish detection by
   providing just-in-time and just-in-place trustworthy tooltips. These
   help people to identify phish links embedded in emails. TORPEDO's
   tooltips contain the actual URL with the domain highlighted. Link
   activation is delayed for a short period, giving the person time to
   inspect the URL before they click on a link. Furthermore, TORPEDO
   provides an information diagram to explain phish detection. We evaluated
   TORPEDO's effectiveness, as compared to the worst case ``status bar{''}
   as provided by other Web email interfaces. People using TORPEDO
   performed significantly better in detecting phishes and identifying
   legitimate emails (85.17\% versus 43.31\% correct answers for phish). We
   then carried out a field study with a number of TORPEDO users to explore
   actual user experiences of TORPEDO. We conclude the paper by reporting
   on the outcome of this field study and suggest improvements based on the
   feedback from the field study participants. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Electronic mail (email) systems have grown in complexity to the point
   where their reliability and usability are coming into question. The
   authors of individual email components are widely distributed in both
   time and space, bound together only by message structure and transfer
   protocol specifications; consequently filters, autoresponders, and
   various security features may interact in unanticipated and, often,
   incomprehensible ways. In this paper, I use a modular, abstract
   formalism to model and compose email feature specifications. I then
   search for feature interactions using a systematic methodology based in
   part on human intuition and in part on simulation and formal test
   coverage, to analyze pairs of ten common email features. I list the? 26
   interactions found in this way and discuss the usefulness of the
   technique.},

Abstract = {Electronic mail, as one of the most widely used identifiers, is
   extensively utilized for account registration and recovery, two-factor
   authentication, and organizational identification. Traditional email
   ownership authentication is typically achieved through verification
   codes or links sent via email, which leads to full disclosure of a
   user's email address.
   We propose FreeAuth, an innovative and universal email ownership
   authentication scheme that enhances privacy by allowing users to
   selectively disclose email-related information. FreeAuth distinguishes
   itself from precedents by eschewing verification emails, thus avoiding
   spam marking and online behavior tracking. It establishes an
   authentication interaction paradigm based on widely deployed email
   transmission protocols, such as SMTP, IMAP, and POP3, ensuring legacy
   compatibility and server obliviousness. Meanwhile, it utilizes TLS
   Oracle schemes to protect data privacy by disclosing only the
   authentication outcome of the interaction, rather than revealing the
   full email address. FreeAuth can be integrated as an alternative to
   traditional email ownership authentication schemes.
   We present details of FreeAuth architecture and instantiations of
   prototype systems, along with three tailored examples of selective email
   address disclosures to align with various scenario requirements. The
   experimental analysis indicates that FreeAuth is compatible with up to
   96\% of existing email providers, and it is notably efficient, requiring
   only 2.5 seconds of online time to complete ownership authentication in
   our wide area network settings.},

Title = {A Novel Hybrid Textual-Graphical Authentication Scheme With Better
   Security, Memorability, and Usability},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {51294-51312},
Abstract = {Despite numerous efforts, developing an authentication scheme that
   offers strong security while offering memorability and usability remains
   a grand challenge. In this paper, we propose a textual-graphical hybrid
   authentication scheme that improves the security, memorability and
   usability inadequacies of existing authentication schemes. This has been
   achieved by combining a range of mechanisms together, in a novel manner,
   to address weaknesses of the existing security schemes. Firstly, two
   dynamically selectable modes of password entry (Easy Login, and Secure
   Login) provide a trade-off between usability and security, allowing the
   user to dynamically switch to any of these methods in real-time based on
   the security of the surrounding environment (e.g., secure home
   environment versus insecure public places) or the criticality of the
   user account (e.g., a bank account). The other mechanisms included a
   novel use of the drawmetric mechanism for setting the password to
   improve memorability, multistep authentication, a novel adaptation of
   one-time password (OTP) concept using a random selection of password
   elements, random placement of password elements in different steps,
   assigning random numbers to the password elements to increase security,
   and use of simple addition to improve security. We have implemented and
   analysed the proposed scheme for its security against brute-force
   attacks, dictionary, shoulder surfing, random guessing, phishing or
   forming, keystroke/mouse logger, and multiple recording attacks. We have
   also investigated its usability and memorability, reporting various
   trends of password elements used and the respective authentication
   times. Moreover, we have compared the proposed scheme with eight other
   well-known authentication schemes in terms of its resilience and
   authentication time. The results and analyses demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed scheme. We believe that a range of novel
   methods introduced in this proposed scheme opens several doors for
   innovation in security techniques.},

Abstract = {Email worms pose a significant security threat to organizations and
   computer users today. Because they propagate over a logical network, the
   traditional epidemic model is unsuitable for modeling their propagation
   over the internet. However, it is no doubt that accurate modeling the
   propagation of email worms is helpful to contain th9eir attacks in
   advance. This paper presents a novel email worms' propagation model,
   which is based on a directed and weighted social network. Moreover, the
   effects of user's behavior are also considered in this model. To the
   author's knowledge, there is little information available considering
   the effects of them in modeling their propagation. A simulation
   algorithm is designed for verifying the effectiveness of the presented
   model. The results show that the presented model can describe the
   propagation of email worms accurately. Through simulating different
   containing strategies, we demonstrate that the infected key nodes in
   email social community can speed up the worm propagating. Last, a new
   General Susceptible Infectious Susceptible (G-SIS) email worm model is
   presented, which can predict the propagation scale of email worms
   accurately.},

Abstract = {In applications such as end-to-end encrypted instant messaging, secure
   email, and device pairing, users need to compare key fingerprints to
   detect impersonation and adversary-in-the-middle attacks. Key
   fingerprints are usually computed as truncated hashes of each party's
   view of the channel keys, encoded as an alphanumeric or numeric string,
   and compared out-of-band, e.g. manually, to detect any inconsistencies.
   Previous work has extensively studied the usability of various
   verification strategies and encoding formats, however, the exact effect
   of key fingerprint length on the security and usability of key
   fingerprint verification has not been rigorously investigated. We
   present a 162-participant study on the effect of numeric key fingerprint
   length on comparison time and error rate. While the results confirm some
   widely-held intuitions such as general comparison times and errors
   increasing significantly with length, a closer look reveals interesting
   nuances. The significant rise in comparison time only occurs when highly
   similar fingerprints are compared, and comparison time remains
   relatively constant otherwise. On errors, our results clearly
   distinguish between security non-critical errors that remain low
   irrespective of length and security critical errors that significantly
   rise, especially at higher fingerprint lengths. A noteworthy implication
   of this latter result is that Signal /WhatsApp key fingerprints provide
   a considerably lower level of security than usually assumed.},

Abstract = {Secure email is increasingly being touted as usable by novice users,
   with a push for adoption based on recent concerns about government
   surveillance. To determine whether secure email is ready for grassroots
   adoption, we employ a laboratory user study that recruits pairs of
   novice users to install and use several of the latest systems to
   exchange secure messages. We present both quantitative and qualitative
   results from 28 pairs of novices as they use Private WebMail (Pwm),
   Tutanota, and Virtru and 10 pairs of novices as they use Mailvelope.
   Participants report being more at ease with this type of study and
   better able to cope with mistakes since both participants are ``on the
   same page.{''} We find that users prefer integrated solutions over
   depot-based solutions and that tutorials are important in helping
   first-time users. Finally, our results demonstrate that Pretty Good
   Privacy using manual key management is still unusable for novice users,

Title = {Investigating the Use of Email Application in Illiterate and

Abstract = {The use of electronic communication has been significantly increased
   over the last few decades. Email is one of the most well-known means of
   electronic communication. Traditional email applications are widely used
   by a large population; however, illiterate and semi-illiterate people
   face challenges in using them. A major population of Pakistan is
   illiterate that has little or no practice of computer usage. In this
   paper, we investigate the challenges of using email applications by
   illiterate and semi-illiterate people. In addition, we also propose a
   solution by developing an application tailored to the needs of
   illiterate/semi-illiterate people. Research shows that illiterate people
   are good at learning the designs that convey information with pictures
   instead of text-only, and focus more on one object/action at a time. Our
   proposed solution is based on designing user interfaces that consist of
   icons and vocal/audio instructions instead of text. Further, we use
   background voice/audio which is more helpful than flooding a picture
   with a lot of information. We tested our application using a large
   number of users with various skill levels (from no computer knowledge to
   experts). Our results of the usability tests indicate that the
   application can be used by illiterate people without any training or
   third-party's help.},

Abstract = {As email integrates the advantages of telephone communications and
   postal mail, it has become an indispensable form of modern
   communication. Most of current network applications require an email to
   create account, making people's social characteristics and network
   identity attributes connected. It is important to monitor the user's
   behavior with different identities for security monitoring. We focus on
   extracting the user's email identity extraction and association in this
   paper. Firstly, email delivery mechanism for different email client is
   introduced with the communications protocols and related standards.
   Then, SMTP session based method and TCP stream assembly based method are
   proposed to analyze the traffic generated by email clients and web
   client respectively. All user characteristics from most email clients
   and web mail sites which has about 60 percent share in market, are
   extracted successfully. At last, the association between user's
   multi-email accounts and identity is established on some basic analysis
   of the active profile of different accounts. The analysis results with
   the actual traffic trace collect from the CERNET verify the correctness
   of the proposed method, the identification accuracy of multi-addresses
   is above 80\%, which is important for user's behavior monitoring.},

Abstract = {This work proposes an effective method of fighting spam by developing
   Inexpensive Email Addresses (TEA), a stateless system of Disposable
   Email Addresses (DEAs). TEA can cryptographically generate exclusive
   email addresses for each sender, with the ability to re-establish a new
   email address once the old one is compromised. TEA accomplishes
   proof-of-work by integrating a challenge-response mechanism to be
   completed before an email is accepted in the recipient's mail system.
   The system rejects all incoming emails and instead embeds the challenge
   inside the rejection notice of Standard Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
   error messages. The system does not create an out-of-band email for the
   challenge, thus eliminating email backscatter in comparison to other
   challenge-response email systems. The system is also effective in
   identifying spammers by exposing the exact channel, i.e. the unique
   email address that was compromised, so misuse could be traced back to
   the compromising party. Usability is of utmost concern in building such
   a system by making it friendly to the end-user and easy to setup and
   maintain by the system administrator.},

Title = {SoK: The past decade of user deception in emails and today's email
   clients' susceptibility to phishing techniques},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {150},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {User deception in emails is still one of the biggest security risks
   companies and end-users face alike. Attackers try to mislead their
   victims when assessing whether emails are dangerous to interact with,
   e.g., by using techniques based on dangerous links, dangerous
   attachments, or both. In this work, we present a systematic literature
   research of deception techniques discussed in the scientific literature
   of the last decade. We systematize the deception techniques, focusing on
   techniques that use misleading sender, link, and/or attachment
   information. We identify 23 deception techniques which we classify as
   either those that email clients should protect users against (13) and
   those that email clients cannot protect against and thus should be
   addressed insecurity awareness measures (10). We propose a security
   rating for the susceptibility of email clients to these 13 deception
   techniques and perform an empirical evaluation to analyze the
   susceptibility of seven representative email clients (web, mobile apps,
   desktop apps) to these deception techniques. The results of our
   evaluation indicate that most email clients are in need of improvement
   to defend against the deception techniques. Hardening email clients
   against these deception techniques is necessary to increase the
   resistance against them - without unnecessarily burdening users.},

Title = {User-visible cryptography in email and web scenarios},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND COMPUTER SECURITY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Pages = {58-72},
Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to classify different types of ``user-visible
   cryptography{''} and evaluate the value of user-visible cryptographic
   mechanisms in typical email and web scenarios for non-expert IT users.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors review the existing
   literature, and then identify user stories typical to their users of
   interest. They analyse the risks, mitigations of risks and the limits of
   those mitigations in the user stories.
   Findings - The scenarios identified suggest that background,
   opportunistic encryption has value, but more explicit, user-visible
   cryptographic mechanisms do not provide any further mitigation. Other
   mechanisms beyond technological mitigations provide the required
   mitigation for the users.
   Research limitations/implications - Further work should be carried out
   on the trust issues with trusted third parties, as they are intrinsic to
   global, automated cryptographic mechanisms. The authors suggest that
   deployed systems should rely on automation rather than explicit user
   involvement; further work on how best to involve users effectively
   remains valuable.
   Practical implications - Deployed systems should rely on automation
   rather than explicit user dialogues. This follows from recognised
   aspects of user behaviour, such as ignoring dialogues and unconsciously
   making a holistic assessment of risk that is mostly mitigated by social
   factors.
   Social implications - The user populations concerned rely significantly
   on the existing legal and social infrastructure to mitigate some risks,
   such as those associated with e-commerce. Guarantees from third parties
   and the existence of fallback procedures improve user confidence.
   Originality/value - This work uses user stories as a basis for a
   holistic review of the issues surrounding the use of cryptography. The
   authors concentrate on a relatively large population (non-expert IT
   users) carrying out typical tasks (web and email).},

Abstract = {The set of impressions that a user has about distinct aspects of a
   system depends on the experience perceived while interacting with the
   system. Considering the effects of these interactions in a security
   analysis allows for a new class of security properties in terms of
   misalignments between the system's technical guarantees and the user's
   impressions of them. For instance, a property that we call ``false sense
   of insecurity{''} identifies a situation in which a secure system
   injects uncertainty in users, thus improperly transmitting the degree of
   protection that it actually provides; another, which we call ``false
   sense of security{''}, captures situations in which a system instills a
   false sense of security beyond what a technical analysis would justify.
   Both situations leave room for attacks. In this paper we propose a model
   to define and reason about such socio-technical misalignments. The model
   refers to and builds on the concept of security ceremonies, but relies
   on user experience notions and on security analysis techniques to put
   together the information needed to verify misalignment properties about
   user's impressions and system's security guarantees. We discuss the
   innovative insight of this pilot model for a holistic understanding of a
   system's security. We also propose a formal model that can be used with
   existing model checkers for an automatic analysis of misalignments. We
   exemplify the approach by modelling one specific application for
   end-to-end email encryption within which we analyze a few instances of
   misalignment properties.},

   challenging and limited studies on email user behaviors. To study user
   behaviors related with phishing emails, we design and investigate an

   read emails, some of which are phishing. We used a set of emails
   including phishing emails from the real world. We collect experimental
   data including participants' basic background information, time
   measurement, and their answers to survey questions. We first check
   whether or not factors such as intervention, phishing types, and
   incentive mechanisms play a major role in user behaviors when phishing
   attacks occur. We then evaluate the significance of each attribute with
   a performance score. The performance score is a metric demonstrating how
   a user makes a correct judgment on phishing while phishing attacks
   occur. We propose a machine learning framework, which contains attribute
   reduction and 10-fold cross-validation, to predict the performance of a
   user based on our collected data.},

Abstract = {As this era is known as Electronic era where everything is associated
   with Internet and its growing number of security threats. In our study,
   we focused on three different e-mail account securities, comparatively.
   First, by performing an analysis on online E-mail service providers we
   concluded that what type of functionalities they are providing to secure
   their user's information. Second, we categorized users in to three types
   and on the basis of that we study on user's view on online security,
   confidence and usability on their E-mail service provider. Third, we
   evaluate the outcome of our study which emphasizes the user's
   precautions from protecting their accounts from unauthorized access. The
   goal is to analyze how users perceive the security of their email
   account based on the domain in which it was created. We will start by
   examining different free email providers based on their security and
   perform a comparison of their features. Then will follow a risk
   assessment of the information security system as perceived by some
   students and business users. The reality analysis will allow us to
   examine and possibly classify the email providers based on their
   security parameters and users account protection levels. A final
   comparison will then be made between the results of the reality and the
   perception analysis to put in evidence their differences and
   similarities.},

Abstract = {Due to its ease of use combined with its efficiency, traditional email
   service constitutes one of the main success story brought by the
   Internet. Its popularity hides however significant gaps. Professional
   email systems usually remedy such deficiencies by compiling a lot of
   sophisticated features in a single monolithic policy which should
   ideally take into account security requirements together with various
   other specific needs. The main drawback of these approaches lies in
   their inherent rigidity. They indeed grant no place for the concepts of
   usage and context which are fundamental for any modern communication
   service. The usage is determined by a user's intention of communication:
   private, professional, administrative, official, military... Context is
   clearly orthogonal to usage because a same usage may require different
   features depending of the context. We propose to define a correspondence
   model which for a given usage and context allows to dynamically derive a
   correspondence type encapsulating the exact set of required features.
   With this model, it becomes possible to define an advanced email system
   which may dynamically cope with multiple policies instead of a single
   monolithic one. By allowing a user to select the exact policy matching
   her needs, we argue that our approach reduces her risk-taking, providing
   in this way a confident advanced email system.},

Abstract = {Phishing is one of many computer security attacks, in which the attacker
   tries to trick people into fake website that is masqueraded to look and
   feel like the authentic website, thus prompting the victim to share
   sensitive information or install hidden malware on their computers.
   Phishing known as method which stealing personal and financial data that
   convince people to participate on unwittingly money laundering. Phishing
   link dispersing are associate with a number of methods, this paper
   focuses on e-mail message as a means to send phishing website links,
   which spoof or mimic, banks, credit card and companies or other
   e-commerce. The purpose of this research is to design and develop a tool
   to detect the source code of phishing website which attached to email by
   using decision tree algorithm. In order to improve the protection of
   users' information from the fake website. Anti-phishing detection is
   suggested to overcome the problems through the following features. The
   first feature of anti-phishing detection login system by using user's
   email and password. Second feature detect phishing website which
   attached on user's email by using decision tree algorithm. Lastly, on
   phishing website will be detected and generate a report to the user. The
   system testing shows high reliability and the users' feedback shows ease
   of use as well as learning..},

Abstract = {Secret passwords are very widely used for user authentication to
   websites, despite their known shortcomings. Most websites using
   passwords also implement password recovery to allow users to
   re-establish a shared secret if the existing value is forgotten; many
   such systems involve sending a password recovery email to the user, e.g.
   containing a secret link. The security of password recovery, and hence
   the entire user-website relationship, depends on the email being acted
   upon correctly; unfortunately, as we show, such emails are not always
   designed to maximise security and can introduce vulnerabilities into
   recovery. To understand better this serious practical security problem,
   we surveyed password recovery emails for 50 of the top English language
   websites. We investigated a range of security and usability issues for
   such emails, covering their design, structure and content (including the
   nature of the user instructions), the techniques used to recover the
   password, and variations in email content from one web service to
   another. Many well-known web services, including Facebook, Dropbox, and
   Microsoft, suffer from recovery email design, structure and content
   issues. This is, to our knowledge, the first study of its type reported
   in the literature. This study has enabled us to formulate a set of
   recommendations for the design of such emails.},

Abstract = {Electronic mail (e-mail) systems are widely used in the Internet. A user
   usually needs to send an e-mail to a group of users. In this paper, a
   secure multicast key protocol for e-mail systems with providing perfect
   forward secrecy is proposed to ensure confidentiality and authentication
   of this kind of e-mail system. The protocol employs the Chinese
   Remainder Theorem, RSA public key cryptosystems, and one-way hash
   functions. The protocol can save redundant key materials used for the
   e-mails. Via the security analysis, the protocol can satisfy the
   security requirements. In addition, we analyze the computation
   complexity of the protocol. The result showed that the protocol can save
   the computation cost for each e-mail sender. Copyright (c) 2012 John

   Historically, end-to-end encryption has been difficult for people to

   employing key-directory services. These services sacrifice some security
   properties for convenience. A 52-person user study found that
   participants could learn to understand properties of different
   encryption models and make coherent assessments about when different
   tradeoffs might be appropriate. Participants recognized that a
   less-convenient key exchange model was more secure overall, but

Abstract = {Despite all the current controversies, the success of the email service
   is still valid. The ease of use of its various features contributed to
   its widespread adoption. In general, the email system provides for all
   its users the same set of features controlled by a single monolithic
   policy. Such solutions are efficient but limited because they grant no
   place for the concept of usage which denotes a user's intention of
   communication: private, professional, administrative, official,
   military.... The ability to efficiently send emails from mobile devices
   creates new interesting opportunities. We argue that the context
   (location, time, device, operating system, access network.) of the email
   sender appears as a new dimension we have to take into account to
   complete the picture. Context is clearly orthogonal to usage because a
   same usage may require different features depending of the context.
   It is clear that there is no global policy meeting requirements of all
   possible usages and contexts. To address this problem, we propose to
   define a correspondence model which for a given usage and context allows
   to derive a correspondence type encapsulating the exact set of required
   features. With this model, it becomes possible to define an advanced
   email system which may cope with multiple policies instead of a single
   monolithic one. By allowing a user to select the exact policy coping
   with her needs, we argue that our approach reduces the risk-taking
   allowing the email system to slide from a trusted one to a confident
   one.},

Title = {Older Patients' Enthusiasm to Use Electronic Mail to Communicate With
   Their Physicians: Cross-Sectional Survey},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Recent evidence indicates increased access to and use of
   Internet and non-healthcare-related email by older patients. Because
   email adoption could potentially reduce some of the disparities faced by
   this age group, there is a need to understand factors determining older
   patients' enthusiasm to use email to communicate with their physicians.
   Electronic mail (email) represents a means of communication that,
   coupled with face-to-face communication, could enhance quality of care
   for older patients.
   Objective: Testa model to determine factors associated with older
   patients' enthusiasm to use email to communicate with their physicians.
   Methods: We conducted a secondary data analysis of survey data collected
   in 2003 for two large, longitudinal, randomized controlled trials.
   Logistic-regression models were used to model the dichotomous outcome of
   patient enthusiasm for using email to communicate with their physicians.
   Explanatory variables included demographic characteristics, health
   status, use of email with people other than their physician,
   characteristics of the physician-patient relationship, and physician
   enthusiasm to use email with patients.
   Results: Participants included a pooled sample of 4059 patients over 65
   years of age and their respective physicians (n = 181) from
   community-based practices in Southern California. Although only 52
   (1.3\%) patient respondents reported that they communicated with their
   physician by email, about half (49.3\%) expressed enthusiasm about the
   possibility of using it. Odds of being enthusiastic decreased with
   increased age (by 0.97 for each year over 66) but were significantly
   higher in African Americans (OR = 2.1, CI = 1.42 - 3.06), Hispanics (OR
   = 1.6, CI = 1.26 - 2.14) and men (OR = 1.3, CI = 1.1 - 1.5). A
   perception of better communication skills of their physician, lower
   quality of interaction with physician in traditional face-to-face
   encounters, and physician enthusiasm to use email with patients were
   significantly associated with an enthusiasm to use email. Patients who
   did not use email at all were less enthusiastic compared to those who
   used email for other reasons. Half of the physician respondents were not
   enthusiastic about communicating with patients using email.
   Conclusions: Despite perceived barriers such as limited access to the
   Internet, older patients seem to want to use email to communicate with
   their physicians.},

Abstract = {Account recovery (usually through a password reset) on many websites has
   mainly relied on accessibility to a registered email, due to its
   favorable deployability and usability. However, it makes a user's online
   accounts vulnerable to a single point of failure when the registered
   email account is compromised. While previous research focuses on
   strengthening user passwords, the security risk imposed by email-based
   password recovery has not yet been well studied. In this article, we
   first conduct a measurement study to characterize the password recovery
   activities in the wild. Specifically, we examine the authentication and
   password recovery protocols from 239 traffic-heavy websites, confirming
   that most of them use emails for password recovery. We further
   scrutinize the security policy of leading email service providers and
   show that a significant portion of them takes no or marginal effort to
   protect user email accounts, leaving compromised email accounts readily
   available for mounting password recovery attacks. Then, we conduct case
   studies to assess potential losses caused by such attacks. Finally, we
   propose and implement a lightweight email security enhancement called
   Secure Email Account Recovery (SEAR) to defend against password recovery
   attacks by adding an extra layer of protection to password recovery
   emails.},

Abstract = {Abnormal email bounces seriously disrupt user lives and company
   transactions. Proliferating security protocols and protection strategies
   have made email delivery increasingly complex. A natural question is how
   and why email delivery fails in the wild. Filling this knowledge gap
   requires a representative global email delivery dataset, which is rarely
   disclosed by email service providers (ESPs).
   In this paper, we first systematically reveal the scale and root causes
   of email bounces, and evaluate the email squatting risk in the real
   world. Through a 15-month passive dataset from a large ESP, we present a
   unique global view of 298M emails delivered to 3M receiver mail servers
   in 169 countries. We find that 38M (12.93\%) emails fail to be delivered
   in the first attempt, about one-third of which could be successfully
   delivered after retrying, while the rest are permanently undeliverable.
   Delving deeper into bounce reasons, we observe that poor server
   reputation and network communication quality are significant factors
   leading to temporary email bounces. In particular, spam blocklists
   affect many normal email deliveries. The misconfiguration of
   authentication mechanisms and email address typos result in many
   permanently undeliverable emails. More seriously, many email addresses
   with significant residual value can be exploited by squatting attackers.
   Overall, we call for the community to revisit email delivery failures,
   especially to improve standards for email bounce reporting and
   resolution.},

Title = {On the Security of Practical Mail User Agents against Cache Side-Channel
   Attacks},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Mail user agent (MUA) programs provide an integrated interface for email
   services. Many MUAs support email encryption functionality to ensure the
   confidentiality of emails. In practice, they encrypt the content of an
   email using email encryption standards such as OpenPGP or S/MIME, mostly
   implemented using GnuPG. Despite their widespread deployment, there has
   been insufficient research on their software structure and the security
   dependencies among the software components of MUA programs. In order to
   understand the security implications of the structures and analyze any
   possible vulnerabilities of MUA programs, we investigated a number of
   MUAs that support email encryption. As a result, we found severe
   vulnerabilities in a number of MUAs that allow cache side-channel
   attacks in virtualized desktop environments. Our analysis reveals that
   the root cause originates from the lack of verification and control over
   the third-party cryptographic libraries that they adopt. In order to
   demonstrate this, we implemented a cache side-channel attack on RSA in
   GnuPG and then conducted an evaluation of the vulnerability of 13 MUAs
   that support email encryption in Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04 and 18.04. Based on
   our experiment, we found that 10 of these MUA programs (representing
   approximately 77\% of existing MUA programs) allow the installation of a
   vulnerable version of GnuPG, even when the latest version of GnuPG,
   which is secure against most cache side-channel attacks, is in use. In
   order to substantiate the importance of the vulnerability we discovered,
   we conducted a FLUSH+RELOAD attack on these MUA programs and
   demonstrated that the attack restored 92\% of the bits of the 2048-bit
   RSA private key when the recipients read a single encrypted email.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a framework to address
   the problem that email users are not well-informed or assisted by their
   email clients in identifying possible phishing attacks, thereby putting
   their personal information at risk. This paper therefore addresses the
   human weakness (i.e. the user's lack of knowledge of phishing attacks
   which causes them to fall victim to such attacks) as well as the
   software related issue of email clients not visually assisting and
   guiding the users through the user interface.
   Design/methodology/approach - Aliterature study was conducted in the
   main field of information security with a specific focus on
   understanding phishing attacks and a modelling technique was used to
   represent the proposed framework. This paper argues that the framework
   can be suitably implemented for email clients to raise awareness about
   phishing attacks. To validate the framework as a plausible mechanism, it
   was reviewed by a focus group within the School of Information and
   Communication Technology (ICT) at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan
   University (NMMU). The focus group consisted of academics and research
   students in the field of information security.
   Findings - This paper argues that email clients should make use of
   feedback mechanisms to present security related aspects to their users,
   so as to make them aware of the characteristics pertaining to phishing
   attacks. To support this argument, it presents a framework to assist
   email users in the identification of phishing attacks.
   Research limitations/implications - Future research would yield
   interesting results if the proposed framework were implemented into an
   existing email client to determine the effect of the framework on the
   user's level of awareness of phishing attacks. Furthermore, the list of
   characteristics could be expanded to include all phishing types (such as
   clone phishing, smishing, vishing and pharming). This would make the
   framework more dynamic in that it could then address all forms of
   phishing attacks.
   Practical implications - The proposed framework could enable email
   clients to provide assistance through the user interface. Visibly
   relaying the security level to the users of the email client, and
   providing short descriptions as to why a certain email is considered
   suspicious, could result in raising the awareness of the average email
   user with regard to phishing attacks.
   Originality/value - This research presents a framework that email
   clients can use to identify common forms of normal and spear phishing
   attacks. The proposed framework addresses the problem that the average
   Internet user lacks a baseline level of online security awareness. It
   argues that the email client is the ideal place to raise the awareness
   of users regarding phishing attacks.},

Abstract = {We invent a novel context aware privacy enhancing keyboard (PEK) for
   touch-enabled devices to keep users safe from various password inference
   attacks. When a user inputs normal text like an email or a message, PEK
   shows a normal QWERTY keyboard. However, every time a user of a
   touch-enabled device presses a password input box on the screen, we will
   randomly shuffle the positions of the characters on the keyboard and
   show this randomized keyboard to the user. PEK was released on the
   Google Play in 2014, but the number of installations is below our
   expectation now. For the purpose of usable security and privacy, we
   design a two-stage usability test and perform extensive experiments to
   evaluate the user experience of PEK and discover the reason behind the
   lukewarmness of using PEK. We implement two new features so as to
   improve PEK based on the feedback of usability tests.},

Abstract = {Email address leakages are the cause of several security problems
   including spam and privacy loss. With current email addresses, once the
   address leaks without its owner's consent, it becomes effectively
   compromised, creating a struggle for the user to keep the address out of
   the hands of new spammers. To compound the problem, some websites
   require addresses belonging to a certain domain (e.g., <university>.edu)
   as a partial proof of the user's affiliation with an organization. This
   leaves the user not much choice except to have faith that the address
   will not be misused.
   To address the problem, this paper improves on the prior work on
   disposable email addresses by proposing a mechanism called semiprivate
   aliases. Semi-private aliases make two contributions. First, they have a
   lifecycle model that permits gradual, selective controls on the use of
   the alias by senders without requiring any special infrastructure on the
   part of senders or receivers. Second, semiprivate aliases can be easily
   used to validate a user belonging to a certain organization (e.g.,
   university or company) and reveal only selected attributes to a service
   while hiding the real identity. The second aspect recently proved useful
   in allowing students in one of our freshmen courses to register easily
   and safely at Piazza.com, a discussion forum for courses, that, by
   default, requires students to provide a university email address, but
   has privacy policies that differ from a university's.},

Abstract = {End-to-end encryption has been heralded by privacy and security
   researchers as an effective defence against dragnet surveillance, but
   there is no evidence of widespread end-user uptake. We argue that the
   non-adoption of end-to-end encryption might not be entirely due to
   usability issues identified by Whitten and Tygar in their seminal paper
   ``Why Johnny Can't Encrypt{''}. Our investigation revealed a number of
   fundamental issues such as incomplete threat models, misaligned
   incentives, and a general absence of understanding of the email
   architecture. From our data and related research literature we found
   evidence of a number of potential explanations for the low uptake of
   end-to-end encryption. This suggests that merely increasing the
   availability and usability of encryption functionality in email clients
   will not automatically encourage increased deployment by email users. We
   shall have to focus, first, on building comprehensive end-user mental
   models related to email, and email security. We conclude by suggesting
   directions for future research.},

   mail user agents found in practice still violates best practices in UI
   design and uses ineffective and inhomogeneous design strategies to
   communicate and let users control the security status of an email
   message.
   We propose a novel interaction and design concept that we refer to as
   persuasive message design. Our approach is derived from heuristics and a
   systematic meta-study of existing HCI literature on email management,
   usable secure email and phishing research. Concluding on this body of
   knowledge we propose the design of interfaces that suppress weak cues
   and instead manipulate the display of emails according to their
   technical security level. Persuasive message design addresses several
   shortcomings of current secure email user interfaces and provides a
   consistent user experience that can be deployed even by email providers.},

Abstract = {Spoofing is a very common security threat to email applications. Several
   powerful techniques have been developed to counteract spoofing, but most
   of them are server-oriented and transparent to the user. In this paper a
   client-oriented Secure Socket Layer (SSL)-based anti-spoofing
   application is proposed. This application allows a client to send
   trusted emails and authenticate received emails using the SSL protocol.
   The application has been developed in Java and it provides users with a
   table populated with details of all devices on a subnet. It uses
   cryptographic self-signed certificates to exchange a secure
   authentication message alongside the email with a view to prevent
   spoofing. The application has been tested on devices within the same
   subnet and it successfully authenticated valid email messages and
   detected spoofed ones. The main advantages of this application are the
   incorporation of SSL, its user-friendliness and its ability to allow
   users to use anti-spoofing measures independently of an email server.},

Abstract = {Online email archives are an under-protected yet extremely sensitive
   information resource. Email archives can store years worth of personal
   and business email in an easy-to-access form, one that is much easier to
   compromise than messages being transmitted ``on the wire.{''} Most email
   archives, however are protected by reusable passwords that are often
   weak and can be easily compromised. To protect such archives, we propose
   a novel user-specific design for an anomaly-based email archive
   intrusion detection system. As a first step towards building such a
   system, we have developed a simple probabilistic model of user email
   behavior that correlates email senders and a user's disposition of
   emails. In tests using data gathered from three months of observed user
   behavior and synthetic models of attacker behavior this model exhibits a
   low rate of false positives (generally one false alarm every few weeks)
   while still detecting most attacks. These results suggest that anomaly
   detection is a feasible strategy for securing email archives, one that
   does not require changes in user authentication or access behavior.},

Abstract = {Spoofing is a serious security issue for email applications. Although
   several anti-email spoofing techniques have been developed, most of them
   do not provide users with sufficient control and information on spoof
   attacks. In this paper a web-based client oriented anti-spoofing email
   application is proposed which actively detects, monitors and controls
   email spoofing attacks. When the application detects a spoofed message,
   it triggers an alert message and sends the spoofed message into a spoof
   filter. Moreover, the user who has received the spoofed message is given
   the option of notifying the real sender of the spoofing attack. In this
   way an active spoof control is achieved. The application is hosted using
   the HTTPS protocol and uses notification messages that are sent in
   parallel with email messages via a channel that has been secured by the
   Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. The notification messages allows the
   application to detect spoofed emails. The application has been developed
   in PHP using the Netbeans IDE and provides a user-friendly interface
   which is easily deployable over the web.},

Abstract = {E-mail technology, has become one of the requirements of human lives for
   correspondence between individuals. Given this, the important point is
   that the messages, server and client of e-mail and correspondences that
   exchanged between different people have acceptable security, to make
   people sure to use of this technology. In the information age, many of
   financial and non financial transactions are done electronically, data
   exchange takes place via the internet and theft and manipulation of data
   can make exorbitant cost in terms of integrity, financial, political,
   economic and culture. E-mail correspondence in there is same and it is
   very important. With review took place, a method that will focus on
   email system for risks assessment is not provided. We are examining ways
   of assessing for other systems and their strengths and weaknesses, then
   we use Mr Convery method for assessing email risks which it is for

Abstract = {The use of Information Technology (IT) has become common practice in our
   everyday lives both for business and private purposes. While people
   enjoy the convenience that IT offers, it also poses various security
   threats if not used properly, including malware, hacking, and
   information disclosure. Unfortunately, the scale and consequence of
   cyber threats has increased significantly year-on-year despite various
   security controls having been developed and deployed. It is evident that
   end users play a significant role within the information security
   domain, as they are frequently the primary target and the main force
   behind incidents. Nonetheless, whilst there are annual security surveys
   for organisations, less effort were given regarding assessing how
   individuals practice information security by the research community.
   Therefore, this paper presents a survey that investigates user's IT
   security practice and behaviour. In total, 400 respondents were surveyed
   during a five month period (i.e. November 2014 - March 2015). Overall,
   the results demonstrate that end users practice better IT security than
   typically thought although it appears only at a relatively basic level.
   For example, whilst a reasonably good proportion of participants (66\%)
   claimed that they never share their passwords with others, 76\% have
   used the same password on multiple sensitive accounts. Almost three
   quarters (72\%) of responders never click on links or attachments within
   emails from unknown sources, but this is significantly reduced (to 36\%)
   when someone they knew sent the email. Two-thirds of users (65\%) do
   appreciate the importance of antivirus software as they always keep
   their antivirus software updated; however, less care is given to other
   applications/systems as only 44\% would do the same and more alarmingly
   65\% even cancel or delay the security update process. Over two thirds
   (68\%) of participants do not always backup their data, and only half of
   the participants (53\%) claimed that they always destroy their data
   before hardware disposal. The results of the survey suggest that whilst
   levels of awareness are improving, there is still a significant gap
   between existing and required levels of information security knowledge
   and practice. Arguably, users are currently being overwhelmed by the
   burden being placed upon them to remain secure. The range of
   technologies they use (60\% using more than 3 devices), the widespread
   use of online services (89\% using at least 5 IT services) highlight
   users are becoming or have become technology dependent but perhaps
   without being security savvy.},

Abstract = {Control mechanisms established on the boundary of an information system
   are an important preliminary step to minimising losses from security
   breaches. The primary function of such controls is to restrict the use
   of information systems and resources to authorized users. Password-based
   systems remain the predominant method of user authentication despite the
   many sophisticated and viable security alternatives that have emerged
   from research and development. However, the literature shows that
   passwords are often compromised through the poor security and management
   practices of users. This paper examines user password composition and
   security practices for email accounts. The results of a survey that
   examines user practice in creating and using passwords are reported. The
   results show that many users know about the risks of hackers, viruses
   and so on and take preliminary steps to combat them such as having
   passwords longer than eight characters. However, this appears to be as
   far as many users are willing to accede to the probability that their
   information and computing resources can be compromised. This paper makes
   some recommendations for the education of users in creating and
   maintaining their passwords. The responsibility for these educational
   programs can be shared between governments, organisations, educational
   institutions at all levels, and software vendors.},

Abstract = {With the development of the Internet, email has become a part of our
   life to communicate with each other. While bringing convenience for
   users, it also threats the users' network security. For example, if the
   user clicks on a malicious URL link in the email, the user's host is
   likely to be injected by virus, resulting in subsequent network security
   problems. We call the Internet users' operations on email ``users' email
   behaviors{''}. Through simulating the user's behavior on email, we can
   find the hidden dangers and threats of network security caused by user's
   operation on email. In this paper, BP-BDI model is proposed to simulate
   the user's behavior on email. The behavior learning module with BP
   neural network is constructed on the basis of BDI (Belief Desire
   Intention) model to learn the user's past behavior of email. As a
   result, the accuracy of simulating the user's email behavior will be
   improved. Finally, the experiment proves that the BP-BDI model can
   simulate the user's email behavior accurately and effectively.},

Abstract = {The ubiquity of the Internet and email, have provided a mostly insecure
   communication medium for the consumer. During the last few decades, we
   have seen the development of several ways to secure email messages.
   However, these solutions are inflexible and difficult to use for
   encrypting email messages to protect security and privacy while
   communicating or collaborating via email. Under the current paradigm,
   the arduous process of setting up email encryption is non-intuitive for
   the average user. The complexity of the current practices has also
   yielded to incorrect developers' interpretation of architecture which
   has resulted in interoperability issues. As a result, the lack of simple
   and easy-to-use infrastructure in current practices means that the
   consumers still use plain text emails over insecure networks.
   In this paper, we introduce and describe a novel, holistic model with
   new techniques for protecting email messages. The architecture of our
   innovative model is simpler and easier to use than those currently
   employed. We use the simplified trust model, which can relieve users
   from having to perform many complex steps to achieve email security.
   Utilizing the new techniques presented in this paper can safeguard
   users' email from unauthorized access and protect their privacy. In
   addition, a simplified infrastructure enables developers to understand
   the architecture more readily eliminating interoperability.},

Abstract = {A structured analysis of peer-reviewed literature about the delivery of
   health services by email was undertaken for this review. A total of 185
   articles were included in the analysis. These articles were thematically
   categorised for medical specialty, participants, sub-topic, study design
   and service-delivery application.
   It was shown that email-based telemedicine can be practiced in a large
   number of medical specialties and has application in primary
   consultation, second opinion consultation, telediagnosis and
   administrative roles (e.g. e-referral). Email has niche applications in
   low-bandwidth, image-based specialties (e.g. dermatology, pathology,
   wound care and ophthalmology) where attached digital camera images were
   used for telediagnosis. Diagnostic accuracy of these images was the
   predominant topic of research and results show email as a valid means of
   delivering these medical services. Email is also often used in general
   practice as an adjunct for face-to-face consultation. Further, a number
   of organisations have significantly improved the efficiency of their
   outpatient services when using email as a triage or e-referral system.
   Email-based telemedicine provides specialist medical opinion in the
   majority of reviewed services and is most likely to be instigated by the
   patient's primary care giver. However, email-consultations between
   patient and primary care and patient and secondary care are not
   uncommon.
   Most email services are implemented using ordinary email. However, a
   number of organisations have developed purpose-written email
   applications to support their telemedicine service due to impediments of
   using ordinary email. These impediments include lack of management tools
   for: the allocation and auditing of cases for a timely response and the
   co-ordination of effort in a multiclinician, multi-disciplinary service.
   The ability to encrypt ordinary email thereby securing patient
   confidentiality is also regarded as difficult when using ordinary email.
   Hence, alternative web-based email applications where the encryption can
   be implemented using the more user-friendly HTTPS have become popular.
   Much of the reviewed literature is descriptive or anecdotal and hence,
   suffers from lack of conclusive results regarding positive patient
   outcomes. This may account for email-based telemedicine generally being
   regarded as underutilised. However, the potential is well recognised.},

Abstract = {Email and other forms of electronic communication are becoming
   increasingly more essential to our everyday lives. However, with this
   growth comes the paralleled increased risk of email harassment,
   exacerbated by the current lack of platform support for managing these
   harmful messages. This paper explores different interfaces for the
   automated detection and management of email harassment using artificial
   intelligence in order to investigate what degree of platform
   intervention email users prefer when navigating their email platform.
   Through conducting user studies involving three different email platform
   prototypes based on the Gmail platform, we employ mixed-method analysis
   to evaluate how varying levels of platform intervention affect users'
   perceived sense of safety, agency, and trust with their email platform.
   Our primary findings suggest that users generally benefited from each of
   the system intervention strategies and desired higher intervention
   features when combating email harassment, as well as ways of managing
   this intervention based on their unique preferences.},

Abstract = {Cyber criminals use phishing emails in highvolume and spear phishing
   emails in low volume to achieve their malicious objectives. Hereby they
   inflict financial, reputational, and emotional damages on individuals
   and organizations. These (spear) phishing attacks get steadily more
   sophisticated as cyber criminals use social engineering tricks that
   combine psychological and technical deceptions to make malicious emails
   as trustworthy as possible. Such sophisticated (spear) phishing emails
   are hard for email protection systems to detect. Security researchers
   have studied users' ability to perceive, identify and react upon email
   (spear) phishing attacks. In this study we have surveyed recent works on
   understanding how to prevent endusers from falling for email (spear)
   phishing attacks. Based on the survey we design and propose a novice
   method that combines interaction methods of reporting, blocking,
   warning, and embedded education to harness the intelligence of expert
   and novice users in a corporate environment in detecting email (spear)
   phishing attacks. We evaluate the design based on a qualitative study,
   in three experimental steps, by using a mockup prototype, and with 24
   participants. We report on the insights gained, indicating that the
   proposed combination of the interaction methods is promising, and on
   future research directions.},

Abstract = {Due to the protection of data security and personal privacy in email
   networks, it is difficult to select the neighbor user using email user's
   personalized attributes and behavior data. In daily life, the more
   interactive the people are, the more similar they are. So many
   researchers use the interaction strength to select the neighbor users.
   But this method has not been experimentally verified. Receiving the same
   email is the most basic condition that a neighbor user can provide a
   valid recommendation to the target user. So, we build an email corpus
   using real email data to verify the selection effect of different
   methods. The emails come from Enron email data set, log files of a
   Chinese corporate email server, and volunteers. This corpus contains
   more than 870,000 users and more than 5.14 million emails. With this
   corpus, we conducted experiments on seven different methods of neighbor
   user selection. The experimental results show the effect of user
   interaction strength is far from being as good as expected, and far
   inferior to user social attributes. In addition, the recipient performs
   far better than the sender. This paper provides a useful reference for
   the research of spam filtering based on user-based collaborative
   recommendation filtering in mail network.},

Abstract = {Every day over 29 billion spam and phishing messages are sent. Commonly
   the spammers use compromised email accounts to send these emails, which
   accounted for 57.9 percent of the global email traffic in September
   2014. Previous research has primarily focused on the fast detection of
   abused accounts to prevent the fraudulent use of servers.
   State-of-the-art spam detection methods generally need the content of
   the email to classify it as either spam or a regular message. This
   content is not available within the new type of encrypted phishing
   emails that have become prevalent since the middle of 2014. The object
   of the presented research is to detect the anomaly with Mail User Agent
   Access Activities, which is based on the special behaviour of how to
   send emails without the knowledge of the email content. The proposed
   method detects the abused account in seconds and therefore reduces the
   sent spam per compromised account to less than one percent.},

Title = {Exploring the evidence for email phishing training: A scoping review},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {139},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: Phishing emails are a pervasive threat to the security of
   confidential information. To mitigate this risk, a range of training
   measures have been developed to target the human factors involved in
   phishing email susceptibility. Despite the widespread use of
   anti-phishing training programs, there is no clear understanding of the
   extent to which these approaches have been assessed. Objective: The
   primary aim of this scoping review was to identify and describe the
   nature of available training interventions and their measurable outcomes
   on user susceptibility, as reported in published articles. Methods:
   Systematic searches identified 42 studies that met the inclusion
   criteria. Each study was critically analysed, and a standardised data
   extraction spreadsheet used to systemise the data that informed the
   descriptive narrative review. Results: Findings revealed that near-term
   training impact is well documented, however evidence on the success of
   programs in driving sustained behavioral change is limited. Components
   of training design influencing the effectiveness of outcomes included
   training intensity, active approaches to learning, the provision of
   detailed feedback, and supplementing attentional awareness skills-based
   training with traditional cue-based approaches. Conclusions: Improved
   user resilience to phishing emails confirms the utility of training as
   an important defensive mechanism, although current approaches continue
   to leave trainees at risk.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we have provided an interactive email phishing training
   website to complete the presented security strategy for a Qatar
   organisation based on targeted email phishing which is Email Phishing
   Training. The problem that leads users to be hacked using phishing
   emails is a lack of awareness on the domain senders. Over half of the
   email users do not have knowledge on phishing domain senders. The Email
   Phishing Training project aims to provide email phishing and targeted
   phishing awareness to organisations and government institutions through
   interactive training in the State of Qatar. In this study, we have
   presented a new idea on how to familiarize people to user domain senders
   using an interactive website. Training will be presented for each user
   based on a pre-quiz on the knowledge of the users then a quiz will be
   conducted based on the learning outcomes. The results show that the
   presented idea is an effective solution to tackle phishing emails.},

   designed to convince a victim to provide personal information, usually
   for the monetary gain of the attacker (phisher). Attempts to stop

   prevention of phishing by combining automatic and transparent email
   signing with an email client plugin. The plugin can detect unsigned
   spoofed messages. In this manner, the user is prevented (or at least
   discouraged) from visiting malicious web sites, thus stopping the
   data-gathering phase of the phishing attack before it begins. We
   describe the system, implementation, weaknesses, and our ongoing user

Abstract = {Phishing e-mail threats are increasing in sophistication. Technical
   measures alone do not fully prevent users from falling for them and
   common e-mail interfaces provide little support for users to check an
   e-mail's legitimacy. We designed three email user security tools to
   improve phishing detection within a common e-mail interface and provide
   a formative evaluation of the usability of these features: two
   psychological nudges to alert users of suspicious e-mails and a
   ``check{''} button to enable users to verify an email's legitimacy.
   Professional email users (N = 27) found the ``suspicion score{''} nudge
   and ``check{''} button the most useful. These alerted users of
   suspicious e-mails, without harming their productivity, and helped users
   assert trust in legitimate ones. The other nudge was too easily ignored
   or too disruptive to be effective. We also found that users arrive at
   erroneous judgements due to differing interpretations of e-mail details,
   even though two-thirds of them completed cybersecurity training before.
   These findings show that usable and therefore effective e-mail user
   security tools can be developed by leveraging cues of legitimacy that
   augment existing user behaviour, instead of emphasising technical
   security training.},

Abstract = {Due to the critical security threats imposed by email-based malware in
   recent years, modeling the propagation dynamics of email malware becomes
   a fundamental technique for predicting its potential damages and
   developing effective countermeasures. Compared to earlier versions of
   email malware, modern email malware exhibits two new features,
   reinfection and self-start. Reinfection refers to the malware behavior
   that modern email malware sends out malware copies whenever any healthy
   or infected recipients open the malicious attachment. Self-start refers
   to the behavior that malware starts to spread whenever compromised
   computers restart or certain files are visited. In the literature,
   several models are proposed for email malware propagation, but they did
   not take into account the above two features and cannot accurately model
   the propagation dynamics of modern email malware. To address this
   problem, we derive a novel difference equation based analytical model by
   introducing a new concept of virtual infected user. The proposed model
   can precisely present the repetitious spreading process caused by
   reinfection and self-start and effectively overcome the associated
   computational challenges. We perform comprehensive empirical and
   theoretical study to validate the proposed analytical model. The results
   show our model greatly outperforms previous models in terms of
   estimation accuracy.},

Abstract = {To send encrypted emails, users typically need to create and exchange
   keys which later should be manually authenticated, for instance, by
   comparing long strings of characters. These tasks are cumbersome for the
   average user. To make more accessible the use of encrypted email, a
   secure email application named p equivalent to p automates the key
   management operations; p equivalent to p still requires the users to
   carry out the verification, however, the authentication process is
   simple: users have to compare familiar words instead of strings of
   random characters, then the application shows the users what level of
   trust they have achieved via colored visual indicators. Yet, users may
   not execute the authentication ceremony as intended, p equivalent to p's
   trust rating may be wrongly assigned, or both. To learn whether p
   equivalent to p's trust ratings (and the corresponding visual
   indicators) are assigned consistently, we present a formal security
   analysis of p equivalent to p's authentication ceremony. From the
   software implementation in C, we derive the specifications of an
   abstract protocol for public key distribution, encryption and trust
   establishment; then, we model the protocol in a variant of the applied
   pi calculus and later formally verify and validate specific privacy and
   authentication properties. We also discuss alternative research
   directions that could enrich the analysis.},

Abstract = {One of the most prevalent security problems in network is the rampant
   propagation of email worms. Unlike active worms, the email worm has to
   be activated by user action in order to spread further. This paper deals
   with modeling email worm propagation by analyzing and combining human
   factors. Impact of human factors on email worm propagation is
   investigated and discussed. Results of email worm propagation under a
   practical simulation environment show that the presented model well
   describes the email worm behavior. Conclusions are also drawn that
   infection probability decreases (luring evolution of worm infection due
   to the security consciousness rising, and highly connected nodes are
   more susceptible.},

   framework. The study found that security and trust affects the perceived

   which type of email client is used. Evidence suggests that the model may
   be a suitable solution for increasing the usefulness of email in
   computer supported collaborative learning, and can help to strengthen

Abstract = {In this paper, we study the concept of security zones as an intermediate
   layer of compartmentalization on mobile devices. Each of these security
   zones is isolated against the other zones and holds a different set of
   applications and associated user data and may apply different security
   policies. From a user point of view, they represent different contexts
   of use for the device, e.g., to distinguish between gaming (private
   context), payment transactions (secure context), and company-related
   email (enterprise context). We propose multiple visualization methods
   for conveying the current security zone information to the user, and
   interaction methods for switching between zones. Based on an online and
   a laboratory user study, we evaluated these concepts from a usability
   point of view. One important result is that in the tension field between
   security and usability, additional hardware can support the user's
   awareness toward their zone context.},

Title = {New filtering approaches for phishing email},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SECURITY},
Year = {2010},

Abstract = {Phishing emails usually contain a message from a credible looking source
   requesting a user to click a link to a website where she/he is asked to
   enter a password or other confidential information. Most phishing emails
   aim at withdrawing money from financial institutions or getting access
   to private information. Phishing has increased enormously over the last
   years and is a serious threat to global security and economy. There are
   a number of possible countermeasures to phishing. These range from
   communicationoriented approaches like authentication protocols over
   blacklisting to content-based filtering approaches.
   We argue that the first two approaches are currently not broadly
   implemented or exhibit deficits. Therefore content-based phishing
   filters are necessary and widely used to increase communication
   security. A number of features are extracted capturing the content and
   structural properties of the email. Subsequently a statistical
   classifier is trained using these features on a training set of emails
   labeled as ham (legitimate), spam or phishing. This classifier may then
   be applied to an email stream to estimate the classes of new incoming
   emails.
   In this paper we describe a number of novel features that are
   particularly well-suited to identify phishing emails. These include
   statistical models for the low-dimensional descriptions of email topics,
   sequential analysis of email text and external links, the detection of
   embedded logos as well as indicators for hidden salting. Hidden salting
   is the intentional addition or distortion of content not perceivable by
   the reader. For empirical evaluation we have obtained a large realistic
   corpus of emails prelabeled as spam, phishing, and ham (legitimate). In
   experiments our methods outperform other published approaches for
   classifying phishing emails. We discuss the implications of these
   results for the practical application of this approach in the workflow
   of an email provider. Finally we describe a strategy how the filters may
   be updated and adapted to new types of phishing.},

Abstract = {Over the years, email has evolved into one of the most widely used
   communication channels for both individuals and organizations. However,
   despite near ubiquitous use in much of the world, current information
   technology standards do not place emphasis on email security. Not until
   recently, webmail services such as Yahoo's mail and Google's gmail
   started to encrypt emails for privacy protection. However, the encrypted
   emails will be decrypted and stored in the service provider's servers.
   If the servers are malicious or compromised, all the stored emails can
   be read, copied and altered. Thus, there is a strong need for end-to-end
   (E2E) email encryption to protect email user's privacy. In this paper,
   we present a certificateless one-way group key agreement protocol with
   the following features, which are suitable to implement E2E email
   encryption: (1) certificateless and thus there is no key escrow problem
   and no public key certificate infrastructure is required; (2) one-way
   group key agreement and thus no back-and-forth message exchange is
   required; and (3) n-party group key agreement (not just 2- or 3-party).
   This paper also provides a security proof for the proposed protocol
   using ``proof by simulation{''}. Finally, efficiency analysis of the
   protocol is presented at the end of the paper.},

Abstract = {Ciphire Mail is cryptographic software that provides email encryption
   and digital signatures. The Ciphire Mail client resides on the user's
   computer between the email client and the email server, intercepting,
   encrypting, decrypting, signing, and authenticating email communication.
   During normal operation, all operations are performed in the background,
   making it very easy to use even for non-technical users. Ciphire Mail
   provides automated secure public-key exchange using an automated
   fingerprinting system. It uses cryptographic hash values to identify and
   validate certificates, thus enabling clients to detect malicious
   modification of certificates. This data is automatically circulated
   among clients, making it impossible to execute fraud without alerting
   users. The Ciphire system is a novel concept for making public-key
   cryptography and key exchange usable for email communication. It is the
   first transparent email encryption system that allows everyone to secure
   their communications without a steep learning curve.},

Abstract = {E-mail has a wealth of information, including work topics, interactions
   between people, and the evolution of events over time. The emails will
   give users a better understanding that how things have changed and
   evolved in the past. Much of the effort to visualize email has focused
   on three areas of email archiving: exploring the relationship between
   email volumes, mining the evolution of topics and events in emails, or
   the relationship of email owners to their counterparts. But there are
   currently fewer systems for analyzing their background stories through
   mail dataset. In this paper, we present the Mail event, which is an
   email visualization system. Its main purpose is to help users analyze
   the main information in the mail data set, such as keywords, topics, and
   event contents of the mail. Firstly, it helps users understand the
   keywords and themes of the mail through a variety of different attempts.
   Secondly, the way the email is matched into an event allows the user to
   understand the story of the email corresponding to the email at a
   certain point in time so that users can deeply understand the story
   behind the email. In this system, through rich visual elements, users
   can understand the e-mail dataset and have a further understanding of
   the development of events and their anomalies, so as to better
   coordinate or improve future work. Finally, the effectiveness of the
   system is verified by case studies and user evaluation experiments.},

Title = {UIPA: User authentication method based on user interface preferences for
   account recovery process},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {52},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Because of the global increment of various computer implementation, the
   usage of the internet has increased significantly. This phenomenon has
   mainly contributed to the growing usage of the World Wide Web, which is
   considered as one of the inventions in computer technology that changed
   the modes of human communication and exchange of information. As new
   work tools, an increasing number of people are using online systems.
   Accordingly, user authentication has become a significant issue in the
   online environment. The traditional password is still the most common
   means to verify user identity. However, strong passwords are sometimes
   difficult to remember, and thus a recovery procedure is needed. It can
   be said that the majority of online systems apply different methods of
   recovery, such as using challenging questions besides the out-of-band
   communication (i.e., email or SMS). Nevertheless, these approaches are
   still suffering from security and usability problems. This study
   therefore proposes a novel authentication method based on user interface
   (UI) preferences, called the User Interface Preferences Authentication
   (UIPA). This method can be applied with online systems that offer UI
   designs since it provides users with the chance to choose a preferred
   design of the interface on the basis of their personal characteristics.
   Hence, the user identity is then verified based on that interface. The
   performance, security, and usability of UIPA have been evaluated. The
   results of the experiments show that UIPA has a false positive rate of
   0.416\% and a false negative rate of 0\%. Moreover, a user acceptance
   questionnaire, which has been designed based on the technology
   acceptance model, shows that users are pleased and willing to accept the
   proposed technique. To conclude, UIPA can be applied as an efficient
   account recovery method compared with the currently used methods. It
   could also help in addressing the security-usability trade-off-problem.

Abstract = {Cyber-phishing attacks recently became more precise, targeted, and
   tailored by training data to activate only in the presence of specific
   information or cues. They are adaptable to a much greater extent than
   traditional phishing detection. Hence, automated detection systems
   cannot always be 100\% accurate, increasing the uncertainty around
   expected behavior when faced with a potential phishing email. On the
   other hand, human-centric defence approaches focus extensively on user
   training but face the difficulty of keeping users up to date with
   continuously emerging patterns. Therefore, advances in analyzing the
   content of an email in novel ways along with summarizing the most
   pertinent content to the recipients of emails is a prospective gateway
   to furthering how to combat these threats. Addressing this gap, this
   work leverages transformer-based machine learning to (i) analyze
   prospective psychological triggers, to (ii) detect possible malicious
   intent, and to (iii) create representative summaries of emails. We then
   amalgamate this information and present it to the user to allow them to
   (i) easily decide whether the email is ``phishy{''} and (ii) self-learn
   advanced malicious patterns.},

Title = {PriviPK: Certificate-less and secure email communication},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {70},
Pages = {1-15},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We introduce PriviPK, an infrastructure that is based on a novel
   combination of certificateless (CL) cryptography and key transparency
   techniques to enable e2e email encryption. Our design avoids (1) key
   escrow and deployment problems of previous IBC systems, (2) certificate
   management, as in S/MIME, or participation in complicated Web of Trust,
   as in PGP, and (3) impersonation attacks because it relies on key
   transparency approaches where end users verify their identity and key
   bindings. PriviPK uses a new CL key agreement protocol that has the
   unique property that it allows users to update their public keys without
   the need to contact a third party (such as a CA) for the recertification
   process, which allows for cheap forward secrecy and key revocation
   operations. Furthermore, PriviPK uniquely combines important privacy
   properties such as forward secrecy, deniability (or non-deniability if
   desired), and user transparency while avoiding the administrative
   overhead of certificates for asynchronous communication. PriviPK enables
   quick bootstrapping of shared keys among participating users, allowing
   them to encrypt and authenticate each other transparently. We describe
   an implementation of PriviPK and provide performance measurements that
   show its minimal computational overhead. We also describe our
   PriviPK-enabled e2e secure email client, a modification of The Nylas
   Mail, 2015 email client. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The human factor in phishing: Collecting and analyzing user behavior
   when reading emails},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {139},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Phishing emails are constantly increasing their sophistication, and
   typical countermeasures struggle at addressing them. Attackers target
   our cognitive vulnerabilities with a varied set of techniques, and each
   of us, not trained enough or simply in the wrong moment, can be deceived
   and put an entire organization in trouble. To date, no study has
   evaluated the behavior of users when confronted with phishing emails
   characterized by a diverse set of features and attack strategies. We
   created a system called Spamley from these observations, which has the
   main aim of collecting and sharing data regarding such user behavior.
   Spamley is also meant to disseminate awareness among users. To reach
   these goals, we firstly analyzed the wide scientific literature on
   phishing. Our analysis shows that the focus of studies on phishing has
   more and more shifted from technical to human-oriented aspects. Building
   on this analysis we designed, implemented, and deployed a system
   comprising a web application to test user awareness about phishing,
   featuring a survey to identify the most interesting characteristics of
   users, and fueled by a large and varied set of test emails engineered to
   solicit the several possible cognitive vulnerabilities we all have. We
   describe in details the design and implementation choices, the lessons
   we learned, and the way we filled the gap in the available related work.
   Finally, we use real data from our first 500 users to show how data
   collected can be used for several important analyses, including which
   characteristics of the emails are more relevant for which cognitive
   vulnerability of specific groups of users. Results obtained can guide
   the development of novel email clients as well as tailored training
   programmes. Data collected is available to the scientific community for
   conducting further studies on the important and still unsolved issue of
   email phishing.},

Abstract = {OpenPGP and S/MIME are the two major standards for email end-to-end
   encryption. We show practical attacks against both encryption schemes in
   the context of email. First, we present a design flaw in the key update
   mechanism, allowing a third party to deploy a new key to the
   communication partners. Second, we show how email clients can be tricked
   into acting as an oracle for decryption or signing by exploiting their
   functionality to auto-save drafts. Third, we demonstrate how to
   exfiltrate the private key, based on proprietary mailto parameters
   implemented by various email clients. An evaluation shows that 8 out of
   20 tested email clients are vulnerable to at least one attack. While our
   attacks do not target the underlying cryptographic primitives, they
   raise concerns about the practical security of OpenPGP and S/MIME email
   applications. Finally, we propose countermeasures and discuss their
   advantages and disadvantages.},

Abstract = {Email spoofing is a method of scamming individuals by impersonating a
   trusted correspondent via email. Incidences of successful Business Email
   Compromise (BEC) implemented by email spoofing are rising
   astronomically. Existing security systems are not widely implemented and
   cannot provide perfect protection against a technological threat that
   relies on social engineering for success. When existing security systems
   are implemented the settings are generally not restrictive enough to
   catch the more sophisticated email attacks. Businesses are not
   comfortable with legitimate emails being lost due to security false
   positives.
   Our idea for a solution would add a layer to existing precautions that
   would permit looser server-side security settings but would warn the
   user when discrepancies occur in the header source code that could
   result from a spoofed email. We suggest a client-side sentinel to vet
   email header source code and alert the user to potential problems. This
   software could log alerts, notify company officials, remind users of
   company policies to be followed in the event of suspicious email, and
   could increase user accountability by logging incidents. Users could
   have the option of white-listing frequently flagged trusted
   correspondents which would decrease the annoyance of false positives.},

Abstract = {Malicious email attachments are a common and successful attack vector on
   today's Internet. Sophisticated attackers can craft highly-targeted
   attachments, using publicly available information about potential
   victims to create convincing documents that contain hidden malicious
   payloads. Users who open these attachments using vulnerable applications
   are at a high risk of infection. Unfortunately, current mitigations are
   unreliable, relying either on fallible malware detection techniques or
   user education. In this work, we propose adopting a default policy of
   isolated attachment rendering. Emails bearing attachments are
   transparently rewritten (in a sandboxed virtual machine environment) to
   contain static renderings of the attachments. Users who wish to obtain
   the original attachment are explicitly warned of the dangers of doing so
   - akin to TLS warnings as used in web browsers - before being allowed to
   access the requested documents. We implement this technique in a system
   we call PellucidAttachment . We further report on an extensive user
   study that measures the usability and effectiveness of
   PellucidAttachment in shielding users from attacks. Our evaluation shows
   that adopting email attachment security indicators and an
   isolation-by-default policy results in a significant increase in user
   security, while maintaining the usability of email attachments.},

Abstract = {Millions of users rely on email providers to manage and store their
   personal communications. This vast amount of private information,
   however, is often misused not only by adversaries, but also by the
   providers themselves. End-to-end email encryption is considered the most
   robust defense against this threat; however, its many requirements make
   this approach impractical for protecting everyday emails. In this paper,
   we present EmailCloak, an email alias service with public key encryption
   capabilities. EmailCloak relaxes email encryption requirements by
   relying on a privacy-respecting third-party. Emails sent and received by
   the user are automatically encrypted with her public key by EmailCloak
   before being forwarded to, and stored by her email provider. This
   approach, while seemingly straightforward, offers multiple benefits:
   simplified key management, selective and automatic encryption, advanced
   deployment options and transparency towards other parties. Moreover, our
   experimental evaluation shows that the overhead introduced by EmailCloak
   is adequate for email communications. We have also made our
   implementation publicly available. In doing so, we deliver a practical
   and flexible tool that provides privacy-concerned users with greater
   control over their stored emails.},

Abstract = {In email systems, one of the most widely used attacks is email spoofing,
   in which the source address of the email message is forged to make the
   recipient of the email believe that the email was sent from a legitimate
   source. Several research works have been presented in the past to
   address email spoofing attack. Further, in recent years, the technique
   of memory forensics has evolved significantly where critical evidence is
   extracted from the volatile memory of the target machine during a cyber
   crime investigation. In this paper, we utilize memory forensics to
   detect if the client received any spoofed email. In addition, our memory
   forensics approach detects if the client replied to any spoofed emails.
   The memory of the client machine is acquired on a scheduled basis and
   the acquired memory dump is analyzed to identify spoofing attack and, if
   detected, storing the details in log files that can be used by cyber
   crime investigators. The benefit of applying memory forensics to detect
   spoofed emails is that it guarantees non-repudiation since every action
   performed on a computer is loaded in the system's physical memory,
   including email communication, and hence the user cannot deny receiving
   or replying to spoofed email.},

Title = {Why TLS is better without STARTTLS: A Security Analysis of STARTTLS in
   the Email Context},

Abstract = {TLS is one of today's most widely used and best-analyzed encryption
   technologies. However, for historical reasons, TLS for email protocols
   is often not used directly but negotiated via STARTTLS. This additional
   negotiation adds complexity and was prone to security vulnerabilities
   such as naive STARTTLS stripping or command injection attacks in the
   past.
   We perform the first structured analysis of STARTTLS in SMTP, POP3, and
   IMAP and introduce EAST, a semiautomatic testing toolkit with more than
   100 test cases covering a wide range of variants of STARTTLS stripping,
   command and response injections, tampering attacks, and UI spoofing
   attacks for email protocols. Our analysis focuses on the confidentiality
   and integrity of email submission (email client to SMTP server) and
   email retrieval (email client to POP3 or IMAP server). While some of our
   findings are also relevant for email transport (from one SMTP server to
   another), the security implications in email submission and retrieval
   are more critical because these connections involve not only individual
   email messages but also user credentials that allow access to a user's
   email archive.
   We used EAST to analyze 28 email clients and 23 servers. In total, we
   reported over 40 STARTTLS issues, some of which allow mailbox spoofing,
   credential stealing, and even the hosting of HTTPS with a cross-protocol
   attack on IMAP. We conducted an Internet-wide scan for the particularly
   dangerous command injection attack and found that 320.000 email servers
   (2\% of all email servers) are affected. Surprisingly, several clients
   were vulnerable to STARTTLS stripping attacks. In total, only 3 out of
   28 clients did not show any STARTTLS-specific security issues. Even
   though the command injection attack received multiple CVEs in the past,
   EAST detected eight new instances of this problem. In total, only 7 out
   of 23 tested servers were never affected by this issue. We conclude that
   STARTTLS is error-prone to implement, under-specified in the standards,
   and should be avoided.},

Abstract = {Email bombing is a form of Denial of Service (DoS) attack that consists
   of sending huge volumes of email to one or more email addresses to
   overflow the mailbox or overwhelm the server where the mailbox is
   hosted. While this type of attack is not new, we have seen renewed
   Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks by email in the past few
   years via list-linking attacks, where the victim's email address is
   subscribed to thousands or even tens of thousands of mailing lists. We
   describe some of the measures that list owners and email service
   providers have suggested to mitigate such attacks. We then present a
   case study of a real-world attack, investigating whether characteristics
   of attack behavior and email attributes surface a workable hypothesis of
   early detection paradigms. We test our hypothesis on a dataset of
   hundreds of millions of emails, representing three months of data from
   3,000 medium and large organizations. Our technique helped us detect
   three previously unknown list-linking attacks in the dataset. We
   determined that anomalous bursts signify meaningful patterns at the user
   level, but cannot be extrapolated effectively when analyzing bulk
   enterprise volume data. Effective spam identification in this case needs
   to consider the unique nature of the messages in the attack, which lends
   to their exhibiting linguistic similarities, combined with their
   temporal proximity. We recommend a layered approach to detection and
   throttling through per-user volume and time-based methodologies paired
   with phrasal pattern recognition.},

Abstract = {We revisit the problem of entity authentication in decentralized
   end-to-end encrypted email and secure messaging to propose a practical
   and self-sustaining cryptographic solution based on
   password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE). This not only allows users
   to authenticate each other via shared low-entropy secrets, e.g.,
   memorable words, without a public key infrastructure or a trusted third
   party, but it also paves the way for automation and a series of
   cryptographic enhancements; improves security by minimizing the impact
   of human error and potentially improves usability. First, we study a few
   vulnerabilities in voice-based out-of-band authentication, in particular
   a combinatorial attack against lazy users, which we analyze in the
   context of a secure email solution. Next, we propose solving the problem
   of secure equality test using PAKE to achieve entity authentication and
   to establish a shared high-entropy secret key. Our solution lends itself
   to offline settings, compatible with the inherently asynchronous nature
   of email and modern messaging systems. The suggested approach enables
   enhancements in key management such as automated key renewal and future
   key pair authentications, multi-device synchronization, secure secret
   storage and retrieval, and the possibility of post-quantum security as
   well as facilitating forward secrecy and deniability in a primarily
   symmetric-key setting. We also discuss the use of auditable PAKEs for
   mitigating a class of online guess and abort attacks in authentication
   protocols.},

Abstract = {Recommender systems are nowadays widely used in e-commerce industry to
   boost its sale. One of the popular algorithms in recommender systems is
   collaborative filtering. The fundamental assumption behind this
   algorithm is that other users' opinions can be filtered and accumulated
   in such a way as to provide a plausible prediction of the target user's
   preference. In this paper, we would like to develop a recommender system
   with big data of one e-commerce company and deliver the recommendations
   through a personalized email. To address this problem, we propose
   user-based collaboration filter based on company dataset and employ
   several similarity functions: Euclidean distance, Cosine, Pearson
   correlation and Tanimoto coefficient. The experimental results show
   that: (i) user responses are positive to the given recommendations based
   on user perception survey (ii) Tanimoto coefficient with 10 neighbors
   shows the best performance in the RMSE, precision and recall evaluation
   based on groundtruth dataset.},

Abstract = {Email spam is continuously a major problem, especially on the Internet.
   Spam consists of malicious malwares which attack user's machine to steal
   information, destroy the user's machine and trick the user into buying
   their products. Although spam detection or email spam filtering was
   developed, there is still a rising number of emails that contain spam.
   The study of this research is to identify the potentially useful email
   header features for email spam detection by analyzing two (2) email
   datasets, the Anomaly Detection Challenges and Cyber Security Data
   Mining from website. By analyzing the datasets, the main objective of
   this research is to extract the suitable features of the email header
   and examine the features to classify the features using Support Vector
   Machine (SVM) using RapidMiner Studio and Weka 3.9.2. There are five (5)
   phases in the methodology which are Data Collection, data
   Pre-Processing, Features Selection, Classification and Detection.
   Classification of the email header using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   for CSDM2010 is higher than the Anomaly Detection Challenges datasets at
   88.80\% and 87.20\% respectively. Thus, SVM proves as a good classifier
   which produced above 80\% accuracy rate for both datasets.},

Abstract = {Phishing email has become a popular solution among attackers to steal
   all kinds of data from people and easily breach organizations' security
   system. Hackers use multiple techniques and tricks to raise the chances
   of success of their attacks, like using information found on social
   networking websites to tailor their emails to the target's interests, or
   targeting employees of an organization who probably can't spot a
   phishing email or malicious websites and avoid sending emails to IT
   people or employees from Security department. In this paper we focus on
   analyzing the coherence of information contained in the different parts
   of the email: Header, Body, and URLs. After analyzing multiple phishing
   emails we discovered that there is always incoherence between these
   different parts. We created a comprehensive method which uses a set of
   rules that correlates the information collected from analyzing the
   header, body and URLs of the email and can even include the user in the
   detection process. We take into account that there is no such thing
   called perfection, so even if an email is classified as legitimate, our
   system will still send a warning to the user if the email is suspicious
   enough. This way even if a phishing email manages to escape our system,
   the user can still be protected.},

Abstract = {Numerous studies of human user behaviours in cybersecurity tasks have
   used traditional research methods, such as self-reported surveys or
   empirical experiments, to identify relationships between various factors
   of interest and user security performance. This work takes a different
   approach, applying computational cognitive modelling to research the
   decision-making of cybersecurity users. The model described here relies
   on cognitive memory chunk activation to analytically simulate the
   decision-making process of a user classifying legitimate and phishing
   emails. Suspicious-seeming cues in each email are processed by examining
   similar, past classifications in long-term memory. We manipulate five
   parameters (Suspicion Threshold, Maximum Cues Processed, Weight of
   Similarity, Flawed Perception Level, Legitimate-to-Phishing Email Ratio
   in long-term memory) to examine their effects on accuracy, email
   processing time and decision confidence. Furthermore, we have conducted
   an empirical, unattended study of US participants performing the same
   task. Analyses on the empirical study data and simulation output,
   especially clustering analysis, show that these two research approaches
   complement each other for more insightful understanding of this phishing
   detection task. The analyses also demonstrate several limitations of
   this computational model that cannot easily capture certain user types
   and phishing detection strategies, calling for a more dynamic and
   sophisticated model construction.},

Abstract = {We propose a vehicular network trust model that integrates
   cryptography-based entity trust and email-based social trust. The entity
   trust provides security protections such as origin integrity, data
   integrity, and confidentiality. The social trust provides a level of
   belief on the data transmitted by an entity. To achieve the email-based
   social trust, we require each user to run an automated agent that
   performs trust evaluation checks and processes trust checking requests.
   The requests are from their highly trusted contacts or through a trusted
   proxy server maintained by the email service provider. We utilize
   identity-based cryptography (IBC) to integrate entity trust and social
   trust. This allows us to use a unique identity (e.g., an email address)
   for each entity. Further, we use the IBC based attribute based
   cryptography to develop secure group communications in vehicular
   networks. Finally, we present research challenges and potential research
   directions to extend this work.},

Abstract = {Many services in the internet including Email, search engine, social
   networking are provided with free of charge due to enormous growth of
   web users. With the expansion of web services, denial of service (DoS)
   attacks by malicious automated programs (e. g. web bots) is becoming a
   serious problem of web service accounts. In order to avoid tremendous
   attack from malicious computer programs, HIP, or Human Interactive
   Proofs has been introduced to distinguish humans from computers. HIPs
   are designed to be easy for humans but hard for machines. Unfortunately,
   the existing HIPs tried to maximize the difficulty for automated
   programs to pass tests by increasing distortion or noise. Consequently,
   it has also become difficult for potential users too. In our proposed
   technique we resolve this problem by making use of human cognitive
   processing abilities through emoticons focusing mainly on users.
   Features like language independence, using this for advertising purpose,
   ease of use interface for the touch-based smart-phone users, easy tuning
   of security and usability level make it very attractive to web service
   providers. In the result section, a microscopic large-scale user study
   was conducted involving 118 users to investigate the actual user views
   compare to existing state of the art CAPTCHA systems like ESP-PIX and
   Asirra in terms of usability and security and found our system can be
   solved with 88.04\% average success rate in less than 7 seconds.},

Title = {Towards a Hybrid Security Framework for Phishing Awareness Education and
   Defense},
Journal = {FUTURE INTERNET},
Year = {2024},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The rise in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to the
   development of more sophisticated phishing email attacks, as well as an
   increase in research on using AI to aid the detection of these advanced
   attacks. Successful phishing email attacks severely impact businesses,
   as employees are usually the vulnerable targets. Defense against such
   attacks, therefore, requires realizing defense along both technological
   and human vectors. Security hardening research work along the
   technological vector is few and focuses mainly on the use of machine
   learning and natural language processing to distinguish between machine-
   and human-generated text. Common existing approaches to harden security
   along the human vector consist of third-party organized training
   programmes, the content of which needs to be updated over time. There
   is, to date, no reported approach that provides both phishing attack
   detection and progressive end-user training. In this paper, we present
   our contribution, which includes the design and development of an
   integrated approach that employs AI-assisted and generative AI platforms
   for phishing attack detection and continuous end-user education in a
   hybrid security framework. This framework supports scenario-customizable
   and evolving user education in dealing with increasingly advanced
   phishing email attacks. The technological design and functional details
   for both platforms are presented and discussed. Performance tests showed
   that the phishing attack detection sub-system using the Convolutional
   Neural Network (CNN) deep learning model architecture achieved the best
   overall results: above 94\% accuracy, above 95\% precision, and above
   94\% recall.},

Abstract = {The various forms and tremendous number of spam emails have brought
   great challenges to accurate email classification. In this paper, we
   present a behavior- and time-feature-based email classification method.
   Based on email logs, email social networks are built through the
   extraction of entities and relations from the email records using the
   MapReduce model. By combining behavior features from social networks and
   time features from email sending intervals, we adopt a Support Vector
   Machine based classifier to identify spammers and non-spammers. Compared
   with the current email classification methods, the advantages of our
   method are: (1) in addition to the behavior-based features, our method
   integrates the time feature to facilitate email classification; (2) to
   efficiently handle the vast number of emails, we employ the MapReduce
   model to extract the behavior- and time-based features on the email
   social network. Experiments on real email data of three years show that
   the proposed method achieves better classification accuracy.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we conducted a survey of 206 smartphone users of
   different demographics in Japan and Tanzania, two countries with
   different security and privacy expectations, to analyse users'
   cybersecurity knowledge and attitudes. We studied password choices,
   smartphone lock behaviour, phishing awareness and attitudes towards
   public Wi-Fi. We also assessed the acceptability of our novel
   notification alert for smartphone OS security updates. We found that
   data privacy is equally important to the majority of participants, 70\%,
   in both countries. However, most participants did not know the
   characteristics of a strong password for web applications despite being
   highly conscious of physical access security which was characterised by
   smartphone locking (78\% of participants). We also found that phishing
   awareness in Tanzania is not satisfactory, with the majority of the
   participants, 78\%, likely to open a link from an unknown email source,
   whereas in Japan only 32\% are likely to do so. Participants in Japan
   were also slightly more likely to read terms and conditions when
   connecting to public Wi-Fi (36\% vs. 27\%). Our novel notification
   design which integrated security updates with other free information
   services seemed promising for increasing security awareness and update
   compliance. Participants were more willing to accept update notices that
   provided guidance on how-to to perform a required task than plain
   notices.},

Abstract = {Certified email is a system which enables a sender to prove a receiver's
   receipt of email. Such a system can be used for applications related to
   electronic commerce on the Internet. This paper considers a situation
   where a sender or a receiver wants to change his/her mind due to the
   change of mail content value (e.g., stock, auction, gambling) during the
   transaction. We point out that no traditional certified email systems
   have been designed for such a case, thus one of the participants can be
   at a disadvantage. To avoid this problem, we propose an evenhanded
   certified email system in which each participant can change his/her
   choice, either cancel or finish the transaction, at any time during the
   transaction.},

Abstract = {Email and other forms of electronic communication are becoming
   increasingly more essential to our everyday lives. However, with this
   growth comes the paralleled increased risk of email harassment,
   exacerbated by the current lack of platform support for managing these
   harmful messages. This paper explores diferent interfaces for the
   automated detection and management of email harassment using artifcial
   intelligence in order to investigate what degree of platform
   intervention email users prefer when navigating their email platform.
   Through conducting a study involving three diferent email platform
   prototypes based on the Gmail platform, we evaluate how varying levels
   of platform intervention afect users' perceived sense of safety, agency,
   and trust with their email platform. Our primary fndings suggest that
   users generally benefted from each of the system intervention strategies
   and desired higher intervention features when combating email
   harassment, as well as ways of managing this intervention based on their
   unique preferences.},

Abstract = {Email has become an essential service for global communication. In email
   protocols, a Delegation Mechanism allows emails to be sent by other
   entities on behalf of the email author. Specifically, the Sender field
   indicates the agent for email delivery (i.e., the Delegate). Despite
   well-implemented security extensions (e.g., DKIM, DMARC) that validate
   the authenticity of email authors, vulnerabilities in the Delegation
   Mechanism can still be exploited to bypass these security measures with
   well-crafted spoofing emails.
   This paper systematically analyzes the security vulnerabilities within
   the Delegation Mechanism. Due to the absence of validation for the
   Sender field, adversaries can arbitrarily fabricate this field, thus
   spoofing the Delegate presented to email recipients. Our observations
   reveal that emails with a spoofed Sender field can pass authentications
   and reach the inboxes of all target providers. We also conduct a user
   study with 50 participants to assess the recipients' comprehension of
   spoofed Delegates, finding that 50\% are susceptible to deceiving
   Delegate information. Furthermore, we propose novel email spoofing
   attacks where adversaries can impersonate arbitrary entities as email
   authors to craft highly deceptive emails while passing security
   extensions. We assess their impact across 16 service providers and 20
   clients, observing that half of the providers and all clients are
   vulnerable to the discovered attacks. To mitigate the threats within the
   Delegation Mechanism, we propose a validation scheme to verify the
   authenticity of the Sender field, along with design suggestions to
   enhance the security of email clients.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to identify, in primary articles, the unintentional
   risk behaviors of users in digital environments through a Systematic
   Mapping Study (SMS). The methodology involved defining research
   questions based on PICO criteria and creating a search string that
   encompassed the essential terms of the study. Three databases (CAPES,
   SciELO, and Scopus) were selected and used to search for articles that
   met the established inclusion criteria. The selected studies addressed
   various user groups, from students to professionals in different fields,
   highlighting the universality of digital security challenges. The most
   commonly used data collection methods were questionnaires and
   observation, enabling a comprehensive understanding of users' risky
   habits. The results highlighted a variety of risk behaviors, including
   password sharing, neglecting email attachment verification, sharing
   unnecessary information, and not locking the computer when away. Thus,
   it is expected that this study will contribute to initiatives and
   research aimed at improving awareness and habits in the digital
   environment, fostering the creation of more efficient policies, and
   prompting reflection on data security among users.},

Abstract = {Counting-based secret-sharing (CBSS) is a current cybersecurity
   technique that provide applicable authentication for multi-participants
   collaborative trust access control utilization. The CBSS originally
   assigns its main confidential target key as secret random automatically
   selected to generate all participants private shares fulfilling
   trap-door function. CBSS is normally not allowing to entertain user
   preference in personalizing the passwords causing severe remembrance
   reliability difficulty. This research addressed this retention
   personalized challenge by adjusting the CBSS procedure commencing its
   process by user password selection choice, as for secret shares
   extraction to generate the target-key, securing the cybersecurity
   collaborative system. We proposed several algorithms for user-preference
   secret shares combination based on text and images alternatives, further
   verified by personal email convenience authentication. The proposals
   tested this adjusted CBSS reliability comparing overall security,

Journal = {IADIS-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Pages = {93-108},
Abstract = {Spear phishing emails pose great danger to employees of organizations
   due to the inherent weakness of the employees in identifying the threat
   from spear phishing cues, as well as the spear phisher's skill in
   crafting contextually convincing emails. This raises the main question
   of which construct (user vulnerabilities or phisher skills) has a
   greater influence on the vulnerable user. Researchers have provided
   enough evidence of user vulnerabilities, namely the desire for monetary
   gain, curiosity of the computer user, carelessness on the part of the
   user, the trust placed in the purported sender by the user, and a lack
   of awareness on the part of the computer user. However, there is a lack
   of research on the magnitude of each of these factors in influencing an
   unsuspecting user to fall for a phishing or spear phishing attack which
   we explored in this paper. While user vulnerabilities pose major risk,
   the effect of the spear phisher's ability in skillfully crafting
   convincing emails (using fear appeals, urgency of action, and email
   contextualization) to trap even skillful IT security personnel is an
   area that needs to be explored. Therefore, we explored the relationships
   between the two major constructs namely `user vulnerabilities' and
   `email contextualization', through the theory of planned behavior with
   the objective to find out the major factors that lead to computer users
   biting the phishers' bait. In this theoretical version of the paper, we
   provided the resulting two constructs that needed to be tested.},

Abstract = {Social business has improved the ability of managers and stakeholders

   provide insufficient practice for information protection while

   development of an Optimized Hybrid Security Model using Base 64
   Algorithm and Substitution in Conjunction to enhance message security.
   This research is a prototype for the user input of message and security
   key in Hypertext Preprocessor using JQuery. The developed system needs
   the input of the plain text and the security key. Initially, Base 64
   algorithm encrypts plain text into cypher text with the security key and
   then the Substitution Cipher encrypts the key into a cypher secured key.
   For testing, 300 text messages were input with different security keys.
   This research is a step forward in securing text messages; it can be
   used to encrypt text between sender and receiver through email, or it
   can be applied on instant messaging services and also can be used for

Abstract = {Email is an essential tool for communication and social interaction. It
   also functions as a broadcast medium connecting businesses with their
   customers, as an authentication mechanism, and as a vector for scams and
   security threats. These uses are enabled by the fact that the only
   barrier to reaching someone by email is knowing his or her email
   address. This feature has given rise to the spam email industry but also
   has another side-effect that is becoming increasingly common:
   misdirected email, or legitimate emails that are intended for somebody
   else but are sent to the wrong recipient. In this paper we present
   findings from an interview study and survey focusing on characteristics
   of misdirected email messages, possible reasons why they happen, and how
   people manage these messages when they receive them. Misdirected email
   arises as a result of signifiers (usernames) which were selected by
   people for social and self-representation purposes, that are also used
   by machines for addressing. Because there is no mechanism for dealing
   with misdirected emails in a systematic way, individual recipients must
   choose whether to take action and how much effort to put forth to
   prevent potential negative consequences for themselves and others.},

Abstract = {A wrapper has been developed that monitors the run-time behavior of
   opened email attachments to ensure that these processes don't do
   anything harmful. The wrapper detects violations of process-specific
   rules establishing the acceptable (and safe) behavior of these processes
   relative to four resources: the file system, the system registry,
   inter-host communication, and process spawning.
   The wrapper can determine whether an operation is being performed by the
   native application or by active content within the email attachment and
   applies a different (and presumably more stringent) set of rules to the
   latter.
   When attempted violations are detected, the user is notified and
   informed of the severity of the violation. The user determines whether
   to allow or prohibit the offending operation. The violation, the user's
   response, and the initiating email and attachment - obtained from the
   email client - are logged.},

Title = {Privacy vs usability: A qualitative exploration of patients' experiences
   with secure Internet communication with their general practitioner},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {7},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Direct electronic communication between patients and
   physicians has the potential to empower patients and improve health care
   services. Communication by regular email is, however, considered a
   security threat in many countries and is not recommended. Systems which
   offer secure communication have now emerged. Unlike regular email,
   secure systems require that users authenticate themselves. However, the
   authentication steps per se may become barriers that reduce use.
   Objectives: The objective was to study the experiences of patients who
   were using a secure electronic communication system. The focus of the
   study was the users' privacy versus the usability of the system.
   Methods: Qualitative interviews were conducted with 15 patients who used
   a secure communication system (MedAxess) to exchange personal health
   information with their primary care physician.
   Results: Six main themes were identified from the interviews: (1)
   supporting simple questions, (2) security issues, (3) aspects of written
   communication, (4) trust in the physician, (5) simplicity of MedAxess,
   and (6) trouble using the system. By using the system, about half of the
   patients (8/15) experienced easier access to their physician, with whom
   they tended to solve minor health problems and elaborate on more complex
   illness experiences. Two thirds of the respondents (10/15) found that
   their physician quickly responded to their MedAxess requests. As a
   result of the security barriers, the users felt that the system was
   secure. However, due to the same barriers, the patients considered the
   log-in procedure cumbersome, which had considerable negative impact on
   the actual use of the system.
   Conclusions: Despite a perceived need for secure electronic
   patient-physician communication systems, security barriers may diminish
   their overall usefulness. A dual approach is necessary to improve this
   situation: patients need to be better informed about security issues,
   and, at the same time, their experiences of using secure systems must be
   studied and used to improve user interfaces.},

Abstract = {Understanding malware behavior will help in implementing robust
   intrusion detection and prevention systems. In this paper, we studied
   the behavioral characteristics of different mal ware types affecting the
   Internet and other enterprise email systems. This research was carried
   out on spam email data received by a single user's test email account
   collected over a period of six months. A sandbox test environment
   platform using virtual machines was built to perform this research and
   simulate real-life malware behavior and determine its signature at the
   point of execution for proper analysis. Analysis of email data using the
   sandbox setup helps to produce a comprehensive data analysis about
   botnet behavior. We described in detail the design and implementation of
   sandbox test environment including the challenges faced in building this
   test environment. As a cost saving measure, we used VMware based virtual
   platforms built on Linux PC-class hardware. We present results of our
   behavioral measurement of the most active botnets. Our study discovered
   that for a single email user for a period of six months, two active
   Trojans contributed around 20 percent of the total identified malwares
   received within this time period and the remaining 80 percent of malware
   binaries were distributed over many different types of botnets; the
   email malware shows a classic long-tail distribution. During this
   experiment, we also discovered very strong polymorphic behaviors
   exhibited by these malware samples, ostensibly intended to help the
   malware authors and hackers to penetrate and bypass the enterprise
   intrusion detection systems. Finally, we are releasing the repository of
   malware collected as a data set for evaluation by other researchers.},

Abstract = {In the current global scenario, the prime question in every woman's mind
   is about her safety and security. The only thought haunting every women
   is when they will be able to move freely on the streets even in odd
   hours without worrying about their security. This work suggests a new
   perspective to use technology to protect women. The wearable system
   resembles a normal watch with a button. Women can press the button when
   they feel discomfort and activate the system. The system can also be
   activated by changes in sensor setup output which is part of the system.
   When activated, the system tracks the location of the woman using Global
   Positioning System (GPS) sensor and sends an emergency email to the
   person who can help or save her. The system also incorporates a
   screaming alarm that uses real-time clock, to call out for help. The
   main advantage of this system is that the user does not require a
   smartphone unlike other applications that have been developed earlier.
   The use of sophisticated components ensures accuracy of the system and
   makes it reliable. Uneven terrains, step fields, sand and gravel, as
   well as exploring tasks like finding the injured victims and hazardous
   signs.},

Abstract = {Email-based attacks, such as Business Email Compromise, seriously
   threaten many organizations. In recent years, Large Language Models have
   improved the potency of email-based attacks by giving attackers an
   easy-to-use tool to overcome the language barrier and craft believable
   emails. At the same time, Business Email Compromise research remains
   hamstrung by the lack of a publicly available dataset. This paper
   proposes a novel system composed of Large Language Models to create
   Business Email Compromise datasets. Two datasets are generated. The
   first one (BEC-1) is a small 20-email proof-of-concept dataset that
   demonstrates that the system produces a dataset that a human analyst
   finds credible. The second (BEC-2) is a larger 279-email dataset
   generated using the same system. BEC-2 is the first public Business
   Email Compromise dataset available to the email security research
   community. The paper also proposes an accuracy-like metric called
   ``agreement score{''} to measure the quality of datasets produced. Both
   BEC-1 and BEC-2 have high agreement scores - 90 and 93, respectively -
   validating the effectiveness of the Large Language Model system.},

Abstract = {Phishing is fundamental to cyber attacks. This research determined the
   effect of Internet user age and email content such as weapons of
   influence (persuasive techniques that attackers can use to lure
   individuals to fall for an attack) and life domains (a specific topic or
   aspect of an individual's life that attackers can focus an email on) on
   spear-phishing (targeted phishing) susceptibility. In total, 100 young
   and 58 older users received, without their knowledge, daily simulated
   phishing emails over 21 days. A browser plugin recorded their clicking
   on links in the emails as an indicator of their susceptibility.
   Forty-three percent of users fell for the simulated phishing emails,
   with older women showing the highest susceptibility. While
   susceptibility in young users declined across the study, susceptibility
   in older users remained stable. The relative effectiveness of the
   attacks differed by weapons of influence and life domains with age-group
   variability. In addition, older compared to young users reported lower
   susceptibility awareness. These findings support effects of Internet
   user demographics and email content on susceptibility to phishing and
   emphasize the need for personalization of the next generation of

Abstract = {The increasing frequency of security incidents is a major concern to
   organizations, and it is therefore important for organizations to
   protect themselves against security threats. Technological controls are
   important but not adequate, as the success of security also depends on
   the effective security behavior of individuals. Information security
   awareness programs are an important approach but such programs have to
   be effective in influencing user's behavior. It is thus important to
   investigate the factors that will influence a user to practice computer
   security in the context of an organization. With such motivation in mind
   this study uses the Health Belief Model, a well-established model from
   preventive healthcare, to study users' computer security behavior. An
   instrument was developed based on health and security literature and
   conceptually validated. Data was collected from 134 employees of
   different organizations and analyzed using multiple regression analysis.
   Results show that perceived susceptibility. perceived benefits and
   self-efficacy are determinants of a user's computer security behavior
   when applied to exercising care with email attachments. Theoretical and
   practical implications of this study are discussed},

Abstract = {OpenPGP is one of the two major standards for end-to-end email security.
   Several studies showed that serious usability issues exist with tools
   implementing this standard. However, a widespread assumption is that
   expert users can handle these tools and detect signature spoofing
   attacks. We present a user study investigating expert users' strategies
   to detect signature spoofing attacks in Thunderbird. We observed 25
   expert users while they classified eight emails as either having a
   legitimate signature or not. Studying expert users explicitly gives us
   an upper bound of attack detection rates of all users dealing with PGP
   signatures. 52\% of participants fell for at least one out of four
   signature spoofing attacks. Overall, participants did not have an
   established strategy for evaluating email signature legitimacy. We
   observed our participants apply 23 different types of checks when
   inspecting signed emails, but only 8 of these checks tended to be useful
   in identifying the spoofed or invalid signatures. In performing their
   checks, participants were frequently startled, confused, or annoyed with
   the user interface, which they found supported them little. All these
   results paint a clear picture: Even expert users struggle to verify
   email signatures, usability issues in email security are not limited to
   novice users, and developers may need proper guidance on implementing
   email signature GUIs correctly.},

Abstract = {Spam turns out to be an increasingly serious problem to email users. A
   number of anti-spam schemes have been proposed and deployed, but the
   problem has yet been well addressed. One of those schemes is
   challenge-response, in which a challenge is imposed on an email sender.
   However, such a scheme introduces new problems for the users, e.g.,
   delay of service and denial of service attacks. In this paper, we
   introduce a pre-challenge scheme that avoids those problems. It assumes
   each user has a challenge that is defined by the user himself/herself
   and associated with his/her email address, in such a way that an email
   sender can simultaneously retrieve a new receiver's email address and
   challenge before sending an email in the first contact. Some new
   mechanisms are employed to reach a good balance between security against
   spam and convenience to email users.},

Abstract = {The damage due to computer security incidents is motivating
   organizations to adopt protective mechanisms. While technological
   controls are necessary, computer security also depends on individual's
   security behavior. It is thus important to investigate what influences a
   user to practice computer security. This study uses the Health Belief
   Model. adapted from the healthcare literature, to study users' computer
   security behavior. The model was validated using survey data from 134
   employees. Results show that perceived susceptibility, perceived
   benefits. and self-efficacy are determinants of email related security
   behavior. Perceived severity moderates the effects of perceived
   benefits, general security orientation, cues to action, and
   self-efficacy on security behavior. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {This paper proposes a novel email author verification aimed at tackling
   email spoofing attacks. The proposed approach exploits an authorship
   technique based on the analysis of the author's writing style. The
   problem has been studied under two viewpoints, i.e. the typical sender
   verification viewpoint, already exploited in previous works, and the
   sender-receiver interaction verification, which to the best of our
   knowledge is a novel approach. Hence, we introduced the concept of
   end-to-end email authorship verification, which is focused on the
   analysis of the sender-receiver interactions. The proposed method
   implements a binary classification exploiting both standard machine
   learning classifiers based on the well-known text stylometric features
   and deep learning classifiers based on the automatic feature extraction
   phase. We have used a well-known email dataset, i.e. the Enron dataset
   to benchmark our approach, with the experiments showing an authorship
   verification accuracy reaching 99\% and 93\% respectively for the sender
   and the end to end verification scenarios. The proposed method has been
   implemented as an end-user support system in the Android environment for
   email spoofing attack detection.},

Abstract = {Account recovery (usually through a password reset) on many websites has
   mainly relied on accessibility to a registered email due to its
   favorable deployability and usability. However, it makes a user's online
   accounts vulnerable to a single point of failure when the registered
   email account is compromised. While previous research focuses on
   strengthening user passwords, the security risk imposed by email-based
   account recovery has not yet been well studied. In this paper, we
   investigate the possibility of mounting an email-based account recovery
   attack. Specifically, we examine the account authentication and recovery
   protocols in 239 traffic-heavy websites, confirming that most of them
   use emails for account recovery. We further scrutinize the security
   policy of major email service providers and show that a significant
   portion of them take no or marginal effort to protect user email
   accounts, leaving compromised email accounts readily available for
   mounting account recovery attacks. Then, we conduct case studies to
   assess potential losses caused by such attacks. Finally, we propose a
   lightweight email security enhancement called Secure Email Account
   Recovery (SEAR) to defend against account recovery attacks as an extra
   layer of protection to account recovery emails.},

Abstract = {Although email worms have been around for several years, they continue
   to be a major Internet security threat to network operators and end
   users. Their high incidence and the damage they cause reveal that
   conventional network protection systems are inherently incapable of
   reducing the frequency and impact of email worm outbreaks. In this
   paper, we study the effect of email worms on the flow-level
   characteristics of the Domain Name System (DNS) query streams that user
   machines generate. We present a method that uses unsupervised learning
   and wavelet-based time series analysis to distinguish between
   non-infected and email worm-infected user machines on the local name
   servers. We evaluate the proposed method against a DNS query dataset
   that consists of 71 email worms, and demonstrate that it is remarkably
   effective.},

Abstract = {Phishing and spear phishing are typical examples of masquerade attacks
   since trust is built up through impersonation for the attack to succeed.
   Given the prevalence of these attacks, considerable research has been
   conducted on these problems along multiple dimensions. We reexamine the
   existing research on phishing and spear phishing from the perspective of
   the unique needs of the security domain, which we call security
   challenges: real-time detection, active attacker, dataset quality and
   base-rate fallacy. We explain these challenges and then survey the
   existing phishing/spear phishing solutions in their light. This
   viewpoint consolidates the literature and illuminates several
   opportunities for improving existing solutions. We organize the existing
   literature based on detection techniques for different attack vectors
   (e.g., URLs, websites, emails) along with studies on user awareness. For
   detection techniques we examine properties of the dataset, feature
   extraction, detection algorithms used, and performance evaluation
   metrics. This work can help guide the development of more effective
   defenses for phishing, spear phishing and email masquerade attacks of
   the future, as well as provide a framework for a thorough evaluation and
   comparison.},

Abstract = {Email clients supporting encryption and signature are mostly based on
   the PKI (public key infrastructure) system, and users need their own
   digital certificates to send secure mails. This leads to a series of
   complicated operation problems with digital certificates. IBC
   (Identity-based cryptography) is an asymmetric algorithm, with the
   user's unique identity information and a set of public parameters
   combined as a public key. It avoids the problems with PKI and is a good
   substitute for PKI. However, current standard applications including
   email clients do not support IBC algorithm. In this work, we use
   pseudo-RSA digital certificate technology to bridge the gap. The
   technology stores an IBC key in an RSA certificate structure, generates
   secure email in SMIME format, making the resulted email compatible with
   SMIME enabled software. The focus of this work is on secure web email.
   To achieve cross-platform applicability, non-plug-ins technology is
   employed for the proposed secure web email system.},

Abstract = {The goal of email classification is to classify user emails into spam
   and legitimate ones. Many supervised learning algorithms have been
   invented in this domain to accomplish the task, and these algorithms
   require a large number of labeled training data. However, data labeling
   is a labor intensive task and requires in-depth domain knowledge. Thus,
   only a very small proportion of the data can be labeled in practice.
   This bottleneck greatly degrades the effectiveness of supervised email
   classification systems. In order to address this problem, in this work,
   we first identify some critical issues regarding supervised machine
   learning-based email classification. Then we propose an effective
   classification model based on multi-view disagreement-based
   semi-supervised learning. The motivation behind the attempt of using
   multi-view and semi-supervised learning is that multi-view can provide
   richer information for classification, which is often ignored by
   literature, and semi-supervised learning supplies with the capability of
   coping with labeled and unlabeled data. In the evaluation, we
   demonstrate that the multi-view data can improve the email
   classification than using a single view data, and that the proposed
   model working with our algorithm can achieve better performance as
   compared to the existing similar algorithms.},

Abstract = {Spear phishing has been a persistent threat to users and organizations,
   and yet email providers still face key challenges to authenticate
   incoming emails. As a result, attackers can apply spoofing techniques to
   impersonate a trusted entity to conduct highly deceptive phishing
   attacks. In this work, we study email spoofing to answer three key
   questions: (1) How do email providers detect and handle forged emails?
   (2) Under what conditions can forged emails penetrate the defense to
   reach user inbox? (3) Once the forged email gets in, how email providers
   warn users? Is the warning truly effective?
   We answer these questions by conducting an end-toend measurement on 35
   popular email providers and examining user reactions to spoofing through
   a real-world spoofing/phishing test. Our key findings are three folds.
   First, we observe that most email providers have the necessary protocols
   to detect spoofing, but still allow forged emails to reach the user
   inbox (e.g., Yahoo Mail, iCloud, Gmail). Second, once a forged email
   gets in, most email providers have no warning for users, particularly
   for mobile email apps. Some providers (e.g., Gmail Inbox) even have
   misleading UIs that make the forged email look authentic. Third, a few
   email providers (9/35) have implemented visual security indicators on
   unverified emails. Our phishing experiment shows that security
   indicators have a positive impact on reducing risky user actions, but
   cannot eliminate the risk. Our study reveals a major miscommunication
   between email providers and end-users. Improvements at both ends
   (server-side protocols and UIs) are needed to bridge the gap.},

Abstract = {MUA (Mail User Agent) programs support email encryption functionality
   for providing confidentiality of the email contents. They encrypt email
   contents using email encryption standards such as OpenPGP or S/MIME,
   mostly implemented by GnuPG, or GPG in practice. In order to understand
   security implication of the structures and analyze any possible
   vulnerabilities of MUA programs, in this paper, we investigated
   practical MUAs supporting e-mail encryption. As a result, we found
   severe vulnerabilities in a list of MUAs that allow cache side-channel
   attacks in virtualized desktop environments. Our analysis reveals that
   the root cause originates from the lack of verification and control over
   third-party cryptographic libraries they adopt. In order to substantiate
   the importance of the vulnerability we found, we delivered FLUSH+RELOAD
   attack on those MUA programs and demonstrated that the attack restores
   92\% of the RSA private keys when recipients read a single encrypted
   email.},

Abstract = {Email encryption tools remain underused, even by people who frequently
   conduct sensitive business over email, such as lawyers and journalists.
   Usable encrypted email has remained out of reach largely because key
   management and verification remain difficult. However, key management
   has evolved in the age of social media: Keybase is a service that allows
   users to cryptographically link public keys to their social media
   accounts (e.g., Twitter), enabling key trust without out-of-band
   communication. We design and prototype Confidante, an encrypted email
   client that uses Keybase for automatic key management. We conduct a user
   study with 15 people (8 U.S. lawyers and 7 U.S. journalists) to evaluate
   Confidante's design decisions. We find that users complete an encrypted
   email task more quickly and with fewer errors using Confidante than with
   an existing email encryption tool, and that many users report finding
   Confidante comparable to using ordinary email. However, we also find
   that lawyers and journalists have diverse operational constraints and
   threat models, and thus that there may not be a one-size-fits-all
   solution to usable encrypted email. We reflect on our findings-both
   specifically about Confidante and more generally about the needs and
   constraints of lawyers and journalists-to identify lessons and remaining
   security and usability challenges for encrypted email.},

Abstract = {In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of deep-learning-based
   password guessing models for targeted attacks on human-chosen passwords.
   In recent years, service providers have increased the level of security
   of users' passwords. This is done by requiring more complex password
   generation patterns and by using computationally expensive hash
   functions. For the attackers this means a reduced number of available
   guessing attempts, which introduces the necessity to target their guess
   by exploiting a victim's publicly available information. In this work,
   we introduce a contextaware password guessing model that better capture
   attackers' behavior. We demonstrate that knowing a victim's email
   address is already critical in compromising the associated password and
   provide an in-depth analysis of the relationship between them. We also
   show the potential of such models to identify clusters of users based on
   their password generation behaviour, which can spot fake profiles and
   populations more vulnerable to context-aware guesses. The code is
   publicly available at https://github.com/spring-epfl/DCM\_sp.},

Abstract = {Phishing over email continues to be a significant threat, as such
   messages still end up in users' inboxes. Several studies showed that
   users rarely check the URL in the statusbar before clicking a link and
   that they have difficulties reading URLs. To support users, we propose
   SMILE (Smart eMaIl Link domain Extractor), a novel approach that
   provides the relevant information to distinguish between legitimate and
   phishing emails checking the links in them. Once applied, SMILE modifies
   all links in an email to contain the domain and top-level-domain of the
   URL behind them, e.g., ``Click here{''} in an legitimate Amazon email is
   modified to ``Click here {[}amazon.com]{''}.},

Abstract = {Electronic mail (or email) has not just changed the way we communicate
   in our daily life; it has transformed the way we do business today.
   Considered a convenient, powerful and a low cost tool, it is widely used
   to convey all kind of information including -unfortunately - sensitive
   or confidential information such as passwords, personal data, and
   private information. In recent times, two emerging technologies,
   referred to as the cloud computing and browser-based email technologies,
   have gained popularity among users and, along the way, also added a new
   significant layer of risk: It is common practice now from users to store
   their passwords into email folders and even worse, most of those
   browsers store and remember your password to open your email account
   automatically. Let's imagine the consequences of an attack launched by
   cybercriminals designed to resend and divert the original
   functionalities and features inherent to the browser for any malicious
   purpose, or worse - terrorist attempts. Let's take for example a US
   military officer operating in a country at war such as Afghanistan
   simply sending emails to his family to keep in touch with them. Whenever
   he sends an email, thousands of emails containing racial slurs against
   Muslim people are automatically sent to Afghan troops from his web
   account without him knowing it. The consequences of such an action would
   be unquestionably devastating. This above example, though fictitious,
   illustrates how efficient this kind of emails could be for both war
   propaganda and deception operations against US troops. Now imagine a
   company `s decision maker who daily exchanges large amounts of emails
   containing sensitive or confidential information within and outside his
   company ranging from trade secrets, contracts details, customer lists,
   research reports, financial information to staff's personal details.
   Modifying the browser-based email technology could enable any
   ill-intended person to wiretap and to eavesdrop any email directly at
   the browser's level to record any sent data and to make them evade from
   the computer towards unscrupulous people. The collection of the daily
   flow of emails, both internally and externally, definitely provides a
   snapshot of a company's overall culture and is proving to be a powerful
   and efficient tool used for both industrial and economic espionage. As a
   last example, these technologies once modified, could be used to set up
   thousand of zombies in mail clients. For that purpose, a large number of
   email clients would simultaneously send thousands of mails to a single
   target - e.g. an email server - to deny mail service for a limited
   period of time. We can easily imagine that this kind of attack launched
   on any stock exchange computer systems would entail damaging economic
   repercussions for the affected country and would probably plunge it into
   chaos for some time. In this paper, we will explain and show that email
   can be used as a ideal weapon for terrorism, cyber warfare, espionage,
   denial of service and can cripple all sectors of economy and nation
   states. We will address these issues both at the technical and
   operational level. In any case, we have considered systems with the most
   restricted user's privileges, but making those attacks really easy and
   powerful.},

Abstract = {With the wide spread use of Internet, comes an increase in Information
   Security threats. To protect against these threats, technology alone
   have been found not enough as it can be misused by users and become
   vulnerable to various threats, thus, losing its usefulness. This is
   evident as users tend to use weak passwords, open email attachments
   without checking and do not set correct security settings. However,
   especially with the continuously evolving threat landscape, one cannot
   assume that users are always motivated to learn about Information
   Security and practice it. Actually, there are situations of an aware
   user who knows how to protect himself but, simply, chooses not to,
   because they do not care, usability problems or because they do not
   consider themselves as targets. Thus, understanding human security
   behavior is vital for ensuring an efficient Information Security
   environment that cannot depend on technology only. Although a number of
   psychological theories and models, such as Protection Motivation Theory
   and Technology Acceptance Model, were used in the literature to
   interpret these behaviors, they tend to assess users' intensions rather
   than actual behavior. The aim of this paper is to understand and assess
   these behaviors from a holistic view by finding the significant factors
   that influence them and how to best assist users to protect themselves.
   To accomplish this, a systematic literature review was conducted where
   relevant literature was sought in a number of academic digital
   databases. As a result, several key behavioral influencers were
   identified to be essential to consider when educating and directing
   users' security behavior. Further to that, a number of Information
   Security awareness approaches were proposed that may transform the user
   from being ill-informed into a securityminded user who is able to make
   an informed decision.},

Abstract = {Recently, many users have been attacked by phishing or targeted
   malicious email, and thus email has become completely untrustworthy. So
   we gradually need to make email communications more secure. Of course,
   we can digitally sign, encrypt and decrypt emails by secure email
   systems such as S/MIME and PGP, which are two standards developed for
   that purpose. However, these two systems are seldom used and then have
   some drawbacks: the trust mode of PGP is only suitable for small-scaled
   organizations, and S/MIME cannot run away from the troubling operations
   such as the certificate application. In this paper, we propose a
   decentralized and large-scaled secure email system using conventional
   RSA signature embedding ID (e.g., email address), which is used in the
   communication scene among unspecified multi-organization. More
   importantly, our system needs neither a public key certificate nor
   voucher (e.g., CA or trusted user) for mail security by employing the
   new type of ``key trust level{''}. Since the reliability of email is
   decided by user itself rather than is decided by other vouchers, we can
   say that our system is truly decentralized.},

Abstract = {Smartphone becomes one of the most popular devices in last few years due
   to the integration of powerful technologies in it. Now-a-days a
   smartphone can provide different services as like as a computer
   provides. Smartphone holds our important personal information such as
   photos and videos, SMS, email, contact list, social media accounts etc.
   Therefore, the number of security and privacy related threats are also
   increasing relatively. Our research aims at evaluating how much the
   smartphone users are aware about their security and privacy. In this
   study, firstly we have taken a survey for smartphone users to access the
   level of smartphone security awareness displayed by the public. We also
   determine whether a general level of security complacency exists among
   smartphone users and measure the awareness of android users regarding
   their privacy. From survey result we have found that, most of the people
   are not aware about their smartphone security and privacy. Secondly,
   based on survey results, we have shown a method to measure the level of
   awareness (LOA) for the smartphone users. By using this method, a user
   can easily measure his/her smartphone security and privacy related level
   of awareness.},

Abstract = {Spamming and Phishing attacks are the most common security challenges we
   face in today's cyber world. The existing methods for the Spam and
   Phishing detection are based on blacklisting and heuristics technique.
   These methods require human intervention to update if any new Spam and
   Phishing activity occurs. Moreover, these are completely inefficient in
   detecting new Spam and Phishing activities. These techniques can detect
   malicious activity only after the attack has occurred. Machine learning
   has the capability to detect new Spam and Phishing activities. This
   requires extensive domain knowledge for feature learning and feature
   representation. Deep learning is a method of machine learning which has
   the capability to extract optimal feature representation from various
   samples of benign, Spam and Phishing activities by itself. To leverage,
   this work uses various deep learning architectures for both Spam and
   Phishing detection with electronic mail (Email) and uniform resource
   locator (URL) data sources. Because in recent years both Email and URL
   resources are the most commonly used by the attackers to spread malware.
   Various datasets are used for conducting experiments with deep learning
   architectures. For comparative study, classical machine learning
   algorithms are used. These datasets are collected using public and
   private data sources. All experiments are run till 1,000 epochs with
   varied learning rate 0.01-0.5. For comparative study various classical
   machine learning classifiers are used with domain level feature
   extraction. For deep learning architectures and classical machine
   learning algorithms to convert text data into numeric representation
   various natural language processing text representation methods are
   used. As far as anyone is concerned, this is the first attempt, a
   framework that can examine and connect the occasions of Spam and
   Phishing activities from Email and URL sources at scale to give cyber
   threat situational awareness. The created framework is exceptionally
   versatile and fit for distinguishing the malicious activities in close
   constant. In addition, the framework can be effectively reached out to
   deal with vast volume of other cyber security events by including extra
   resources. These qualities havemade the proposed framework emerge from
   some other arrangement of comparative kind.},

Abstract = {``Phishing emails{''} are phishing emails with illegal links that direct
   users to pages of some real websites that are spoofed, or pages where
   real HTML has been inserted with dangerous HTML code, so as to deceive
   users' private information such as bank or credit card account numbers,
   email account numbers, and passwords. People are the most vulnerable
   part of security. Phishing emails use human weaknesses to attack. This
   article describes the application of the principle of persuasion in
   phishing emails, and based on the existing methods, this paper proposes
   a phishing email detection method based on the persuasion principle. The
   principle of persuasion principle is to count whether the corresponding
   word of the feature appears in the mail. The feature is selected using
   an information gain algorithm, and finally 25 features are selected for
   detection. Finally experimentally verified, accuracy rate reached
   99.6\%.},

Abstract = {Phishing emails often disguise a link's actual URL. Thus, common
   anti-phishing advice is to check a link's URL before clicking, but email
   clients do not support this well. Automated phishing detection enables
   email clients to warn users that an email is suspicious, but current
   warnings are often not specific. We evaluated the effects on phishing
   susceptibility of (1) moving phishing warnings close to the suspicious
   link in the email, (2) displaying the warning on hover interactions with
   the link, and (3) forcing attention to the warning by deactivating the
   original link, forcing users to click the URL in the warning. We
   assessed the effectiveness of such link-focused phishing warning designs
   in a between-subjects online experiment (n=701). We found that
   link-focused phishing warnings reduced phishing click-through rates
   compared to email banner warnings; forced attention warnings were most
   effective. We discuss the implications of our findings for phishing
   warning design.},

Abstract = {There is a growing use of email-based provision of information,
   development of health-related skills and interventions; however, use of
   email to assist women and children experiencing abuse after receiving
   Protection from Abuse (PFA) court order has not been explored. The
   specific aim of this research was to test the feasibility of an email
   device called MIVO for use in interacting with women and children after
   receiving PFA. This qualitative design used a three-step recruitment,
   screening and email interaction with mothers and their adolescent child
   after obtaining informed consent and training in the use of an email
   device. Sample included six pairs of mother and child (n = 12) who have
   received a PFA within the past 6 months. Demographic data were gathered
   using the sociodemographic questionnaire. Qualitative data were gathered
   using email messages from mother and child pairs. Results showed that
   email interaction is a feasible and acceptable way of providing support
   and information to survivors of abuse after their PFA. The following
   themes in their order and rank of appearance were found in the email
   interaction between the nurse and survivors: (1) safety issues; (2)
   job-related issues; (3) school-related issues; (4) parenting-related
   issues; and (5) health-related issues. Themes identified for the
   children were school work and friends. Privacy, confidentiality and
   respect for individual rights are paramount in email interactions. Email
   interaction is useful in education, screening, safety instructions and
   follow-up care. Technological devices such as MIVO may have usefulness
   as an email interaction device among women, their child and a nurse to
   reduce their risk for further interpersonal violence/abuse and to
   increase disclosure of abuse. Healthcare providers need to identify
   technological developments, and through evidence-based research examine
   their feasibility and adaptability for translation into practice
   specifically, in caring for survivors of abuse.},

Title = {Incorporating user feedback in the design of a genetics analysis tool: A
   two-part approach},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {95},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {While general usability assessment models for websites have been
   developed for a wide variety of contexts, research literature on
   incorporating user feedback in the design of online scientific tools is
   lacking. In this article, we present an approach that we developed and
   illustrate how it was used to elicit user feedback of the
   AnalyzeMyVariant tool, which enables geneticists to use family pedigree
   data to calculate pathogenicity likelihood ratios for variants of
   unknown significance.
   We reviewed existing usability literature and developed a survey
   instrument emphasizing concepts of importance to online, data-driven,
   scientific tools. The items on the survey instrument were grouped in
   four categories: usability, quality, privacy and security, and
   satisfaction. We performed a two-part evaluation using the survey and a
   semi-structured interview protocol. The survey instrument was used to
   collect data about the use experience of AnalyzeMyVariant from 57
   genetic experts and trainees who were recruited via email invitations.
   We also conducted semi-structured interviews with six genetics experts
   to explore work contexts in which users might use the tool and further
   delve into issues faced in tool use. Interviews were inductively coded
   and major themes identified using the constant comparative method. We
   found that the needs of genetics professionals vary for research- and
   clinically-focused work. These differences can inform the design of
   tools to serve their needs.
   The major contribution of this work is the description of a two-part
   method to elicit user feedback to inform the design of online,
   data-driven, scientific tools, which focuses on constructs of particular
   relevance to these tools such as usability, quality, privacy, security,
   and satisfaction. The survey instrument that we developed, coupled with
   contextual interviews, may serve as an example that can be used by
   others conducting usability studies of similar tools. In addition, our
   results emphasize the importance of considering contextual factors such
   as background knowledge, situational factors, and the intended
   application of results, in the usability evaluation of scientific
   software. It is our hope that this two-part approach might be adapted to
   assess the usability of other online scientific tools and facilitate the
   design of tools to meet the needs of their target audiences.},

Abstract = {Multi-Factor Authentication is intended to strengthen the security of
   password-based authentication by adding another factor, such as hardware
   tokens or one-time passwords using mobile apps.
   However, this increased authentication security comes with potential
   drawbacks that can lead to account and asset loss. If users lose access
   to their additional authentication factors for any reason, they will be
   locked out of their accounts. Consequently, services that provide
   Multi-Factor Authentication should deploy procedures to allow their
   users to recover from losing access to their additional factor that are
   both secure and easy-to-use.
   In this work, we investigate the security and user experience of
   Multi-Factor Authentication recovery procedures, and compare their
   deployment to descriptions on help and support pages.
   We first evaluate the official help and support pages of 1,303 websites
   that provide Multi-Factor Authentication and collect documented
   information about their recovery procedures. Second, we select a subset
   of 71 websites, create accounts, set up Multi-Factor Authentication, and
   perform an in-depth investigation of their recovery procedure security
   and user experience.
   We find that many websites deploy insecure Multi-Factor Authentication
   recovery procedures and allowed us to circumvent and disable
   Multi-Factor Authentication when having access to the accounts'
   associated email addresses. Furthermore, we commonly observed
   discrepancies between our in-depth analysis and the official help and
   support pages, implying that information meant to aid users is often
   either incorrect or outdated.
   Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for best practices
   regarding Multi-Factor Authentication recovery.},

Abstract = {Unsolicited Commercial Email, or Spam, is nowadays an increasingly
   serious problem to email users. A number of anti-spam schemes have been
   proposed in the literature and some of them have been deployed in email
   systems, but the problem has yet been well addressed. One of those
   schemes is challenge-response, in which a challenge, ranging from a
   simple mathematical problem to a hard-AI problem, is imposed on an email
   sender in order to forbid machine-based spam reaching receivers'
   mailboxes. However, such a scheme introduces new problems for the users,
   e.g., delay of service and denial of service. In this paper, we
   introduce the pre-challenge scheme, which is based on the
   challenge-response mechanism and takes advantage of some features of
   email systems. It assumes each user has a challenge that is defined by
   the user himself/herself and associated with his/her email address, in
   such a way that an email sender can simultaneously retrieve a new
   receiver's email address and challenge before sending an email in the
   first contact. Some new mechanisms are employed in our scheme to reach a
   good balance between security against spam and convenience to normal
   email users. Our scheme can be also used for protecting other messaging
   systems, like Instant Messaging and Blog comments. (c) 2006 Published by

Abstract = {CBT-based mental health apps have been introduced as a promise in
   helping people to deal with common mental illnesses. Although there is a
   high number of users, their adherence to the apps is significantly low.
   Meanwhile, the reasons for this circumstance are not well examined. The
   question of which features engage users to use and continue using are
   not well understood. This study will try to address this gap in
   literature. The study focuses on apps where the core design is primarily
   based on a CBT approach. The review analysis shows that users highly
   appreciate the ability to monitor and reflect themselves, and to figure
   out what is going on in their mood of the apps. Also, the ability to
   send notifications, prompts or email to remind users to perform related
   tasks are the helpful way make users stay focused and engaged. Besides,
   the ability to provide different interactions for patients and
   clinicians is also got high appreciation. Most of design-related
   feedback takes careful consideration on ease-of-use characteristics and
   research-based features. By contrast, technical issues are the most
   common reason making users quit using the interventions. Other aspects
   that generate complaints also focus on a lack of customer services,
   clear security measures and privacy policy. Similarly, many users
   complain when the apps are complicated in design and have a lot of
   advertisement contents. Therefore, in order to enhance user experience
   and user adherence, these features should be carefully considered in the
   design phase during the development process of the apps.},

Abstract = {Motivated by the need to automatically generate behavior-based security
   challenges to improve user authentication for web services, we consider
   the problem of large-scale construction of realisticlooking names to
   serve as aliases for real individuals. We aim to use these names to
   construct security challenges, where users are asked to identify their
   real contacts among a presented pool of names. We seek these look-alike
   names to preserve name characteristics like gender, ethnicity, and
   popularity, while being unlinkable back to the source individual,
   thereby making the real contacts not easily guessable by attackers. To
   achive this, we introduce the technique of distributed name embeddings,
   representing names in a high-dimensional space such that distance
   between name components reflects the degree of cultural similarity
   between these strings. We present different approaches to construct name
   embeddings from contact lists observed at a large web-mail provider, and
   evaluate their cultural coherence. We demonstrate that name embeddings
   strongly encode gender and ethnicity, as well as name popularity. We
   applied this algorithm to generate imitation names in email contact list
   challenge. Our controlled user study verified that the proposed
   technique reduced the attacker's success rate to 26.08\%,
   indistinguishable from random guessing, compared to a success rate of
   62.16\% from previous name generation algorithms. Finally, we use these
   embeddings to produce an open synthetic name resource of 1 million names
   for security applications, constructed to respect both cultural
   coherence and U.S. census name frequencies.},

Abstract = {Any communication via Internet travels across unsecured channels. This
   gives raise to security breaches. So user identification and
   authentication is needed to overcome these security breaches.
   Password-based systems remain the predominant method of user
   authentication despite the many sophisticated and viable security
   alternatives that have emerged. However, this survey shows that
   passwords are often compromised through the poor security and management
   practices of users. This paper also concentrates on user password
   composition and security practices for email accounts. The results of a
   survey that examines user practice in creating and using passwords are
   reported. Toward the end of this paper, we give some recommendation for
   the education of user in creating and maintaining their passwords.},

Abstract = {Emails constitute the bulk of all official communications in any
   organization. Email repositories are tacit store-houses of knowledge
   about people, projects and processes. Mining one's own email repository
   can also provide interesting and valuable insights about his or her
   engagements and contacts along different dimensions. In this paper, we
   propose an email analytics framework that combines text-mining, network
   analysis and data analytics principles to mine email repositories for
   useful insights. While individuals are more attuned to looking at emails
   as individual items along with a history that is embedded in the trail,
   mining the whole collection can also lead to knowledge-discovery about
   similarities and dissimilarities of different engagements. This in turn
   can lead to valuable information like comparative status reports on
   various projects or deeper insights about why certain projects succeed
   while others don't. Given the volumes, diversity and noisy nature of
   e-mails, it becomes impossible for human beings to comprehend the impact
   of all of it unless the task is automated and approached in a structured
   fashion. We show that combination of text and network analytics along
   with temporal reasoning can provide valuable insights about task-states,
   actionable items, recommendations and forecasts. These insights can be
   exploited very effectively for project-management tasks like automated
   identification of bottlenecks or their causes, elimination of
   inefficiencies, early-warnings and suggestions about proactive measures
   to avoid problems. It is possible to extend the framework quite easily
   to analyze multiple email repositories of different users, though this
   work does not address the privacy or security concerns that might exist.},

Abstract = {Life has become more comfortable in the era of advanced technology in
   this cutthroat competitive world. However, there are also emerging
   harmful technologies that pose a threat. Without a doubt, phishing is
   one of the rising concerns that leads to stealing vital information such
   as passwords, security codes, and personal data from any target node
   through communication hijacking techniques. In addition, phishing
   attacks include delivering false messages that originate from a trusted
   source. Moreover, a phishing attack aims to get the victim to run
   malicious programs and reveal confidential data, such as bank
   credentials, one-time passwords, and user login credentials. The sole
   intention is to collect personal information through malicious
   program-based attempts embedded in URLs, emails, and website-based
   attempts. Notably, this proposed technique detects URL, email, and
   website-based phishing attacks, which will be beneficial and secure us
   from scam attempts. Subsequently, the data are pre-processed to identify
   phishing attacks using data cleaning, attribute selection, and attacks
   detected using machine learning techniques. Furthermore, the proposed
   techniques use heuristic-based machine learning to identify phishing
   attacks. Admittedly, 56 features are used to analyze URL phishing
   findings, and experimental results show that the proposed technique has
   a better accuracy of 97.2\%. Above all, the proposed techniques for
   email phishing detection obtain a higher accuracy of 97.4\%. In
   addition, the proposed technique for website phishing detection has a
   better accuracy of 98.1\%, and 48 features are used for analysis.},

Abstract = {The problem with email image spam classification is known from the year
   2005. There are several approaches to this task. Lately, those
   approaches use convolutional neural networks (CNN). We propose a novel
   approach to the image spam classification task. Our approach is based on
   CNN and transfer learning, namely Resnet v1 used for semantic feature
   extraction and one layer Feedforward Neural Network for classification.
   We have shown that this approach can achieve state-of-the-art
   performance on publicly available datasets. 99\% F1-score on two
   datasets (Dredze et al., 2007), Princeton and 96\% F1-score on the
   combination of these datasets. Due to the availability of GPUs, this
   approach may be used for just-in-time classification in anti-spam
   systems handling huge amounts of emails. We have observed also that
   mentioned publicly available datasets are no longer representative. We
   overcame this limitation by using a much richer dataset from a one-week
   long real traffic of the freemail provider Email.cz. The training data
   annotation was created by user labeling of the emails. The image spam
   (and image ham even more) tackles privacy issues. We overcame it by
   publishing extracted feature vectors with associated classes (instead of
   images itself). This data does not violate privacy issues. We have
   published Email.cz image spam dataset v1 via the AcademicTorrents
   platform and propose a system, which achieves up to 96\% F1-score with
   presented model architecture on this novel dataset. Providing our
   dataset to the community may help others with solving similar tasks.},

Title = {Applying machine learning and natural language processing to detect
   phishing email},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {110},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The growth of online services has been accompanied by increased growth
   in cyber-attacks. One of the most common effective attacks is phishing,
   in which attempts are made to steal confidential information by
   impersonating a legitimate source. The success of phishing emails is
   based on manipulating human emotions, which leads to concerns and
   creates an urgent situation by claiming that the recipient should take
   quick action that may cause great financial and data losses. Therefore,
   we cannot rely solely on humans to detect phishing, and more effective
   and automatic phishing detection mechanisms are required. Many detectors
   have been proposed; however, the high number of phishing emails urges
   additional effort. Hence, in this study, we propose a phishing email
   classifier model that applies deep learning algorithms using a graph
   convolutional network (GCN) and natural language processing over an
   email body text to improve phishing detection accuracy. The literature
   has proved GCN success in text classification, and this study proved its
   success in improving the accuracy of email phishing detection. The
   classifier was tested in a supervised learning approach. Experimental
   tests verified that the classifier was effective in detecting phishing
   emails using body text among the existing detection methods, and it took
   short time and produced a high accuracy rate of 98.2\% and a low
   false-positive rate of 0.015. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {As a fundamental communicative service, email is playing an important
   role in both individual and corporate communications, which also makes
   it one of the most frequently attack vectors. An email's authenticity is
   based on an authentication chain involving multiple protocols, roles and
   services, the inconsistency among which creates security threats. Thus,
   it depends on the weakest link of the chain, as any failed part can
   break the whole chain-based defense.
   This paper systematically analyzes the transmission of an email and
   identifies a series of new attacks capable of bypassing SPF, DKIM, DMARC
   and user-interface protections. In particular, by conducting a
   ``cocktail{''} joint attack, more realistic emails can be forged to
   penetrate the celebrated email services, such as Gmail and Outlook. We
   conduct a largescale experiment on 30 popular email services and 23
   email clients, and find that all of them are vulnerable to certain types
   of new attacks. We have duly reported the identified vulnerabilities to
   the related email service providers, and received positive responses
   from 11 of them, including Gmail, Yahoo, iCloud and Alibaba.
   Furthermore, we propose key mitigating measures to defend against the
   new attacks. Therefore, this work is of great value for identifying
   email spoofing attacks and improving the email ecosystem's overall
   security.},

Abstract = {This paper describes the forensic and intelligence analysis capabilities
   of the Email Mining Toolkit (EMT) under development at the Columbia
   Intrusion Detection (IDS) Lab. EMT provides the means of loading,
   parsing and analyzing email logs, including content, in a wide range of
   formats. Many tools and techniques have been available from the fields
   of Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) for
   analyzing documents of various sorts, including emails. EMT, however,
   extends these kinds of, analyses with an entirely new set of analyses
   that model ``user behavior{''}. EMT thus model's the behavior of
   individual user email accounts, or groups of accounts, including the
   ``social cliques{''} revealed by a user's email behavior.},

Abstract = {Network security problems still exist when IPv4 transfers to IPv6. The
   current Email framework neither authenticates the sender nor traces the
   source of the mail, so even find a spam, the method is just to reject
   the mail or insert the mail source into ``blacklist{''}, and both of
   these methods can't deracinate the generation of spam. For this reason,
   this paper designs secure email system based on true IPv6 address
   access. It divides the authentication to inter-domain and intra-domain
   authentication. Inter-domain authentication is used to authenticate the
   mail sender's domain. It combines path-based authentication,
   encryption-based authentication and trust and prestige system-based
   authentication methods in order to support both mail forwarding and mail
   list. Authentication efficiency can be further improved by organizing
   authentication order properly. Intra-domain is used to affirm the
   sender's IP address which is used to trace the sender. It supports user
   to move by combining the fixed and changing IP address. After testing,
   this system is both feasible and effective.},

Abstract = {Understanding the capabilities of adversaries (e.g., how much the
   adversary knows about a target) is important for building strong
   security defenses. Computing an adversary's knowledge about a target
   requires new modeling techniques and experimental methods. Our work
   describes a quantitative analysis technique for modeling an adversary's
   knowledge about private information at workplace. Our technical enabler
   is a new emulation environment for conducting user experiments on attack
   behaviors. We develop a role-playing cyber game for our evaluation,
   where the participants take on the adversary role to launch ID theft
   attacks by answering challenge questions about a target. We measure an
   adversary's knowledge based on how well he or she answers the
   authentication questions about a target. We present our empirical
   modeling results based on the data collected from a total of 36 users.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, many services in the internet including Email, search engine,
   social networking are provided with free of charge due to enormous
   growth of web users. With the expansion of Web services, denial of
   service (DoS) attacks by malicious automated programs (e.g., web bots)
   is becoming a serious problem of web service accounts. A HIP, or Human
   Interactive Proofs, is a human authentication mechanism that generates
   and grades tests to determine whether the user is a human or a malicious
   computer program. Unfortunately, the existing HIPs tried to maximize the
   difficulty for automated programs to pass tests by increasing distortion
   or noise. Consequently, it has also become difficult for potential users
   too. So there is a tradeoff between the usability and robustness in
   designing HIP tests. In our proposed technique we tried to balance the
   readability and security by adding contextual information in the form of
   natural conversation without reducing the distortion and noise. In the
   result section, a microscopic large-scale user study was conducted
   involving 110 users to investigate the actual user views compare to
   existing state of the art CAPTCHA systems like Google's reCAPTCHA and
   Microsoft's CAPTCHA in terms of usability and security and found our
   system capable of deploying largely over internet.},

Abstract = {Password security standards based on the Shannon Entropy were made to
   ensure that users are protected from attacks. This research investigates
   the possibility of breaking the password security standards using
   offline attacks and public user attributes. The idea here is to reduce
   the keyspace by collecting a character set that is likely to be chosen
   as a password. Ten million compromised passwords were used to establish
   the Dictionary Character Set, while 1.4 billion compromised email
   accounts were used to establish the User-Attribute Character Set. Based
   on the experiments conducted, we proved that there is a high chance of
   breaking 8 - 10 character length passwords in a reasonable time.
   Dictionary and Attribute-Based attacks were proved to work in the wild
   based on cracking time and the number of compromised passwords in the
   datasets. Results show that it is possible to break the password
   standards using offline attacks and public user attributes in a
   reasonable time. A Machine Sensitive Key Based Password Strength Metric
   is then proposed based on the ratio of risk and safe probabilities of
   the password. The metric is based on the measurements gathered from the
   Brute Force, Dictionary and Attribute-Based Password Attacks.},

Abstract = {A leading cause of security breaches is a basic human vulnerability: our
   susceptibility to deception. Hackers exploit this vulnerability by
   sending phishing emails that induce users to click on malicious links
   that then download malware or trick the victim into revealing personal
   confidential information to the hacker. Past research has focused on
   human susceptibility to generic phishing emails or individually targeted
   spear-phishing emails. This study addresses how contextualization of
   phishing emails for targeted groups impacts their susceptibility to
   phishing. We manipulated the framing and content of email messages and
   tested the effects on users' susceptibility to phishing. We constructed
   phishing emails to elicit either the fear of losing something valuable
   (e.g., course registrations, tuition assistance) or the anticipation of
   gaining something desirable (e.g., iPad, gift card, social networks). We
   designed the emails' context to manipulate human psychological
   weaknesses such as greed, social needs, and so on. We sent fictitious
   (benign) emails to 7,225 undergraduate students and recorded their
   responses. Results revealed that contextualizing messages to appeal to
   recipients' psychological weaknesses increased their susceptibility to
   phishing. The fear of losing or anticipation of gaining something
   valuable increased susceptibility to deception and vulnerability to
   phishing. The results of our study provide important contributions to
   information security research, including a theoretical framework based
   on the heuristic-systematic processing model to study the susceptibility
   of users to deception. We demonstrate through our experiment that
   several situational factors do, in fact, alter the effectiveness of
   phishing attempts.},

Abstract = {Email phishing, such as spear phishing attacks, has become increasingly
   sophisticated. Automatic phishing detection models and anti-phishing
   education and awareness programs remain insufficient in guarding against
   general phishing attacks, which are even more ineffective in dealing
   with spear phishing. Understanding human receivers' interaction behavior
   with phishing emails can be instrumental in improving the effectiveness
   of anti-phishing training and human phishing detection. To this end, eye
   movement behavior can serve as a lens reflecting human cognitive
   processes and attention. This study focuses on examining the effects of
   email legitimacy and phishing behavior training on receivers' eye
   movement behavior by analyzing their eye-tracking data. The findings
   have implications for developing spear phishing training programs and
   improving phishing detection models that can improve online safety of

Abstract = {Due to the challenges to detect and filter phishing emails, it is
   inevitable that some phishing emails can still reach a user's inbox. As
   a result, email providers such as Gmail have implemented phishing
   warnings to help users to better recognize phishing attempts. Existing
   research has primarily focused on phishing warnings for sighted users
   and yet it is not well understood how people with visual impairments
   interact with phishing emails and warnings. In this paper, we worked
   with a group of users (N=41) with visual impairments to study the
   effectiveness of existing warnings and explore more inclusive designs
   (using Gmail warning designs as a baseline for comparison). We took a
   multipronged approach including an exploratory study (to understand the
   challenges faced by users), user-in-the-loop design and prototyping, and
   the main study (to assess the impact of design choices). Our results
   show that users with visual impairments often miss existing Gmail
   warnings because the current design (e.g., warning position, HTML tags
   used) does not match well with screen reader users' reading habits. The
   inconsistencies of the warnings (e.g., across the Standard and HTML
   view) also create obstacles to users. We show that an inclusive design
   (combining audio warning, shortcut key, and warning page overlay) can
   effectively increase the warning noticeability. Based on our results, we
   make a number of recommendations to email providers.},

Abstract = {Email phishing has become very prevalent especially now that most of our
   dealings have become technical. The victim receives a message that looks
   as if it was sent from a known party and the attack is carried out
   through a fake cookie that includes a phishing program or through links
   connected to fake websites, in both cases the goal is to install
   malicious software on the user's device or direct him to a fake website.
   Today it is difficult to deploy robust cybersecurity solutions without
   relying heavily on machine learning algorithms. This research seeks to
   detect phishing emails using high-accuracy machine learning techniques.
   using the WEKA tool with data preprocessing we create a proposed
   methodology to detect emails phishing. outperformed random forest
   algorithm on Naive Bayes algorithms by accuracy of 99.03 \%.},

Title = {Going Remote-Demonstration and Evaluation of Remote Technology Delivery
   and Usability Assessment With Older Adults: Survey Study},
Journal = {JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated ``going remote{''} with
   the delivery, support, and assessment of a study intervention targeting
   older adults enrolled in a clinical trial. While remotely delivering and
   assessing technology is not new, there are few methods available in the
   literature that are proven to be effective with diverse populations, and
   none for older adults specifically. Older adults comprise a diverse
   population, including in terms of their experience with and access to
   technology, making this a challenging endeavor.
   Objective: Our objective was to remotely deliver and conduct usability
   testing for a mobile health (mHealth) technology intervention for older
   adult participants enrolled in a clinical trial of the technology. This
   paper describes the methodology used, its successes, and its
   limitations.
   Methods: We developed a conceptual model for remote operations, called
   the Framework for Agile and Remote Operations (FAR Ops), that combined
   the general requirements for spaceflight operations with Agile project
   management processes to quickly respond to this challenge. Using this
   framework, we iteratively created care packages that differed in their
   contents based on participant needs and were sent to study participants
   to deliver the study intervention-a medication management app-and assess
   its usability. Usability data were collected using the System Usability
   Scale (SUS) and a novel usability questionnaire developed to collect
   more in-depth data.
   Results: In the first 6 months of the project, we successfully delivered
   21 care packages. We successfully designed and deployed a minimum viable
   product in less than 6 weeks, generally maintained a 2-week sprint
   cycle, and achieved a 40\% to 50\% return rate for both usability
   assessment instruments. We hypothesize that lack of engagement due to
   the pandemic and our use of asynchronous communication channels
   contributed to the return rate of usability assessments being lower than
   desired. We also provide general recommendations for performing remote
   usability testing with diverse populations based on the results of our
   work, including implementing screen sharing capabilities when possible,
   and determining participant preference for phone or email
   communications.
   Conclusions: The FAR Ops model allowed our team to adopt remote
   operations for our mHealth trial in response to interruptions from the
   COVID-19 pandemic. This approach can be useful for other research or
   practice-based projects under similar circumstances or to improve
   efficiency, cost, effectiveness, and participant diversity in general.
   In addition to offering a replicable approach, this paper tells the
   often-untold story of practical challenges faced by mHealth projects and
   practical strategies used to address them.},

Abstract = {We present Lightweight Email Signatures (LES), a simple cryptographic
   architecture for authenticating email. LES is an extension of DKIM, the
   recent IETF effort to standardize domain-based email signatures. LES
   shares DKIM's ease of deployment: they both use the DNS to distribute a
   single public key for each domain. Importantly, LES supports common uses
   of email that DKIM jeopardizes: multiple email personalities, firewalled
   ISPs, incoming-only email forwarding services, and other common uses
   that often require sending email via a third-party SMTP server. In
   addition, LES does not require DKIM's implied intra-domain mechanism for
   authenticating users when they send email.
   LES provides these features using identity-based signatures. Each domain
   authority generates a master keypair, publishes the public component in
   the DNS, and stores the private component securely. Using this private
   component, the authority delivers to each of its users, via email, an
   individual secret key whose identity string corresponds to the user's
   email address. A sender then signs messages using this individual secret
   key. A recipient verifies such a signature by querying the appropriate
   master public key from the DNS, computing the sender's public key, and
   verifying the signature accordingly. As an added bonus, the widespread
   availability of user-level public keys enables deniable authentication,
   such as ring signatures. Thus, LES provides email authentication with
   optional repudiability.
   We built a LES prototype to determine its practicality. Basic user tests
   show that the system is relatively easy to use, and that cryptographic
   performance, even when using deniable authentication, is well within
   acceptable range.},

Title = {Indicators of employee phishing email behaviours: Intuition,

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Employees' behaviour to phishing emails can strengthen or undermine
   business organisations' cyber security. This phishing simulation and
   survey study explored the relationship between sociodemographic, cyber
   security training, phishing email typology and information processing
   factors and risky and secure email response be-haviours. Participants (N
   = 590) were employees of a large financial institution who received one
   of four types of phishing emails. Participants who engaged in risky
   cyber email behaviour clicked on the link in the phishing email whereas
   those who engaged in secure cyber email behaviour reported the email to
   the institutions cyber security team. Our findings show that the
   likelihood of clicking on a link in a phishing email was lower for
   participants who had greater faith in their intuition and paid more
   attention to the sender's email address. The likelihood of clicking on a
   link in a phishing email was greater for participants who received the
   `Undelivered package' email relative to the `Received PDF'. The
   likelihood of reporting a phishing email was greater for participants
   who engaged in greater elaborative processing to evaluate the email than
   those who used less elaboration. Theoretical and practical implications
   as well as future directions are discussed.},

Abstract = {Years have lapsed since the inauguration of the first Wireless
   Application Protocol (WAP) application. One of the main reasons for the
   lukewarm response so far may be attributed to the lack of a ``Killer{''}
   application. Many companies and developers have attempted to replicate
   email services (an Internet Killer appplication) within the WAP realm,
   but till now, no significant success has been reported. This paper will
   first discuss on the key functions which are lacking in the present
   WAP-email service, and which are arguably necessary if a much larger
   user base is to be attracted to these services. A new system will be
   proposed which can enable the user to send files residing in a remote
   personal computer (PC) as attachments to his emails using WAP-enabled
   mobile devices. The implementation of the system will be presented in
   details. Issue relating to the connection to various types of email
   servers and the security of the system will also be addressed in the
   paper. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Email communication plays a crucial role in both personal and
   professional contexts; however, it is frequently compromised by the
   ongoing challenge of spam, which detracts from productivity and
   introduces considerable security risks. Current spam detection
   techniques often struggle to keep pace with the evolving tactics
   employed by spammers, resulting in user dissatisfaction and potential
   data breaches. To address this issue, we introduce the Divide and
   Conquer-Generative Adversarial Network Squeeze and Excitation-Based
   Framework (DaCGANSAEBF), an innovative deep-learning model designed to
   identify spam emails. This framework incorporates cutting-edge
   technologies, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Squeeze and
   Excitation (SAE) modules, and a newly formulated Light Dual Attention
   (LDA) mechanism, which effectively utilizes both global and local
   attention to discern intricate patterns within textual data. This
   approach significantly improves efficiency and accuracy by segmenting
   scanned email content into smaller, independently evaluated components.
   The model underwent training and validation using four publicly
   available benchmark datasets, achieving an impressive average accuracy
   of 98.87\%, outperforming leading methods in the field. These findings
   underscore the resilience and scalability of DaCGANSAEBF, positioning it
   as a viable solution for contemporary spam detection systems. The
   framework can be easily integrated into existing technologies to enhance
   user security and reduce the risks associated with spam.},

Abstract = {Poor usability of clinical information systems delays their adoption by
   clinicians and limits potential improvements to the efficiency and
   safety of care. Recurring usability evaluations are therefore, integral
   to the system design process. We compared four methods employed during
   the development of outpatient clinical documentation software: clinician
   email response, online survey, observations and interviews. Results
   suggest that no single method identifies all or most problems. Rather,
   each approach is optimal for evaluations at a different stage of design
   and characterizes different usability aspect. Email responses elicited
   from clinicians and surveys report mostly technical, biomedical,
   terminology and control problems and are most effective when a working
   prototype has been completed. Observations of clinical work and
   interviews inform conceptual and workflow-related problems and are best
   performed early in the cycle. Appropriate use of these methods
   consistently during development may significantly improve system
   usability and contribute to higher adoption rates among clinicians and
   to improved quality of care. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Surveillance is a critical measure to break anonymity. While
   surveillance with unlimited resources is often assumed as a means,
   against which, to design stronger anonymity algorithms, this paper
   addresses the general impact of limited resource on surveillance
   efficiency. The general impact of limited resource on identifying a
   hidden group is experimentally studied; the task of identification is
   only done by following communications between suspects, i.e., the
   information of whos talking to whom. The surveillance uses simple but
   intuitive algorithms to return more intelligence with limited resource.
   The surveillance subject used in this work is the publicly available
   Enron email data set, an actual trace of human interaction. The initial
   expectation was that, even with limited resource, intuitive surveillance
   algorithms would return the higher intelligence than a random approach
   by exploiting the general properties of power law-style communication
   map. To the contrary, the impact of limited resource was found large to
   the extent that intuitive algorithms do not return significantly higher
   intelligence than a random approach.},

Abstract = {Information technology is considered as a key enabler to achieve
   ``education for all{''} as a sustainable development goal; however,
   involvement in the education sector has introduced security risks along
   with benefits. Students' exposure to the internet has increased the
   probability of cybersecurity attacks. To foster a more sustainable use
   of technology, it is crucial that students are made aware of information
   security risks and can keep themselves protected in the online sphere.
   In this paper, we present the results of a cross-sectional study that
   explores information-security awareness among students in Saudi Arabia.
   Empirical data were collected using an online questionnaire and a factor
   analysis was conducted using partial least-squares structured equation
   modelling. Based on the existing literature, we focused on four key
   constructs: password management, infrastructure management, email
   management, and the perception of security. The results of this study
   have highlighted that email management and infrastructure management
   were seen as relevant factors, whereas password management and the
   perception of security were not considered relevant factors by the
   respondents. We have also chalked out recommendations to improve
   cybersecurity awareness among students. The findings of this study will
   potentially help educational institutions and parents to prepare
   students in adopting security practices while they are online.},

Abstract = {The password recovery process is a critical part of a website's
   functionality. Many websites that provide online services to their users
   also need to solve the problem of allowing their users to reset their
   passwords (e.g., if they have forgotten it). A popular, established
   technique for allowing a user to recover a lost account is to allow her
   to send a reset link to her own account via email. Although it might
   seem easy at a first glance, the security requirements of the password
   recovery process require web sites to carefully design each step of the
   process to be resilient even in the presence of an attack. In this
   paper, we present an in-depth security analysis of the email-based
   recovery mechanisms of a wide range of web applications. By manually
   registering accounts and triggering the password recovery process for
   each website, we were able to study the password reset mechanisms of web
   sites from three different groups in the Alexa Top 5K (i.e., popular
   sites, medium popular sites, low popular sites). In this work, we show
   that the lack of standards in the password recovery process plagues many
   websites with security weaknesses, and negatively influences the
   security of the reset process itself. We also show that concrete
   password-recovery reset attacks can be launched against a high
   percentage of websites that might even lead to account takeover.},

   information, smartphones also store sensor data about users and their
   daily activities. In order to understand users' behaviors and attitudes
   towards the security of their smartphone data, we conducted 28
   qualitative interviews. We examined why users choose (or choose not) to
   employ locking mechanisms (e.g., PINs) and their perceptions and
   awareness about the sensitivity of the data stored on their devices. We
   performed two additional online experiments to quantify our interview
   results and the extent to which sensitive data could be found in a
   user's smartphone-accessible email archive. We observed a strong
   correlation between use of security features and risk perceptions, which
   indicates rational behavior. However, we also observed that most users
   likely underestimate the extent to which data stored on their
   smartphones pervades their identities, online and offline.},

Abstract = {Human is the weakest link in information security. Even with strong
   cyber security policies an organization can still be hacked because of a
   human error. Even if people are aware of the policies and their
   importance they might not behave accordingly. This shows to the
   importance of studying and measuring human behavior toward cyber
   security policies. This paper introduces a new instrument that can be
   used to measure human behavior toward cybersecurity policies through
   creative measures. The goal is to gather data about human behaviors
   toward cybersecurity policies in natural environment. This method of
   gathering information allows people to behave normally and don't feel
   the need to answer perfectly. The paper illustrates all the previous
   work related to the subject, summarizing previous work in order to
   improve what have been previously done. The methodology seeks on
   measuring behavior based on specific measures. These measures are the
   password, email, identity, sensitive data, and physical/resource
   security. Each measure has a number of policies used to measure
   behavior. These policies were selected among several policies based on
   literature from the same field and the opinion of experts in the field.
   These question that went through several rounds of check were used to
   build the proposed instrument. This instrument then shall be used by
   researchers to collect data and perform the required analysis. This

Abstract = {Chain and multi-recipient e-mails pose significant security and privacy
   threats such as phishing and the spread of Trojan horses. They also
   increase the chances of receiving spam e-mails. E-mails sent to multiple
   recipients at a time result in unwanted exposure of e-mail address to
   multiple recipients. The recipients of chain e-mails may include
   spammers or e- mail addresses of users whose e-mail account or device
   may have been compromised, thereby, exposing all email addresses to
   spammers. Forwarding or sending a multirecipient e-mail in a chain
   further increases the exposure of email addresses to spammers. This
   paper discusses chain emails, multi-recipient e-mails and crucial
   security and privacy threats they pose to legitimate e-mail user. It
   also discusses various possible mechanisms to mitigate these threats and
   investigates their effectiveness. This study proposes a novel technique
   to counter these security risks by enhancing the default behaviour of
   e-mail client, SMPT server and SMTP protocol. The proposed technique has
   been implemented in the Java programming language which showed promising
   results against unnecessary exposure of multiple e-mail addresses while
   sending an e-mail to multiple recipients.},

Abstract = {The ubiquity of user accounts in websites and online services makes
   account hijacking a serious security concern. Although previous research
   has studied various techniques through which an attacker can gain access
   to a victim's account, relatively little attention has been directed
   towards the process of account creation. The current trend towards
   federated authentication (e.g., Single Sign-On) adds an additional layer
   of complexity because many services now support both the classic
   approach in which the user directly sets a password, and the federated
   approach in which the user authenticates via an identity provider.
   Inspired by previous work on preemptive account hijacking {[}17], we
   show that there exists a whole class of account pre-hijacking attacks.
   The distinctive feature of these attacks is that the attacker performs
   some action before the victim creates an account, which makes it trivial
   for the attacker to gain access after the victim has created/recovered
   the account. Assuming a realistic attacker who knows only the victim's
   email address, we identify and discuss five different types of account
   pre-hijacking attacks.
   To ascertain the prevalence of such vulnerabilities in the wild, we
   analyzed 75 popular services and found that at least 35 of these were
   vulnerable to one or more account pre-hijacking attacks. Whilst some of
   these may be noticed by attentive users, others were completely
   undetectable from the victim's perspective. Finally, we investigated the
   root cause of these vulnerabilities and present a set of security
   requirements to prevent such vulnerabilities arising in future.},

Abstract = {S/MIME and OpenPGP use cryptographic constructions repeatedly shown to
   be vulnerable to format oracle attacks in protocols like TLS, SSH, or
   IKE. However, format oracle attacks in the End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)
   email setting are considered impractical as victims would need to open
   many attacker-modified emails and communicate the decryption result to
   the attacker. But is this really the case?
   In this paper, we survey how an attacker may remotely learn the
   decryption state in email E2EE. We analyze the interplay of MIME and
   IMAP and describe side-channels emerging from network patterns that leak
   the decryption status in Mail User Agents (MUAs). Concretely, we
   introduce specific MIME trees that produce decryption-dependent network
   patterns when opened in a victim's email client.
   We survey 19 OpenPGP- and S/MIME-enabled email clients and four
   cryptographic libraries and uncover a side-channel leaking the
   decryption status of S/MIME messages in one client. Further, we discuss
   why the exploitation in the other clients is impractical and show that
   it is due to missing feature support and implementation quirks. These
   unintended defenses create an unfortunate conflict between usability and
   security. We present more rigid countermeasures for MUA developers and
   the standards to prevent exploitation.},

   incident reporting) and weighed to three dimension of knowledge
   (knowledge, attitude, and behavior). The result of ISA measurement in
   the XYZ employee considered as good with total score 87.59. However,
   this study indicates that employee's information security awareness on

Year = {2017},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The extent to which users take precautionary actions against cyber risks
   is conditional upon how they perceive the value of information security
   relative to other important personal goals. In most cyber security
   contexts, users are faced with trade-offs between information security
   and other important attributes that they desire to maximize. We examined
   this issue by eliciting the ``security premiums{''} that users were
   willing to sacrifice to protect their information security in a phishing
   context. We also examined the effect of usage contexts on value of
   information security using an experimental design. Respondents from
   Amazon Mechanical Turk were randomized into one of three conditions in
   which the context of a phishing attack was varied. Respondents were
   asked to make trade-offs between pairs of attributes including security,
   cost, latency, and productivity, from which we could quantify security
   premiums. Results indicated that half of the respondents were willing to
   pay a premium between \$9 and \$11 per month, willing to wait between 8
   and 9 additional minutes, and willing to forgo their access to 21-29
   valid pieces of information, to obtain a more effective phishing filter
   that reduces the number of false negatives from 24 to 6 per month.
   Interestingly, the value of information security was sensitive to the
   usage context, such that social media invoked greater security premiums
   in terms of productivity than email and web surfing. We also found that
   vulnerability and perceived net benefit significantly correlated with
   security premiums in terms of monthly cost. These results offer valuable
   insights for the design of more usable information security systems.},

Abstract = {The use of online messaging systems to exchange information has changed
   due to the ability to share text, video and pictures almost immediately.
   Also it has become an excellent alternative for transmitting data with
   certain reserve levels in places or where voice signals and other forms
   of communication are not of high quality and / or availability, creating
   gaps in critical information security systems. This article describes
   the inherent risk of use messaging applications for transmission of
   classified information, based on user needs, but with a concept of
   organizational use. The analyzed elements are usability, privacy of
   contacts and content, data security, safe storage of information,
   traceability of messages, lifespan of the message, information storage
   encryption protocols and channel codification.
   Because of this, in this project, a survey has been conducted in regards
   to acceptable requirements applicable to these technologies in the work
   sector. This has led to the design of a set of applications from a
   usability standpoint while ensuring adequate and flexible security
   levels. Work completed in this research included aspects of design and
   architecture of a XMPP messaging system, privacy of information, use of
   local databases and storage of information according to relevant
   corporate security policies and agreements, biometric recognition
   systems for authentication encryption protocols.},

Abstract = {The furthermost standard message transfer system used on the internet
   for communication is email. These days spam is a serious concern that
   causes major problems in today's internet. Spam emails are uninhibited
   messages that are sent to a large number of beneficiaries arbitrarily.
   Owing to an overgrowing rise in reputation, the number of unsolicited
   data has also increased promptly and has led to many security concerns.
   Although the sufficient number of spam filtering techniques exists,
   nowadays spammers start discovering innovative practices to escape data
   that are filtered using the spam filters. Spammers use this
   communication source for spreading the malware in the name of an
   executable file. These spam emails waste user's system memory, computing
   power, and bandwidth of the network. Spam emails have been initiated to
   progressively damage the integrity of email and destroy the online
   experience. The research revealed that if the classification algorithms
   are used with feature selection then that will return the exact results
   than the standard classification. In this paper, feature selection is
   done through minimum redundancy and maximum relevance (mRMR) and the
   classification is done by means of Random Forests in the MapReduce
   environment. The performance is compared using various measures, namely
   sensitivity, correctness, and accuracy with the Random Forests in the
   distributed environment using Spambase dataset.},

Abstract = {Over the last few years, with the massive growth of smartphone
   technology and mobile Internet, the use of various online social
   networks (OSNs) have increased rapidly. This ever-growing use of social
   networks leverages cyber-attackers to exploit various phishing schemes,
   spoofed accounts, and other threats to steal users' credentials.
   Phishing is an online crime that employs both technical subterfuge and
   social engineering to steal consumers' personal identity, financial
   account credentials, and other sensitive information. In general, a
   phishing attack is carried out by the exercise of sending fraudulent
   communications (like a fake email with harmful uniform resource
   locators), that pretends to come from a reputable source. The problem of
   designing user authentication protocol for mitigating phishing attacks
   in OSNs is a challenging research problem. In this article, we propose a
   secure and lightweight cryptography-based authentication scheme, called
   authentication scheme for phishing attack (ASPA)-mobile online social
   network (mOSN), that provides resistance to phishing and other related
   attacks in OSNs. The security of the proposed scheme is explained using
   both informal security analysis and formal security analysis through the
   widely recognized real-or-random model and ProVerif simulation tool.
   Finally, we compare the security, functionality, computation, and
   communication costs of the proposed ASPA-mOSN with related schemes. The
   comparison results show that ASPA-mOSN outperforms other existing
   competing schemes.},

Abstract = {Phishing attacks continue to pose a significant threat to online
   security, targeting individuals across various domains. This paper
   presents an investigation into the eye movements differences exhibited
   by individuals with varying levels of computer science experience when
   confronted with phishing attempts. Leveraging advanced eye-tracking
   tools, our study scrutinized the gaze patterns and response strategies
   of computer science experts and novices when exposed to simulated
   phishing email scenarios. Our findings reveal striking disparities in
   the visual and cognitive processing of phishing content between the two
   groups. Computer science experts displayed a heightened vigilance,
   exhibiting more efficient scanning of suspicious elements and quicker
   recognition of phishing indicators. Conversely, novices exhibited longer
   fixation times on deceptive elements and were prone to falling for
   fraudulent schemes. The insights gained from our research hold valuable
   implications for the development of targeted cybersecurity education and
   the design of more effective anti-phishing tools and email clients.},

Abstract = {User perception of phishing threats is fundamental for the uptake and
   effectiveness of many phishing countermeasures, including phishing
   reporting and awareness. Extant research focused on phishing
   victimization, but a clear understanding of the drivers influencing
   users' perception of phishing threats is still missing. This work
   investigates the relationship between phishing cues and perceived email
   deceptiveness through an online questionnaire with 74 participants. By
   assessing email conditions varying on cues, participants judged the
   perceived deceptiveness of emails individually and relative to each
   other. Results reveal that impersonation-related cues increase the
   perceived email deceptiveness and that emails with persuasion-related
   cues rank as the most deceitful irrespectively of other cues. We discuss
   our findings w.r.t. the literature and their implications on practice
   and research.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) allows various embedded devices and smart
   sensors to be connected with each other, which provides a basis for
   building smart cities. The IoT-enabled smart city can greatly benefit
   people's daily lives, where smartphone is one of the most widely used
   IoT devices. For example, people can use the phone to check their
   financial account, store personal data and communicate with peers. Thus
   it is very important to safeguard the phones from unauthorized access.
   To complement traditional textual passwords, touch behavioral
   authentication has attracted much attention while it is still a
   challenge on how to build a robust scheme in practice. This is because
   users' touch actions are often dynamic and hard to model. For this
   challenge, previous work has proved that touch actions could become
   consistent when users interact with social networking applications.
   Motivated by this observation, in this work, we perform a study to
   investigate users' touch behavior within Email applications on
   smartphones (with Email being one of the most important and widely used
   means in connecting with others). The study results with 60 participants
   validate the former observation that users' touch behavioral deviation
   can be greatly decreased when they play Email applications. (c) 2021

Abstract = {E-mail security is a major security concern in today's digital
   communication. Messages have been sent digitally/electronically over the
   network for quite a long time. This has happened around the same time
   when computer networks existed. It's an open fact and we all know that,
   emails have paved and made their way for the internet. In today's
   scenario the users or the e-mail clients have a strong belief that their
   e-mail is private to them and all security measures have been taken to
   incorporate security in them {[}10]. But we should not forget that the
   world of cyberspace is full of crackers. These crackers/sniffers employ
   all sorts of techniques and measures to access various types of data (
   whole of) travelling over the network. As more and more raw and plain
   information about individuals is available electronically in the digital
   world, there has to be alertness and vigilance. Serious need for
   security is required both in form of awareness and countermeasures. The
   omnipresence and network speed of emails have made it increasingly
   effective {[}11]. It has become inevitable and important to provide
   reliance over the email technology. In earlier days the security in
   emails was implemented by encrypting the content. The encrypted content
   was then attached along with the email {[}10]. This approach used to be
   inconvenient for the user and used to make the email bulky by increasing
   the size. In the field of email security, many other systems exist but
   these commercial products are tightly coupled to the email servers and
   web browsers {[}11] and in a way are too specific to a particular
   security feature. To cope up with this issue there is a stringent
   requirement which makes it very important to have a client framework
   which is very secure, highly transparent and at the same time also takes
   care of the security in a web kind of environment. Last but not the
   least such a solution is not tightly coupled to any of the email servers
   existing.},

Abstract = {In 2004 Jones (Jones, 2004) developed a software tool called GmailFS
   that turns Google (TM) Gmail into a two-gigabyte file folder in the
   personal computer. Such virtual folder is not just an interesting
   innovation but quite useful as a back-up depot hosted remotely at
   Google. GmailFS is technically sound but relies critically on the
   hypertext scripts of Gmail web pages. Thus, it can be easily averted by
   the mail server administrator with minor changes of the html scripts or
   web topology. In this paper, we use another approach to achieve the same
   goal of GmailFS and extend the capability to accommodate all email
   servers rather than just Gmail. The proposed system is named ePFS that
   utilizes three primitive email protocols, i.e. SMTP and POP3/IMAP, to
   respectively store and retrieve the data in and from the e-mail servers.
   In addition, we enforce security features of user privacy, data
   confidentiality and error recovery in ePFS. The proposed system is a
   work in progress heading toward a persistent Internet storage for mobile
   applications.},

   This paper proposes an adversarial framework, SpearBot, which utilizes
   LLMs to generate spear-phishing emails with various phishing strategies.
   Through specifically crafted jailbreak prompts, SpearBot circumvents
   security policies and introduces other LLM instances as critics. When a
   phishing email is identified by the critic, SpearBot refines the
   generated email based on the critique feedback until it can no longer be
   recognized as phishing, thereby enhancing its deceptive quality. To
   evaluate the effectiveness of SpearBot, we implement various
   machine-based defenders and assess how well the phishing emails
   generated could deceive them. Results show these emails often evade
   detection to a large extent, underscoring their deceptive quality.
   Additionally, human evaluations of the emails' readability and deception
   are conducted through questionnaires, confirming their convincing nature
   and the significant potential harm of the generated phishing emails.
   Furthermore, we propose a mixup training strategy, which could
   significantly improve the detection of phishing emails in SpearBot.},

Abstract = {Spamming and phishing are two types of emailing that are annoying and
   unwanted, differing by the potential threat and impact to the user.
   Automated classification of these categories can increase the users'
   awareness as well as to be used for incident investigation
   prioritization or automated fact gathering. However, currently there are
   no scientific papers focusing on email classification concerning these
   two categories of spam and phishing emails. Therefore this paper
   presents a solution, based on email message body text automated
   classification into spam and phishing emails. We apply the proposed
   solution for email classification, written in three languages: English,
   Russian, and Lithuanian. As most public email datasets almost
   exclusively collect English emails, we investigate the suitability of
   automated dataset translation to adapt it to email classification,
   written in other languages. Experiments on public dataset usage
   limitations for a specific organization are executed in this paper to
   evaluate the need of dataset updates for more accurate classification
   results.},

Title = {Predicting likelihood of legitimate data loss in email DLP},
Journal = {FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE},

Volume = {110},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The volume and variety of data collected for modern organisations has
   increased significantly over the last decade necessitating the detection
   and prevention of disclosure of sensitive data. Data loss prevention is
   an embedded process used to protect against disclosure of sensitive data
   to external uncontrolled environments. A typical Data Loss Prevention
   (DLP) system uses custom policies to identify and prevent accidental and
   malicious data leakage producing large number of security alerts
   including significant volume of false positives. Consequently,
   identifying legitimate data loss can be very challenging as each
   incident comprises of different characteristics often requiring
   extensive intervention by a domain expert to review alerts individually.
   This limits the ability to detect data loss alerts in real-time making
   organisations vulnerable to financial and reputational damages. The aim
   of this research is to strengthen data loss detection capabilities of a
   DLP system by implementing a machine learning model to predict the
   likelihood of legitimate data loss. We conducted extensive
   experimentation using Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms with
   historical email incident data collected by a globally established
   telecommunication enterprise. The final model produced with Random
   Forest algorithm was identified as the most effective as it was
   successfully able to predict approximately 95\% data loss incidents
   accurately with an average true positive value of 90\%. Furthermore, the
   proposed solution successfully enables identification of legitimate data
   loss in email DLP whilst facilitating prioritisation of real data loss
   through human-understandable explanation of the decision thereby
   improving the efficiency of the process. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {User compliance and remediation success after IoT malware notifications},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CYBERSECURITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are getting involved in remediating
   Internet of Things (IoT) infections of end users. This endeavor runs
   into serious usability problems. Given that it is usually unknown what
   kind of device is infected, they can only provide users with very
   generic cleanup advice, trying to cover all device types and remediation
   paths. Does this advice work? To what extent do users comply with the
   instructions? And does more compliance lead to higher cleanup rates?
   This study is the first to shed light on these questions. In partnership
   with an ISP, we designed a randomized control experiment followed up by
   a user survey. We randomly assigned 177 consumers affected by malware
   from the Mirai family to three different groups: (i) notified via a
   walled garden (quarantine network), (ii) notified via email, and (iii)
   no immediate notification, i.e. a control group. The notification asks
   the user to take five steps to remediate the infection. We conducted a
   phone survey with 95 of these customers based on communication-human
   information processing theory. We model the impact of the treatment,
   comprehension, and motivation on the compliance rate of each customer,
   while controlling for differences in demographics and infected device
   types. We also estimate the extent to which compliance leads to
   successful cleanup of the infected IoT devices. While only 24\% of
   notified users perform all five remediation steps, 92\% of notified
   users perform at least one action. Compliance increases the probability
   of successful cleanup by 32\%, while the presence of competing malware
   reduces it by 54\%. We provide an empirical basis to shape ISP best
   practices in the fight against IoT malware.},

Abstract = {Challenge-response mechanisms have become widely adopted as a means of
   user verification. In this process, users are required to provide a set
   of challenge questions, with their actual answers serving as a means to
   authenticate the user's identity. Despite the widespread usability of
   challenge-response as an authentication mechanism, it remains vulnerable
   to evasion by attackers who can employ social engineering tactics or
   gather information to guess or steal the necessary credentials.
   To address this inherent challenge, this paper presents a novel
   technique for dynamically generating challenge-response questions based
   on authentic historical interactions, such as daily communication via
   email or messaging platforms. We developed deep learning models,
   utilizing language models such as BERT, and employed semantic analysis
   to extract and validate highly usable challenge-response questions.
   These questions are designed to be easily answerable by legitimate users
   while presenting an unpredictable challenge to potential attackers.
   As an effective use case demonstration for our proposed system, we
   developed an email sender verification system capable of real-time
   identification of suspicious email senders. This system prompts the
   senders with carefully crafted challenge questions based on previous
   email exchanges with authentic users, enabling the identification of
   advanced spear-phishing emails that would otherwise remain undetected.
   We evaluated the effectiveness of our system, named VeriActor, through
   the use of annotated datasets and a user study. The experimental results
   exhibited promising outcomes, with a verification accuracy of 87.8\% and
   a protection accuracy of 83.33\%.},

Abstract = {A person's online security setup is tied to the security of their

   method to gather and analyse users' online accounts systematically. We
   demonstrate this in a user study with 20 participants and obtain
   detailed insights on how users' personal setup choices and behaviours
   affect their overall account security. We discuss concrete usability and

Abstract = {There has been a rapid increase in the use of cloud email services. As a
   result, email encryption has become more commonplace as concerns about
   cloud privacy and security grow. Nevertheless, this increase in usage is
   creating the challenge of how to effectively be searching and filtering
   the encrypted emails. They are popular technologies of solving the issue
   of the encrypted emails searching through searchable public key
   encryption. However, the problem of encrypted email filtering remains to
   be solved. As a new approach to finding and filtering encrypted emails
   in the cloud, we propose a ciphertext-based encrypted policy
   attribute-based encryption scheme and keyword search procedure based on
   hidden policy ciphertext. This feature allows the user of searching
   using some encrypted emails keywords in the cloud as well as allowing
   the emails filter-based server toward filter the content of the
   encrypted emails, similar to the traditional email keyword filtering
   service. By utilizing composite order bilinear groups, a hidden policy
   system has been successfully demonstrated to be secure by our dual
   system encryption process. Proposed system can be used with other
   scenarios such as searching and filtering files as an applicable method.},

Title = {Efficient defense strategy against spam and phishing email: An
   evolutionary game model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {61},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Spam and phishing emails are never-ending problems, and they are
   increasingly distributed with the help of the botnet. Existing spam and
   phishing email defense depends heavily on the spam filtering technique.
   However, using the spam filtering technique needs many defensive
   resources, which are usually limited. Therefore, to achieve the maximum
   effect with limited defense resources, we answer the following questions
   in this paper: How many user nodes we should protect in a target
   network? What factors affect this and how? To solve these problems, we
   propose an evolutional game model between multiple attackers and
   multiple defenders and analyze the evolution process of their
   strategies. The optimal number of users protected is first obtained as
   an efficient defense strategy, which can reduce resource consumption and
   lower attack density. Then we discover that this defense strategy is
   affected by the email opening probability of users, the attack cost, and
   the attack loss. Our results can help email network managers deploy the
   spam filtering technique according to the email opening probability, of
   which the defender has an asymmetric information advantage. Furthermore,
   we study the influences of the attack cost and loss on the defense
   strategy. It is revealed that the attack cost has a more marked effect
   on the defense strategy compared to the attack loss. Finally, we
   experiment on a large real-world dataset of emails sent in 2-year time
   duration. The defense strategy is proven to be effective for maximizing
   defense resources.},

Abstract = {Email worms remain a major network security concern, as they
   increasingly attack systems with intensity using more advanced social
   engineering tricks. Their extremely high prevalence clearly indicates
   that current network defence mechanisms are intrinsically incapable of
   mitigating email worms, and thereby reducing unwanted email traffic
   traversing the Internet. In this paper we study the effect email worms
   have on the flow-level characteristics of DNS query streams a user
   machine generates. We propose a method based on unsupervised learning
   and time series analysis to early detect email worms on the local name
   server, which is located topologically near the infected machine. We
   evaluate our method against an email worm DNS query stream dataset that
   consists of 68 email worm instances and show that it exhibits remarkable
   accuracy in detecting various email worm instances(1).},

Abstract = {Nowadays email clients which support encryption and signature are mostly
   based on PKI system. The troubles introduced by the certificates bring a
   lot of inconvenience to users. Identity based encryption (IBE) is an
   asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that uses a user's unique identity as
   the public key, so that the troubles of exchanging and distributing
   public keys are avoided. However, the present standard applications do
   not support the IBE algorithm. To address this issue, we come up with
   the pseudo RSA digital certificate technology, which stores an IBE key
   in the RSA key structure of a certificate, and put forward a scheme of
   using an IBE plug-in component to implement the IBE functionality for
   the Outlook and Thunderbird.},

   support of the human factors in communication.  MHS is evaluated in
   terms of its suitability for the individual user and the applicability
   for communication in groups.  Message handling services are presented
   and compared with user requirements.  In particular, the new services of
   the X.400 recommendations of 1988 concerning interworking with Directory
   Services (DS), the security model, message store and distribution lists
   are examined to determine how they meet the needs of the human user, and

Abstract = {Several previous studies have investigated user susceptibility to
   phishing attacks. A thorough meta-analysis or systematic review is
   required to gain a better understanding of these findings and to assess
   the strength of evidence for phishing susceptibility of a subpopulation,
   e.g., older users. We aim to determine whether an effect exists; another
   aim is to determine whether the effect is positive or negative and to
   obtain a single summary estimate of the effect. OBJECTIVES: We
   systematically review the results of previous user studies on phishing
   susceptibility and conduct a meta-analysis. METHOD: We searched four
   online databases for English studies on phishing. We included all user
   studies in phishing detection and prevention, whether they proposed new
   training techniques or analyzed users' vulnerability. FINDINGS: A
   careful analysis reveals some discrepancies between the findings. More
   than half of the studies that analyzed the effect of age reported no
   statistically significant relationship between age and users'
   performance. Some studies reported older people performed better while
   some reported the opposite. A similar finding holds for the gender
   difference. The meta-analysis shows: 1) a significant relationship
   between participants' age and their susceptibility 2) females are more
   susceptible than males 3) users training significantly improves their
   detection ability.},

Abstract = {Fallback authentication is the backup authentication method used when
   the primary authentication method (e.g., passwords, biometrics, etc.)
   fails. Currently, widely-deployed fallback authentication methods (e.g.,
   security questions, email resets, and SMS resets) suffer from documented
   security and usability flaws that threaten the security of accounts.
   These flaws motivate us to design and study Geographical Security
   Questions (GeoSQ), a system for fallback authentication. GeoSQ is an
   Android application that utilizes autobiographical location data for
   fallback authentication. We performed security and usability analyses of
   GeoSQ through an in-person two-session lab study (n=36, 18 pairs). Our
   results indicate that GeoSQ exceeds the security of its counterparts,
   while its usability (specifically login time and memorability) has room
   for improvement.},

Abstract = {OpenPGP and S/MIME are the two prime standards for providing end-to-end
   security for emails. We describe novel attacks built upon a technique we
   call malleability gadgets to reveal the plaintext of encrypted emails.
   We use CBC/CFB gadgets to inject malicious plaintext snippets into
   encrypted emails. These snippets abuse existing and standard conforming
   backchannels to exfiltrate the full plaintext after decryption. We
   describe malleability gadgets for emails using HTML, CSS, and X.509
   functionality. The attack works for emails even if they were collected
   long ago, and it is triggered as soon as the recipient decrypts a single
   maliciously crafted email from the attacker.
   We devise working attacks for both OpenPGP and S/MIME encryption, and
   show that exfiltration channels exist for 23 of the 35 tested S/MIME
   email clients and 10 of the 28 tested OpenPGP email clients. While it is
   advisable to update the OpenPGP and S/MIME standards to fix these
   vulnerabilities, some clients had even more severe implementation flaws
   allowing straightforward exfiltration of the plaintext.},

Title = {Participant-Centered Online Active Surveillance for Adverse Events
   Following Vaccination in a Large Clinical Trial: Feasibility and
   Usability Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 23},
Abstract = {Background: Active participant monitoring of adverse events following
   immunization (AEFI) is a recent development to improve the speed and
   transparency of vaccine safety postmarketing. Vaxtracker, an online tool
   used to monitor vaccine safety, has successfully demonstrated its
   usefulness in postmarketing surveillance of newly introduced childhood
   vaccines. However, its use in older participants, or for monitoring
   patients participating in large clinical trials, has not been evaluated.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to monitor AEFIs in older
   participants enrolled in the Australian Study for the Prevention through
   the Immunisation of Cardiovascular Events (AUSPICE) trial, and to
   evaluate the usefulness and effectiveness of Vaxtracker in this research
   setting.
   Methods: AUSPICE is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled,
   double-blinded trial in which participants aged 55 to 61 years were
   given either the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23vPPV) or 0.9\%
   saline placebo. Vaxtracker was used to monitor AEFIs in participants in
   either treatment arm through the administration of two online
   questionnaires. A link to each questionnaire was sent to participants
   via email or short message service (SMS) text message 7 and 28 days
   following vaccination. Data were collated and analyzed in near-real time
   to identify any possible safety signals indicating problems with the
   vaccine or placebo.
   Results: All 4725 AUSPICE participants were enrolled in Vaxtracker.
   Participant response rates for the first and final survey were 96.47\%
   (n=4558) and 96.65\% (n=4525), respectively. The online survey was
   completed by 90.23\% (4083/4525) of Vaxtracker participants within 3
   days of receiving the link. AEFIs were reported by 34.40\% (805/2340) of
   23vPPV recipients and 10.29\% (240/2332) of placebo recipients in the 7
   days following vaccination. Dominant symptoms for vaccine and placebo
   recipients were pain at the injection site (587/2340, 25.09\%) and
   fatigue (103/2332, 4.42\%), respectively. Females were more likely to
   report symptoms following vaccination with 23vPPV compared with males
   (433/1138, 38.05\% versus 372/1202, 30.95\%; P<.001).
   Conclusions: Vaxtracker is an effective tool for monitoring AEFIs in the
   55 to 61 years age group. Participant response rates were high for both
   surveys, in both treatment arms and for each method of sending the
   survey. This study indicates that administration of 23vPPV was
   well-tolerated in this cohort. Vaxtracker has successfully demonstrated
   its application in the monitoring of adverse events in near-real time
   following vaccination in people participating in a national clinical
   trial.},

Abstract = {Email is currently one of the services most affected by the security
   problems that proliferate on both the Internet and in local networks or
   intranet. Specialists in telematic services have the great challenge of
   providing an email service that guarantees its stability and
   availability, as well as minimizing the risks of identity theft,
   unwanted emails, and so-called spam emails. The objective of this
   research is to carry out an analysis of the main security problems that
   proliferate in this service and to describe a set of good practices for
   a secure configuration and deployment of the email service, which, in
   turn, contributes to reducing the security problems associated with this
   service and consequently achieving greater user satisfaction.},

Abstract = {Introduction This article draws attention to the need for open
   evaluation and reporting on safety protocols in survey and intervention
   research. We describe a protocol for responding to those who indicate
   increased risk of self-harm (i.e. suicidality or potentially lethal
   alcohol use) as an example and report on the outcome of our procedures.
   Methods Participants were first-year college students (n = 891)
   participating in an intervention trial for binge drinking. We describe
   the protocol, provide descriptive outcomes, and examine whether
   participant sex, attrition, or study intervention condition were related
   to endorsing items that indicated risk for suicidality or potentially
   lethal alcohol use. Results Of the 891 participants, 167 (18.7\%) were
   identified as being at risk in one or more study wave. Of those, we were
   able to successfully contact 100 (59.9\%), 76 (45.5\%) by phone, and 24
   (14.4\%) by email. Of those 100, 78 accepted mental health resources as
   a result of outreach. Participant sex, attrition, and intervention
   condition were not related to risk. Discussion This article may aid
   other research teams in developing similar protocols. Strategies to
   reach an even greater proportion of high-risk participants are needed. A
   body of literature documenting published safety protocols in research
   and the associated outcomes would help to identify opportunities for
   improvement.},

Abstract = {Disaster is an attempt to control or access the system without
   legal/valid permission and proper authorization protocol from legitimate
   entity. Nowadays, most organizations managed to save records in an
   online database transmitted over unpredictable network. To gain access
   to the system it is better if proper authentication be placed because it
   may affect the organization operation and sensitive information may be
   at risk (like early warning notification, casualty monitoring, initial
   and post assessment, rescue operation, response recovery, etc) if system
   has been compromised. This paper introduced a new scheme of one time
   password (OTP) email-based authentication and improved the
   authentication scheme using middle square technique to protect and
   secure confidential information for disaster management system. The
   One-Time Password has been recognized by many organizations as a
   breakthrough to two-factor authentication technique. It solves the
   shortcomings of the traditional username/password authentication. The
   OTP generates the initial seed based from the combination of several
   parameters like string of characters, numbers, date, time and weather
   data (humidity and temperature). The values generated changes overtime
   upon login registration as it extract location weather data producing an
   approximately 91 possible values or 4,095 possible combinations. The
   application has primary components namely: about, signup and login. It
   authenticates the user up to three (3) login attempts only then follows
   the redirection process. This scheme improved the security, protection
   and confidence level of the user as it uses a randomized generation of
   OTP codes sent through secured email account that is free from brute
   force, dictionary attack, insider attack, and key-logger attacks.},

Abstract = {In the era of Industry 4.0 (IR 4.0), information leakage has become a
   critical issue for information security. The basic approach to
   addressing information leakage threats is to implement an information
   security policy (ISP) that defines the standards, boundaries, and
   responsibilities of users of information and technology of an
   organization. ISPs are one of the most commonly used methods for
   controlling internal user security behaviours, which include, but not
   limited to, computer usage ethics; organizational system usage policies;
   Internet and email usage policies; and the use of social media. Human
   error is the main security threat to information security, resulting
   from negligence, ignorance, and failure to adhere to organizational
   information security policies. Information security incidents are a
   problem related to human behaviour because technology is designed and
   operated by humans, presenting the opportunities and spaces for human
   error. In addition to the factor of human error as the main source of
   information leakage, this study aims to systematically analyse the
   fundamental issues of information security policy compliance. An
   analysis of these papers identifies and categories critical factor that
   effect an employee's attitude toward compliance with ISP. The human,
   process, technology element and information governance should be thought
   as a significant scope for more efficiency of information security
   policy compliance and in any further extensive studies to improve on
   information security policy compliance. Therefore, to ensure these are
   properly understood, further study is needed to identity the information
   governance that needs to be included in organizations and current best
   practices for developing an information security policy compliance
   within organizations.},

Abstract = {Anti-malware software must be frequently updated in order to protect the
   system and the user from attack. Makers of this software must choose
   between interrupting the user to update immediately or allowing them to
   update later. In either case, assessing the content of the interruption
   may still require cognitive investment. However, by allowing the user to
   negotiate a delayed response to these interruptions, users can instead
   focus on their work. This paper experimentally examines the effect of
   immediate and negotiated interruptions on user decision time and
   decision accuracy in multiple stage tasks. For complex tasks, decision
   performance is higher when the user can negotiate the onset of and
   response to interruptions. The option to defer response also results in
   greater subjective perceptions of control, improved task resumption and
   reduced feelings of interruption and distraction on the part of the
   user, even within a short period of time. These findings have practical
   implications for endpoint security and where there is a need to mitigate
   the effects of user interruptions from computer-mediated communication
   in complex task situations.},

Abstract = {We focus on email-based attacks, a rich field with well-publicized
   consequences. We show how current Natural Language Generation (NLG)
   technology allows an attacker to generate masquerade attacks on scale,
   and study their effectiveness with a within-subjects study. We also
   gather insights on what parts of an email do users focus on and how
   users identify attacks in this realm, by planting signals and also by
   asking them for their reasoning. We find that: (i) 17\% of participants
   could not identify any of the signals that were inserted in entrails,
   and (ii) Participants were unable to perform better than random guessing
   on these attacks. The insights gathered and the tools and techniques
   employed could help defenders in: (i) implementing new, customized
   anti-phishing solutions for Internet users including training
   next-generation email filters that go beyond vanilla spam filters and
   capable of addressing masquerade, (ii) more effectively training and
   upgrading the skills of email users, and (iii) understanding the
   dynamics of this novel attack and its ability of tricking humans.},

Abstract = {Certified email is a system which enables a sender to prove a receiver's
   receipt of email. Such a system can be used for applications related to
   electronic commerce on the Internet. This paper considers a situation
   where a sender or a receiver wants to change his/her mind due to the
   change of mail content value (e.g., stock, auction, gambling) during the
   transaction. We point out that no traditional certified email systems
   have been designed for such a case, thus one of the participants can be
   at a disadvantage. To avoid this problem, we propose an evenhanded
   certified email system in which each participant can change his/her
   choice, either cancel or finish the transaction, at any time during the
   transaction.},

Abstract = {We show practical attacks against OpenPGP and S/MIME encryption and
   digital signatures in the context of email. Instead of targeting the
   underlying cryptographic primitives, our attacks abuse legitimate
   features of the MIME standard and HTML, as supported by email clients,
   to deceive the user regarding the actual message content. We demonstrate
   how the attacker can unknowingly abuse the user as a decryption oracle
   by replying to an unsuspicious looking email. Using this technique, the
   plaintext of hundreds of encrypted emails can be leaked at once.
   Furthermore, we show how users could be tricked into signing arbitrary
   text by replying to emails containing CSS conditional rules. An
   evaluation shows that 17 out of 19 OpenPGP-capable email clients, as
   well as 21 out of 22 clients supporting S/MIME, are vulnerable to at
   least one attack. We provide different countermeasures and discuss their
   advantages and disadvantages.},

Abstract = {In the modern age of Internet connectivity, advanced information systems
   have accumulated huge volumes of data. Such fast growing, tremendous
   amount of data, collected and stored in large databases has far exceeded
   our human ability to comprehend without proper tools. There has been a
   great deal of research conducted to explore the potential applications
   of Machine Learning technologies in Security Informatics. This article
   studies the Network Security Detection problems in which predictive
   models are constructed to detect network security breaches such as
   spamming. Due to overwhelming volume of data, complexity and dynamics of
   computer networks and evolving cyber threats, current security systems
   suffer limited performance with low detection accuracy and high number
   of false alarms. To address such performance issues, a novel Machine
   Learning algorithm, namely Boosted Subspace Probabilistic Neural Network
   (BSPNN), has been proposed which combines a Radial Basis Function Neural
   Network with an innovative diversity-based ensemble learning framework.
   Extensive empirical analyses suggested that BSPNN achieved high
   detection accuracy with relatively small computational complexity
   compared with other conventional detection methods.},

Abstract = {The increasing centralization of networked services places user data at
   considerable risk. For example, many users store email on remote servers
   rather than on their local disk. Doing so allows users to gain the
   benefit of regular backups and remote access, but it also places a great
   deal of unwarranted trust in the server Since most email is stored in
   plaintext, a compromise of the server implies the loss of
   confidentiality and integrity of the email stored therein. Although
   users could employ an end-to-end encryption scheme (e.g., PGP), such
   measures are not widely adopted, require action on the sender side, only
   provide partial protection (the email headers remain in the clear), and
   prevent the users from performing some common operations, such as
   server-side search.
   To address this problem, we present Secure Searchable Automated Remote
   Email Storage (SSARES), a novel system that offers a practical approach
   to both securing remotely stored email and allowing privacy-preserving
   search of that email collection. Our solution encrypts email (the
   headers, body, and attachments) as it arrives on the server using
   public-key encryption. SSARES uses a combination of Identity Based
   Encryption and Bloom Filters to create a searchable index. This index
   reveals little information about search keywords and queries, even
   against adversaries that compromise the server SSARES remains largely
   transparent to both the sender and recipient.},

Title = {Email fraud: The search for psychological predictors of susceptibility},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 16},
Abstract = {Decisions that we make about email legitimacy can result in a pernicious
   threat to security of both individuals and organisations. Yet user
   response to phishing emails is far from uniform; some respond while
   others do not. What is the source of this diversity in decision-making?
   From a psychological perspective, we consider cognitive and situational
   influences that might explain why certain users are more susceptible
   than others. Alongside an email judgment task employed as a proxy for
   fraud susceptibility, 224 participants completed a range of cognitive
   tasks. In addition, we manipulated time pressure for email legitimacy
   judgments. We identify cognitive reflection and sensation seeking as
   significant, albeit modest, predictors of susceptibility. Further to
   this, participants asked to make quicker responses made more judgment
   errors. We conclude there are cognitive signatures that partially
   contribute to email fraud susceptibility, with implications for efforts
   to limit online security breaches and train secure behaviors.},

Title = {Social Media Users Send Promotional Links to Strangers: Legitimate
   Promotion or Security Vulnerability?},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {41705-41718},
Abstract = {Nowadays, many users make money by publishing content on social media
   platforms. In order to attract users' attention, they often take
   measures to promote themselves. The security vulnerabilities in social
   media platforms may provide convenience for their user promotion work.
   We call this type of vulnerability the user promotion security
   vulnerability (UPSV). UPSV may cause unfair competition and endanger the
   interests of legitimate users and the social media platforms. Therefore
   it has great research significance to find and fix this vulnerability.
   In this paper, we propose a UPSV which widely exists in the function of
   sending messages to strangers of in-app chatting of many social media
   platforms. We first analyzed this vulnerability in some apps, and then
   YY app (China's largest live streaming platform) was chosen as the
   research object to verify the actual effect of the vulnerability on
   illegitimate user promotion. We took the method of promoting a target YY
   streamer through sending promotional links to viewers, and to improve
   promotion effect, we used the method of user preference learning to
   select viewers for promotion. The experimental results show that among
   the promoted viewers, more than 44\% entered the target streamers'
   channels to watch live streaming, more than 21\% followed the target
   steamers, and more than 13\% gave gifts to the target steamers. It fully
   proves that this UPSV is real, exploitable and harmful, and we also
   proposed some fix suggestions to help the platforms to fix it.},

Abstract = {Research in the context of user awareness has shown that smart-home
   occupants often lack cybersecurity awareness even when it comes to
   frequently used technologies such as online social networks and email.
   To cope with the risks, smart-homes must be equipped with adequate
   cybersecurity measures besides the knowledge and time required by
   smarthome occupants to implement security measures. In this paper, we
   explore potential threats in AI-powered smart-homes and identify a list
   of cybersecurity controls required to mitigate their potential impact
   considering attack vectors, as well as the time and knowledge required
   to implement a control. We use optimisation to identify the best set of
   controls to minimise the risk exposure considering these metrics. Our
   comparative analysis against a random selection approach highlight that
   our approach is at least 25\% better at minimising risk. Finally, we
   show how improved knowledge or time impacts the risk.},

Abstract = {The conditional proxy broadcast ReEncryption mechanism enables the user
   to periodically re-encrypt the cipher-text. When a sender generates the
   key, ReEncryption id, which reuses for the encrypted data or the
   ciphertext. Two methods that only allow one recipient at a time are
   proxy ReEncryption and identity-based proxy ReEncryption. If there are
   multiple receivers, these systems need to be called numerous times,
   which is a significant drawback. To overcome this problem of a single
   receiver, proposed a new scheme, blockchain-based broadcast proxy
   ReEncryption (BBPRE), which allows the system to handle multiple
   receivers at a time. This BBPRE works similar to the proxy ReEncryption
   and identity-based proxy ReEncryption but allows multiple receivers and
   adds the time property. In this broadcast proxy ReEncryption, a
   sender/user can able to send ciphertext or encrypted to multiple
   receivers at a time, and all the receivers also have an encryption key
   provided by the sender/user.The receivers can able to re-encrypt this
   encrypted data or the ciphertext. It provides security to the user files
   during sending and sharing through electronic mail. The time stamp
   authority creates a public key, each period that has the most recent
   timestamp for every user.},

Abstract = {Lawyers and investigators are often presented with large email datasets
   that contain emails that are not all relevant to any given investigative
   search. They must often manually comb through information contained
   within these large datasets in order to find the information they need,
   expending large amounts of time and money in the process. Our work
   offers an interactive visual analytic alternative to current
   methodology. We introduce a method for reducing the number of emails
   that need to be viewed in a large dataset while also giving the user a
   quick overview of possible contents and relationships in a set of
   results.},

Abstract = {Email has become the critical communication medium for most
   organizations. Unfortunately, email-born attacks in computer networks
   are causing considerable economic losses worldwide. Exiting phishing
   email blocking appliances have little effect in weeding out the vast
   majority of phishing emails. At the same time, online criminals are
   becoming more dangerous and sophisticated. Phishing emails are more
   active than ever before and putting the average computer user and
   organizations at risk,of significant data, brand and financial loss. In
   this paper, we propose a hybrid feature selection approach based on
   combination of content-based and behaviour-based. The approach could
   mine the attacker behaviour based on email header. On a publicly
   available test corpus, our hybrid features selection is able to achieve
   94\% accuracy rate.},

Abstract = {Over 80 million households in the United States have a home computer and
   an Internet connection. The vast majority of these are administered by
   people who have little computer security knowledge or training, and many
   users try to avoid making security decisions because they feel they
   don't have the knowledge and skills to maintain proper security.
   Nevertheless, home computer users still make security-related decisions
   on a regular basis for example, whether or not to click on a shady link
   in an email message without even knowing that's what they are doing.
   Their decisions are guided by how they think about computer security, or
   their ``mental models,{''} which do not have to be technically correct
   to lead to desirable security behaviors {[}44]. In other words,
   sometimes even ``wrong{''} mental models produce good security
   decisions. By eliminating the constraint that nontechnical users must
   become more like computer security experts to properly protect
   themselves, we believe that we can create more effective ways of helping
   home computer users make good security decisions. To that end, we
   propose a research agenda that will help us learn how to shape the
   mental models of regular non-technical computer users.},

Abstract = {CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and
   Humans Apart) is a simple test that is easy for humans but extremely
   difficult for computers to solve. CAPTCHA has been widely used in
   commercial websites such as web-based email providers, TicketMaster,
   GoDaddy, and Facebook to protect their resources from attacks initiated
   by automatic scripts. By design, CAPTCHA is unable to distinguish
   between a human attacker and a legitimate human user. This leaves
   websites using CAPTCHA vulnerable to 3rd party human CAPTCHA attacks. In
   order to demonstrate the vulnerabilities in existing CAPTCHA
   technologies we develop a new streamlined human-based CAPTCHA attack
   that uses Instant Messenger infrastructure. Facing this serious
   human-based attack threat, we then present a new defense system called
   Interactive CAPTCHA (iCAPTCHA), which is the next generation of CAPTCHA
   technology providing the first steps toward defending against 3rd party
   human CAPTCHA attacks. iCAPTCHA requires a user to solve a CAPTCHA test
   via a series of user interactions. The multi-step back-and-forth traffic
   between client and server amplifies the statistical timing difference
   between a legitimate user and a human solver, which enables better
   attack detection performance. A performance and usability study of
   iCAPTCHA shows the proposed scheme is effective in attack detection, is
   easy to use, and is a viable replacement of the current text-based
   CAPTCHA.},

Abstract = {To prevent resource (especially storage) shortage, information systems
   such as storage services and email services usually impose an upper
   bound of resource consumption (quota) per user. In a conservative way,
   an administrator tends to set a quota value such as the storage capacity
   divided by the expected maximum number of users for safety and fairness,
   but it tends to leave large unused storage space, because the users'
   storage usage pattern shows a long-tailed distribution. In this paper,
   we analyzed storage usage distribution of some email services to
   approximate the distribution using a power-law distribution, and
   proposed a method to calculate an optimal quota value from a target size
   of storage consumption to increase storage utilization. We applied an
   optimal quota value we calculated to a real email service and analyzed
   the effect of quota change. Then, we analyzed actual distributions
   further to find a better model to approximate the distribution, and
   found that a log-normal distribution explained the distribution better
   than power-law. We also analyzed two other universities' email service
   to find similar distribution in these systems.},

Title = {Enhancing Phishing Defenses: The Impact of Timing and Explanations in
   Warnings for Email Clients},
Journal = {COMPUTER STANDARDS \& INTERFACES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {93},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Phishing attacks continue to represent a significant risk to digital
   security due to their reliance on exploiting human vulnerabilities
   before those of computer systems. To try to limit the effectiveness of
   this threat, this paper explores new strategies to design warnings shown
   to users in the presence of suspicious phishing emails. A controlled
   experiment was conducted with 900 participants to investigate the impact
   of two factors on warning effectiveness: the warning activation timing
   (before or after the opening of an email) and the presence of
   explanation messages in the warning. The study results indicate that
   warnings displayed after users have read the content of the email
   significantly reduce click-through rates, demonstrating greater
   effectiveness in preventing phishing. Furthermore, the presence of
   explanations also determined a lower click-through rate. Nevertheless,
   displaying warnings without explanation and simpler warnings for false
   positive emails may be necessary. The details of these findings were
   presented as lessons learned that can drive the design of more effective
   warning systems.},

Abstract = {The conventional design of home security systems typically monitors only
   the property and lacks physical control aspects of the house itself.
   Also, the term security is not well defined because there is a time
   delay between the alarm system going on and actual arrival of the
   security personnel. This paper discusses the development of a home
   security and monitoring system that works where the traditional security
   systems that are mainly concerned about curbing burglary and gathering
   evidence against trespassing fail. The paper presents the design and
   implementation details of this new home control and security system
   based on field programmable gate array (FPGA) The user here can interact
   directly with the system through a web-based interface over the
   Internet, while home appliances like air conditioners, lights, door
   locks and gates are remotely controlled through a user-friendly web
   page. An additional feature that enhances the security aspect of the
   system is its capability of monitoring entry points such as doors and
   windows so that in the event any breach, an alerting email message is
   sent to the home owner instantly.},

Title = {Digital Workplaces and Information Security Behavior of Business
   Employees: An Empirical Study of Saudi Arabia},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {In the post pandemic era, the telecommuting of business employees has
   widely become acceptable in organizations, which demands extensive
   dependence on digital technologies. In addition, this poses additional
   security threats for business employees as well as organizations. In
   order to better respond to security threats, business employees must
   have a higher level of awareness of the potential threats that are
   relevant to digital infrastructure used within the workplace. In this
   paper, we present a quantitative study conducted in line with the theory
   of planned behavior to gain insight into employee behavior toward
   information security within different business sectors in Saudi Arabia.
   The key factors chosen for our model were password management,
   infrastructure security management, email management, organizational
   security policy, organizational support and training, and the perception
   of the level of security. We have applied structured equation modelling
   to identify most of the relevant factors based on the respondents'
   feedback. The results based on the business employee behavior showed
   that they respondents did not perceive all of the constructs of our
   model as relevant security factors, which can potentially result in
   security lapses. This indicates that more security-related measures
   should be put in place and that business employees should be updated
   periodically about potential security threats. To this effect, we
   divided the studied security measures into those which should be
   implemented at organizational and individual levels. The results will
   potentially help business managers to design appropriate security
   trainings, guidelines, and policies for their employees to ensure more
   information security awareness and protect their technological
   infrastructure, especially within home office environments.},

Abstract = {Email worms and the high amount of unsolicited email traffic on the
   Internet continue to be persistent operational security issues. In this
   work, we present a method to detect email worms soon after they appear
   at the local name server which is topologically near the infected
   machines. Our method analyses at flow level the communication patterns
   between user machines and the local name server With respect to this, it
   uses exact similarity search over time series produced by the Domain
   Name System (DNS) query streams of user machines, and unsupervised
   learning. To evaluate our method, we have constructed and used a DNS
   query dataset that consists of 71 recent email worms. We demonstrate
   that our method is remarkably effective in the long run, and that time
   series similarity search can be a useful tool for intrusion detection,
   one that has not yet been adequately explored.},

Abstract = {The Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) algorithm is a 2FA method that
   is widely deployed because of its relatively low implementation costs
   and purported security benefits over SMS 2FA. However, users of TOTP 2FA
   apps face a critical usability challenge: maintain access to the secrets
   stored within the TOTP app, or risk getting locked out of their
   accounts. To help users avoid this fate, popular TOTP apps implement a
   wide range of backup mechanisms, each with varying security and privacy
   implications. In this paper, we define an assessment methodology for
   conducting systematic security and privacy analyses of the backup and
   recovery functionality of TOTP apps. We identified all general purpose
   Android TOTP apps in the Google Play Store with at least 100k installs
   that implemented a backup mechanism (n = 22). Our findings show that
   most backup strategies end up placing trust in the same technologies
   that TOTP 2FA is meant to supersede: passwords, SMS, and email. Many
   backup implementations shared personal user information with third
   parties, had serious cryptographic flaws, and/or allowed the app
   developers to access the TOTP secrets in plaintext. We present our
   findings and recommend ways to improve the security and privacy of TOTP
   2FA app backup mechanisms.},

Abstract = {The paper aims at investigating computational intelligence methodologies
   for detecting a change in communication behavioral patterns between
   e-mail subscribers. This change may indicate a change of social status
   and behavior, which could be used for early discovery of some
   preparation to antisocial activity, including but not limiting to
   terrorist attacks. The patterns in the social interactions or contacts
   between people by e-mail can be analyzed using social network analysis
   and user behavior analysis. In this paper we provide a review of the
   work related to the areas of dynamic modeling and link prediction of
   social networks, and anomaly detection for detecting changes in the
   behavior of e-mail usage. The feasibility of neural networks and fuzzy
   logic methodologies applications for a change detection system design is
   discussed, as well as a discussion about an e-mail simulation model
   currently being developed.},

Abstract = {We propose a framework that uses environment information to enhance
   computer security. We apply our framework to: enhance IDS performance;
   and to enrich the expressiveness of access/rate controls. The
   environment information is gathered by external (w.r.t the host)
   sensors, and transmitted via an out-of-band channel, and thus it is hard
   for adversaries not having physical access to compromise the system. The
   information gathered still remains intact even if malware use rootkit
   techniques to hide its activities. Due to requirements on user privacy,
   the information gathered could be coarse and simple. We show that such
   simple information is already useful in several experimental
   evaluations. For instance, binary user presence indicating at a
   workstation can help to detect DDoS zombie attacks and illegal email
   spam. Our framework takes advantage of the growing popularity of
   multimodal sensors and physical security information management systems.
   Trends in sensor costs suggest that it will be cost-effective in the
   near future.},

Abstract = {Digital twin plays an important role in safety monitoring of typical
   industrial workspaces such as substations. In the digital twin of a
   workspace, localizing and tracking the workers provide an intuitive way
   for updating their status. This paper proposes a visual human
   localization and safe monitoring method in a digital twin of workspace.
   In this paper, a 3D scanning model of the realistic workspace is
   utilized as its digital twin model, instead of a CAD model. The camera
   can be quickly calibrated with the digital twin by selecting a small
   number of paired 2D and 3D matching points. The pixel coordinate of
   human feet detected by the deep learning algorithm is mapped into the
   digital twin, and the human position is updated dynamically. A typical
   application of virtual electronic fence is developed based on the human
   localization results. The experimental results show that the calibration
   method is fast and effective, and the performance of human localization
   can meet the requirements of product management and safety monitoring.},

   Secrecy},

Abstract = {With the widespread use of cloud emails and frequent reports on
   large-scale email leakage events, a security property so-called forward
   secrecy becomes desirable and indispensable for both individuals and
   cloud email service providers to strengthen the security of cloud email
   systems. Specifically, forward secrecy can guarantee the confidentiality
   of those previously encrypted emails even if the user's secret key gets
   exposed. However, due to the failure to meet the security and
   practicality requirements of email systems simultaneously, typical
   methods of achieving forward secrecy, such as Diffie-Hellman key
   exchange and forward-secure public-key encryption, have not been widely
   approved and adopted. In this article, to capture forward secrecy of
   encrypted cloud email systems without sacrificing the practicability, we
   introduce a new cryptographic primitive named forward-secure puncturable
   identity-based encryption (fs-PIBE), which enables an email user to
   perform fine-grained revocation of decryption capacity. In more detail,
   the user is allowed to preserve the decryption capacity of unreceived
   encrypted emails, while abolishing that of those received ones. Thus, it
   provides more practical forward secrecy than typical manners, in which
   the decryption capacity of received and unreceived encrypted emails is
   revoked simultaneously. Based on such a primitive, we build a framework
   of encrypted cloud email systems, and instantiate it with a concrete
   fs-PIBE construction that has constant size of ciphertext and provable
   security in the standard model. Furthermore, to improve the security and
   efficiency of the presented framework, we extend the proposed fs-PIBE
   scheme to support end-to-end encryption and outsourced decryption,
   respectively. In addition, as a proof-of-concept of the proposed fs-PIBE
   scheme, we implement it and produce various experiments to demonstrate
   its practicability and correctness.},

Abstract = {The rapid development of digital technology has led to specific
   problems, especially in the information security area. Social
   engineering, which involves manipulating people to disclose confidential
   information, attacks computer system users as the weakest security link.
   The user contributes greatly to this phenomenon through his reckless and
   conscienceless behaviour. Raising users' awareness of social engineers'
   potential tricks against them has proven to be one of the most effective
   security measures. In order to be able to oppose social engineering at
   all, it is necessary to have a valid and reliable method of assessing
   the risky behaviour and level of information security awareness of the
   typical user. The research aimed to develop and validate a new Croatian
   version of a measurement instrument for social engineering research: the
   Behavioural-Cognitive Internet Security Questionnaire (BCISQ). Students
   of the J. J. Strossmayer University in Osijek (N=287) participated in
   this study. They have completed the BCISQ online through specially
   designed software. The BCISQ consists of 4 subscales, the first two
   examining the behavioural component (self-assessment and simulation of
   risky online behaviour) and the other two measuring the cognitive
   component of cybersecurity (awareness of online risks and the importance
   of safe computer systems use). The results showed that real (simulated)
   risky online behaviour of users is not related to their own assessments;
   that is, their self-assessments differ from their actual behaviour in
   the virtual world. Moreover, although most users have a quite high level
   of awareness of the potential online risks, a large number of them have
   entered their email address (20.9 \%), and an even greater number have
   left their password to access the same (61.7 \%). The BCISQ has proven
   to be a reliable and valid measurement instrument with good psychometric
   characteristics. It can be used for reliable assessment of the online
   behaviour and the security awareness level of information-communication
   system's users.},

Abstract = {Conventional brute-force attacks can now be detected and identified
   based on statistical analysis of logs and traffic data. However, they
   fail to detect low-frequency and distributed brute-force attack
   behaviors. To address different attack methods, new detection techniques
   have emerged. This study compares various machine learning algorithms
   and selects two methods, namely the clustering algorithm k-means and
   bdscan, as well as the decision tree algorithm for data learning. In one
   approach, normal user login data is integrated with enterprise email log
   data. The data is first statistically analyzed and filtered, followed by
   quantifying data characteristics using information entropy.
   Subsequently, machine learning algorithms are employed for
   classification, and the results are visualized for display. In another
   approach, labeled raw data is used to train a model using the decision
   tree algorithm. By comparing the two analysis results, a more accurate
   model can be obtained. These analytical methods can help enterprises
   strengthen email security and defend against low-frequency and
   distributed brute-force attacks.},

Title = {Automated User Authentication in Wireless Public Key Infrastructure for
   Mobile Devices Using Aadhar Card},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {17981-18007},
Abstract = {Identification and authentication play a significant role in security
   controls. The manual process of user identification and authentication
   is time-consuming and tedious. The proposed research work aims to
   overcome this drawback and achieve user identification and
   authentication through an automated method using the Aadhar card. Aadhar
   project is developed by the Unique Identification Authority of India by
   merging biometrics and digitization. The details are stored in the form
   of a quick response code along with a 12-digit Aadhar card number. A
   model is built to capture the information from the Aadhar card. The
   mobile phones are used to obtain the data from the Aadhar card. The user
   validation is through two-step process using One Time Password and email
   address. The wireless public key infrastructure issues a digital
   certificate to the valid user. The proposed authentication and symmetric
   key exchange algorithm are formally verified and analyzed using
   automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications.
   The result of simulation proves that the proposed scheme is secure and
   safe. The experimental results show that time consumption for user
   authentication is acceptable. The acceptance of the proposed automated
   user identification and authentication model is authorized using a
   modified technology acceptance model. The result proves that there
   exists a strong relationship between the perceived usefulness of items
   and the Attribute Of Use (AOU). It also exhibits that the association
   between the AOU and user satisfaction is influential. The model
   demonstrates that the association between the Perceived Ease Of Use and
   attribute towards use is weak. The influence of exogenous variables over
   endogenous variables exhibits that the proposed model outperforms the
   traditional manual system and the target users are inclined towards it.
   The proposed model also finds its application in services which requires
   user authentication.},

Abstract = {The current email infrastructure is burdened by multiple resource
   constraints and a plethora of security issues. Apart from the fact that
   email users are spending more time and effort sifting through
   unsolicited emails, more serious problems such as Phishing are on the
   rise. This can be attributed to a fundamental shortcoming in the current
   email infrastructure: a lack of an authorization framework. This allows
   any user to create content in anyone's mailbox. In this paper, we
   revisit the fundamental problem of non-existent authorization and
   discuss the design of an effective authorization service overlaying the
   existing email infrastructure. We propose Privilege Messaging
   (P-Messaging), a fine-granular authorization framework that operates on
   the principle that a sender requires a set of privileges in order to
   send messages, simultaneously enables the receiver's infrastructure
   server to verify the messages before accepting it. We present a
   prototype implementation and discuss its benefits. An automatic
   classification of email can be effectively performed based on the
   privilege-tag. Privilege-tag can provide flexible and fine-granular
   reputation management than current domain-based solutions. The use of
   privilege-tag as entry ID in a white-list can be more manageable than
   the use of individual email address. Finally, the privilege-tag can be
   used as an email header, retaining the benefits of currently deployed
   MTA architecture, namely reliability and flexibility.},

Abstract = {With the popularity of today's usability-oriented designs, dubbed Zero
   Configuration or ZeroConf, unclear are the security implications of
   these automatic service discovery, ``plug-and-play{''} techniques. In
   this paper, we report the first systematic study on this issue, focusing
   on the security features of the systems related to Apple, the major
   proponent of ZeroConf techniques. Our research brings to light a
   disturbing lack of security consideration in these systems' designs:
   major ZeroConf frameworks on the Apple platforms, including the Core
   Bluetooth Framework, Multipeer Connectivity and Bonjour, are mostly
   unprotected and popular apps and system services, such as Tencent QQ,
   Apple Handoff, printer discovery and AirDrop, turn out to be completely
   vulnerable to an impersonation or Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, even
   though attempts have been made to protect them against such threats. The
   consequences are serious, allowing a malicious device to steal the
   user's SMS messages, email notifications, documents to be printed out or
   transferred to another device. Most importantly, our study highlights
   the fundamental security challenges underlying ZeroConf techniques: in
   the absence of any pre-configured secret across different devices,
   authentication has to rely on Apple-issued public-key certificate, which
   however cannot be properly verified due to the difficulty in finding a
   unique, nonsensitive and widely known identity of a human user to bind
   her to her certificate. To address this issue, we developed a suite of
   new techniques, including a conflict detection approach and a biometric
   technique that enables the user to speak out her certificate through 6
   distinct, rare but pronounceable words to let those who know her voice
   verify her certificate. We performed a security analysis on the new
   protection and evaluated its usability and effectiveness using two user
   studies involving 60 participants. Our research shows that the new
   protection fits well with the existing ZeroConf systems such as AirDrop.
   It is well received by users and also providing effective defense even
   against recently proposed speech synthesis attacks.},

   Moreover, commonly applied approaches against this class of propagating

   understanding of email worms, and explore their effect on the flow-level
   characteristics of Domain Name System (DNS) query streams that user
   machines generate. We propose a novel method, which uses time series
   analysis and unsupervised learning, to detect email worms as they appear
   on local name servers. To evaluate our detection method, we have
   constructed a DNS query dataset that consists of 71 email worms. We
   demonstrate that our method is very effective.},

Abstract = {Traditionally, operating systems have enforced MAC and in,formation flow
   policies with minimal dependence on application programs. However there
   are many cases where systems depend on user-level programs to enforce
   information flows. Previous approaches to handling this problem, such as
   privilege-separation of application components or assuming trust in
   application information flow enforcement, are prone to error and
   cumbersome to manage. On the other hand, recent advances in the area of
   security-typed languages have enabled the development of realistic
   applications with formally and automatically verified information flow
   controls. In this paper, we examine what it takes to integrate
   information flow enforcement of applications written in a security-typed
   extension of Java (called Jif) with SELinux. To this end, we have
   extended the Jif infrastructure to support interaction with SELinux
   security contexts, and we describe the SELinux policy and system calls
   which are necessary for a successful integration. We have also
   identified the need for further services, such as a means of formally
   verifying compliance between information flow policies. We have
   demonstrated the utility, flexibility and security of our approach by
   constructing a prototype multi-level secure email client.},

Abstract = {Secure email systems that use end-to-end encryption are the best method
   we have for ensuring user privacy and security in email communication.
   However, the adoption of secure email remains low, with previous studies
   suggesting mainly that secure email is too complex or inconvenient to
   use. However, the perspectives of those who have, in fact, chosen to use
   an encrypted email system are largely overlooked. To understand these
   perspectives, we conducted a semi-structured interview study that aims
   to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mindsets underlying
   adoption and use of secure email services. Our participants come from a
   variety of countries and vary in the amount of time they have been using
   secure email, how often they use it, and whether they use it as their
   primary account. Our results uncover that a defining reason for adopting
   a secure email system is to avoid surveillance from big tech companies.
   However, regardless of the complexity and accuracy of a person's mental
   model, our participants rarely send and receive encrypted emails, thus
   not making full use of the privacy they could obtain. These findings
   indicate that secure email systems could potentially find greater
   adoption by appealing to their privacy advantages, but privacy gains
   will be limited until a critical mass are able to join these systems and
   easily send encrypted emails to each other.},

Abstract = {In this modern world, safety and security is becoming a very complex
   issue, especially in case of vehicles which are parking in common places
   had become a very big complex issue. But this project deals with the
   design and implementation of an additional advanced car security system
   for car, which is achieved by using an embedded system integrated with a
   spy camera inside the car and fed with the input of the sensors to it
   and which are connected to all doors of the cars. If the car door is
   unlawfully opened or the car is snooped by a thief, then the spy camera
   will tilt to that side immediately and captures the culprits face and
   that footage will be saved in database and it will be sent a mail to
   users email id, so finally the user can complain to police with the
   evidence of that footage. By this system we will be able to know the
   culprit who tries to steal our car and further data is being uploaded to
   cloud for further development where if a particular area is having this
   type complaints more then by using this system we can finally reduce the
   crime level.},

Abstract = {Email is one of the main communication tools and has seen significant
   adoption in the past decades. However, emails are sent in plain text by
   default and allow attackers easy access. Users can protect their emails
   by end-to-end encrypting them using tools such as S/MIME or PGP.
   Although PGP had already been introduced in 1991, it is a commonly held
   belief that email encryption is a niche tool that has not seen
   widespread adoption to date. Previous user studies identified ample
   usability issues with email encryption such as key management and user
   interface challenges, which likely contribute to the limited success of
   email encryption.
   However, so far ground truth based on longitudinal field data is missing
   in the literature. Towards filling this gap, we measure the use of email
   encryption based on 27 years of data for 37,089 users at a large
   university. While attending to ethical and data privacy concerns, we
   were able to analyze the use of S/MIME and PGP in 81,612,595 emails.
   We found that only 5.46\% of all users ever used S/MIME or PGP. This led
   to 0.06\% encrypted and 2.8\% signed emails. Users were more likely to
   use S/MIME than PGP by a factor of six. We saw that using multiple email
   clients had a negative impact on signing as well as encrypting emails
   and that only 3.36\% of all emails between S/MIME users who had
   previously exchanged certificates were encrypted on average.
   Our results imply that the adoption of email encryption is indeed very
   low and that key management challenges negatively impact even users who
   have set up S/MIME or PGP previously.},

Abstract = {End users are prone to insecure cyber behavior that may lead them to
   compromise the integrity, availability or confidentiality of their
   computer systems. For instance, replying to a phishing email may
   compromise an end user's login credentials. Identifying tendency toward
   insecure cyber behavior is critically important to improve cyber
   security posture and thesis of this paper is that the susceptibility of
   end-users to be a victim of a cyber-attack may be predicted using
   personality traits such as trait anxiety and callousness.
   This paper presents an easily configurable, script-based software tool
   to explore the relationships between the personality traits and insecure
   cyber behaviors of end users. The software utilizes well-established
   cognitive methods (such as dot probe) to identify a number of
   personality traits for a user and further allows researchers to design
   and conduct experiments through customizable scripting to study the end
   users' insecure cyber behaviors. The software also collects fine-grained
   data on users for analysis.},

Abstract = {Web users enter their email addresses into online forms for a variety of
   reasons, including signing in or signing up for a service or subscribing
   to a newsletter. While enabling such functionality, email addresses
   typed into forms can also be collected by third-party scripts even when
   users change their minds and leave the site without submitting the form.
   Email addresses-or identifiers derived from them-are known to be used by
   data brokers and advertisers for cross-site, cross-platform, and
   persistent identification of potentially unsuspecting individuals. In
   order to find out whether access to online forms is misused by online
   trackers, we present a measurement of email and password collection that
   occurs before the form submission on the top 100, 000 websites. We
   evaluate the effect of user location, browser configuration, and
   interaction with consent dialogs by comparing results across two vantage
   points (EU/US), two browser configurations (desktop/mobile), and three
   consent modes. Our crawler finds and fills email and password fields,
   monitors the network traffic for leaks, and intercepts script access to
   filled input fields. Our analyses show that users' email addresses are
   exfiltrated to tracking, marketing and analytics domains before form
   submission and without giving consent on 1, 844 websites in the EU crawl
   and 2, 950 websites in the US crawl. While the majority of email
   addresses are sent to known tracking domains, we further identify 41
   tracker domains that are not listed by any of the popular blocklists.
   Furthermore, we find incidental password collection on 52 websites by
   third-party session replay scripts.},

Abstract = {A large number of certified mail systems have been put into operation on
   the market over the last years. In contrast to standard mailing systems
   like e-Mail, certified mail systems provide the secure, reliable and
   evidential exchange of messages with the quality of traditional postal
   registered or certified mail. Most of these systems are tailored to
   national laws, policies, needs and technical requirements and are thus
   closed and only accessible by certain user groups. However, the ongoing
   globalization and opening of the markets, especially in the European
   Union, ask for global certified mailing as already known from e-Mail.
   Interoperability of certified mail systems is a new and challenging
   research field. This article presents a framework and standard to make
   arbitrary certified mail systems interoperable. The presented approach
   uses a federated trust network of so-called electronic delivery gateways
   for seamless certified mailing across systems. This is achieved by
   converting protocols and system specifics on different layers using a
   harmonized interoperability protocol. The presented framework has been
   standardized by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute
   (ETSI) as Registered Electronic Mail specification for interoperable
   certified mail systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Recent web-based applications offer users free service in exchange for
   access to personal communication, such as on-line email services and
   instant messaging. The inspection and retention of user communication is
   generally intended to enable targeted marketing. However,. unless
   specifically stated otherwise by the collecting service's privacy
   policy, such records have an indefinite lifetime and may be later used
   or sold without restriction. In this paper, we show that it is possible
   to protect a user's privacy from these risks by exploiting mutually
   oblivious, competing communication channels. We create virtual channels
   over online services (e.g.,. Google's Gmail, Microsoft's Hotmail)
   through which messages and cryptographic keys are delivered. The message
   recipient uses a shared secret to identify the shares and ultimately
   recover the original plaintext. In so doing, we create a wired
   ``spread-spectrum{''} mechanism for protecting the privacy of web-based
   communication. We discuss the design and implementation of our
   open-source Java applet, Aquinas, and consider ways that the myriad of
   communication channels present on the Internet can be exploited to
   preserve privacy.},

Pages = {939-946},
Abstract = {Difficult participant recruitment is a consistent barrier to successful
   medical research. Potential participant registries represent an
   increasingly common intervention to overcome this barrier. A variety of
   models for registries exist, but few data are available to instruct
   their design and implementation. To provide such data, we surveyed 110
   cognitively normal research participants enrolled in a longitudinal
   study of aging and dementia. Seventy-four (67\%) individuals
   participated in the study. Most (78\%, CI: 0.67, 0.87) participants were
   likely to enroll in a registry. Willingness to participate was reduced
   for registries that required enrollment through the Internet using a
   password (26\%, CI: 0.16, 0.36) or through email (38\%, CI: 0.27, 0.49).
   Respondents acknowledged their expectations that researchers share
   information about their health and risk for disease and their concerns
   that their data could be shared with for-profit companies. We found no
   difference in respondent preferences for registries that shared contact
   information with researchers, compared to honest broker models that take
   extra precautions to protect registrant confidentiality (28\% versus
   30\%; p = 0.46). Compared to those preferring a shared information
   model, respondents who preferred the honest broker model or who lacked
   model preference voiced increased concerns about sharing registrant
   data, especially with for-profit organizations. These results suggest
   that the design of potential participant registries may impact the
   population enrolled, and hence the population that will eventually be
   enrolled in clinical studies. Investigators operating registries may
   need to offer particular assurances about data security to maximize
   registry enrollment but also must carefully manage participant
   expectations.},

Abstract = {In the last decades, research has shown that both technical solutions
   and user perceptions are important to improve security and privacy in
   the digital realm. The field of `usable security' already started to
   emerge in the mid-90s, primarily focussed on password and email
   security. Later on, the research field of ``usable security and
   privacy{''} evolved and broadened the aim to design concepts and tools
   to assist users in enhancing their behaviour with regard to both privacy
   and security. Nevertheless, many user interventions are not as effective
   as desired. Because of highly diverse usage contexts, leading to
   different privacy and security requirements and not always to
   one-size-fits-all approaches, tailorability is necessary to address this
   issue. Furthermore, transparency is a crucial requirement, as providing
   comprehensible information may counter reactance towards security
   interventions. This article first provides a brief history of the
   research field in its first quarter-century and then highlights research
   on the transparency and tailorability of user interventions. Based on
   this, this article then presents six contributions with regard to (1)
   privacy concerns in times of COVID-19, (2) authentication on mobile
   devices, (3) GDPR-compliant data management, (4) privacy notices on
   websites, (5) data disclosure scenarios in agriculture, as well as (6)
   rights under data protection law and the concrete process should data
   subjects want to claim those rights. This article concludes with several
   research directions on user-centred transparency and tailorability.},

Abstract = {OpenPGP and S/MIME are two major standards for securing email
   communication introduced in the early 1990s. Three recent classes of
   attacks exploit weak cipher modes (EFAIL Malleability Gadgets, or
   EFAIL-MG), the flexibility of the MIME email structure (EFAIL Direct
   Exfiltration, or EFAIL-DE), and the Reply action of the email client
   (REPLY attacks). Although all three break message confidentiality by
   using standardized email features, only EFAIL-MG has been mitigated in
   IETF standards with the introduction of Authenticated Encryption with
   Associated Data (AEAD) algorithms. So far, no uniform and reliable
   countermeasures have been adopted by email clients to prevent EFAIL-DE
   and REPLY attacks. Instead, email clients implement a variety of
   different ad-hoc countermeasures which are only partially effective,
   cause interoperability problems, and fragment the secure email
   ecosystem.
   We present the first generic countermeasure against both REPLY and
   EFAIL-DE attacks by checking the decryption context including SMTP
   headers and MIME structure during decryption. The decryption context is
   encoded into a string DC and used as Associated Data (AD) in the AEAD
   encryption. Thus the proposed solution seamlessly extends the EFAIL-MG
   countermeasures. The decryption context changes whenever an attacker
   alters the email source code in a critical way, for example, if the
   attacker changes the MIME structure or adds a new Reply-To header. The
   proposed solution does not cause any interoperability problems and
   legacy emails can still be decrypted. We evaluate our approach by
   implementing the decryption contexts in Thunderbird/Enigmail and by
   verifying their correct functionality after the email has been
   transported over all major email providers, including Gmail and iCloud
   Mail.},

Title = {Privacy Enhancing Keyboard: Design, Implementation, and Usability
   Testing},
Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2017},
Abstract = {To protect users from numerous password inference attacks, we invent a
   novel context aware privacy enhancing keyboard (PEK) for Android
   touch-based devices. Usually PEK would show a QWERTY keyboard when users
   input text like an email or amessage. Nevertheless, whenever users enter
   a password in the input box on his or her touch-enabled device, a
   keyboard will be shown to them with the positions of the characters
   shuffled at random. PEK has been released on the Google Play since 2014.
   However, the number of installations has not lived up to our
   expectation. For the purpose of usable security and privacy, we designed
   a two-stage usability test and performed two rounds of iterative
   usability testing in 2016 and 2017 summer with continuous improvements
   of PEK. The observations from the usability testing are educational: (1)
   convenience plays a critical role when users select an input method; (2)
   people think those attacks that PEK prevents are remote from them.},

Abstract = {As technologies to defend against phishing and malware often impose an
   additional financial and usability cost on users (such as security
   keys), a question remains as to who should adopt these heightened
   protections. We measure over 1.2 billion email-based phishing and
   malware attacks against Gmail users to understand what factors place a
   person at heightened risk of attack. We find that attack campaigns are
   typically short-lived and at first glance indiscriminately target users
   on a global scale. However, by modeling the distribution of targeted
   users, we find that a person's demographics, location, email usage
   patterns, and security posture all significantly influence the
   likelihood of attack. Our findings represent a first step towards
   empirically identifying the most at-risk users.},

Abstract = {While website domain typosquatting is highly annoying for legitimate
   domain operators, research has found that it relatively rarely presents
   a great risk to individual users. However, any application (e.g., email,
   ftp, ...) relying on the domain name system for name resolution is
   equally vulnerable to domain typosquatting, and consequences may be more
   dire than with website typosquatting.
   This paper presents the first in-depth measurement study of email
   typosquatting. Working in concert with our IRB, we registered 76
   typosquatting domain names to study a wide variety of user mistakes,
   while minimizing the amount of personal information exposed to us. In
   the span of over seven months, we received millions of emails at our
   registered domains. While most of these emails are spam, we infer, from
   our measurements, that every year, three of our domains should receive
   approximately 3,585 ``legitimate{''} emails meant for somebody else.
   Worse, we find, by examining a small sample of all emails, that these
   emails may contain sensitive information (e.g., visa documents or
   medical records).
   We then project from our measurements that 1,211 typosquatting domains
   registered by unknown entities receive in the vicinity of 800,000 emails
   a year. Furthermore, we find that millions of registered typosquatting
   domains have MX records pointing to only a handful of mail servers.
   However, a second experiment in which we send ``honey emails{''} to
   typosquatting domains only shows very limited evidence of attempts at
   credential theft (despite some emails being read), meaning that the
   threat, for now, appears to remain theoretical.},

Abstract = {Several sensitive operations, such as financial transactions, email
   construction, configurations of safety-critical devices (e.g., medical
   devices or smart home systems), are often performed via web interfaces
   from a host machine, usually a desktop or laptop PC. It is typically
   easy to secure the communication link between the local host machine and
   the remote server, for example, via a standard cryptographic protocol
   (e.g., TLS). However, if the host machine itself is compromised with a
   trojan or malware, the malicious adversary can manipulate the
   user-provided input (e.g., money transfer information, email content and
   configuration data) that can lead to severe consequences, including
   financial loss, damage of reputation, security breach, and even put
   human lives in danger.
   In this paper, we introduce the notion of integrity verification for the
   user-provided input leveraging a wrist-worn wearable device (e.g., a
   watch or a bracelet). Specifically, we propose IvoriWatch(1), a
   transparent and secure integrity verification mechanism, that inspects
   the user-provided input from a compromised host machine to a remote
   server for its integrity before acting upon the input. IvoriWatch
   requires the user to wear a wrist-wearable (either on one hand or both
   hands for better security). It verifies the validity of the
   payload/input received at the remote server by comparing it (i.e., the
   corresponding sequence of keyboard regions - left or right) with the
   predicted ones based on the wrist motions captured by the
   wrist-wearable. Only when the user input sufficiently correlates with
   the wrist motion data, the input is considered legitimate. We build a
   prototype implementation of IvoriWatch on an Android smartwatch as the
   wrist-wearable and a desktop PC terminal as a host machine, and evaluate
   it under benign and adversarial settings. Our results suggest that
   IvoriWatch can correctly detect the legitimacy of the input in the
   benign setting, and the manipulated as well as unintended input from a
   malicious program in the adversarial settings with minimal errors.
   Although IvoriWatch uses wrist movements for integrity verification, it
   is not a biometric scheme.},

Abstract = {Fallback authentication, the process of re-establishing access to an
   account when the primary authenticator is unavailable, holds critical
   signifcance. Approaches range from secondary channels like email and SMS
   to personal knowledge questions (PKQs) and social authentication. A key
   diference to primary authentication is that the duration between
   enrollment and authentication can be much longer, typically months or
   years. However, few systems have been studied over extended timeframes,
   making it difcult to know how well these systems truly help users
   recover their accounts. We also lack meaningful comparisons of schemes
   as most prior work examined two mechanisms at most. We report the
   results of a long-term user study of the usability of fallback
   authentication over 18 months to provide a fair comparison of the four
   most commonly used fallback authentication methods. We show that users
   prefer email and SMS-based methods, while mechanisms based on PKQs and
   trustees lag regarding successful resets and convenience.},

Abstract = {Online meetings through various Unified Communication (UC) platforms are
   a common theme in the daily lives of many people. While the security
   features of many UC platforms have been improved over time, e.g.,
   through the addition of end-to-end encryption, the invitation process is
   commonly still based on calendar invites sent by email. These email
   invitations form a security and privacy weakness for unified
   communication systems. To mitigate this weakness, we present in this
   paper the novel Secure and Privacy-Preserving Invitation (SEPPI)
   architecture. Based on FIDO2 authentication, SEPPI provides
   confidentiality and integrity for meeting invites and pseudonymity and
   unlinkability for meeting participants. We analyze the security of SEPPI
   and conduct a large-scale systematic user evaluation of a SEPPI
   prototype. Our findings suggest that SEPPI achieves increased privacy
   and security at an acceptable convenience cost.},

Abstract = {Security is a growing concern in modern computer networks. Despite the
   implementation of significant security measures, a network can still be
   exposed to attackers by the actions of its users. Both attackers and
   penetration testers use social engineering tactics to exploit the
   mistakes made by users. For example, a user being tricked into clicking
   on a malicious link in a phishing email. Network security administrators
   seek ways to prevent intrusion into the network initiated by users
   performing such risky actions, and use methodologies to detect and
   respond safely when those actions occur. If we were able to simulate
   these user actions in a controlled network, it would help prepare
   networks to be sufficiently hardened to prevent exposure. The goal of
   this paper is to seek out different ways users create vulnerabilities,
   and use that information to determine the feasibility of replicating
   them in a network as semi-autonomous agents for evaluating security. We
   seek to determine existing research on network breaches caused by
   unwitting-users, the common and current exploits attackers use to trick
   users, and the mitigations that can prevent intrusion into the network.},

Abstract = {Emails have improved our workplace efficiency and communication.
   However, they are often processed unencrypted by mail servers, leaving
   them open to data breaches on a single service provider. Public-key
   based solutions for end-to-end secured email, such as Pretty Good
   Privacy (PGP) and Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME),
   are available but are not widely adopted due to usability obstacles and
   also hinder processing of encrypted emails.
   We propose PrivMail, a novel approach to secure emails using secret
   sharing methods. Our framework utilizes Secure Multi-Party Computation
   techniques to relay emails through multiple service providers, thereby
   preventing any of them from accessing the content in plaintext.
   Additionally, PrivMail supports private server-side email processing
   similar to IMAP SEARCH, and eliminates the need for cryptographic
   certificates, resulting in better usability than public-key based
   solutions. An important aspect of our framework is its capability to
   enable third-party searches on user emails while maintaining the privacy
   of both the email and the query used to conduct the search.
   To evaluate our solution, we benchmarked transfer and search operations
   using the Enron Email Dataset and demonstrate that PrivMail is an
   effective solution for enhancing email security.},

Abstract = {Many websites include buttons or links that are labeled with the text
   ``Email this Story to a Friend!{''} or similar. These tools allow users
   to conveniently share news stories and information about products and
   services of interest to friends, family and colleagues via email.
   Information sharing on the Web is a phenomenon that has attracted the
   attention of Internet marketers who are interested in extending and
   fine-tuning their Web-based advertising campaigns. Although many
   commercial websites include sharing tools, their characteristics have
   not yet been systematically examined.
   This paper reports on an exploratory study of the design and functional
   features of sharing tools on a sample of 11 American newspaper websites.
   The sharing toot were examined to gather data about their appearance,
   location, and features provided to both senders and recipients of
   generated email messages. Additionally, sample news stories were
   ``shared{''} with one of the authors using each of the sharing tools,
   and data about the appearance and content of these messages were
   collected. The major findings of the study suggest that on the sampled
   websites: (1) there is lack of standardization in the visual design and
   placement of the sharing tools, (2) insufficient information is provided
   to the user about how to use the tool, (3) written details about the
   security of users' and senders' privacy are absent or incomplete, and
   (4) many tools lack the ability to be user-customized, and are not
   convenient to use. A discussion of the implications of the findings is
   provided, and recommendations are suggested for improving sharing tool
   usability. Web-marketers, Web-developers and Web-users interested in a
   systematic overview of website sharing tools are the intended audience
   of this paper.},

Abstract = {Recent web-based applications offer users free service in exchange for
   access to personal communication, such as on-line email services and
   instant messaging. The inspection and retention of user communication is
   generally intended to enable targeted marketing. However, unless
   specifically stated otherwise by the collecting service's privacy
   policy, such records have an indefinite lifetime and may be later used
   or sold without restriction. In this paper, we show that it is possible
   to protect a user's privacy from these risks by exploiting mutually
   oblivious, competing communication channels. We create virtual channels
   over online services (e.g., Google's Gmail, Microsoft's Hotmail) through
   which messages and cryptographic keys are delivered. The message
   recipient uses a shared secret to identify the shares and ultimately
   recover the original plaintext. In so doing, we create a wired
   ``spread-spectrum{''} mechanism for protecting the privacy of web-based
   communication. We discuss the design and implementation of our
   open-source Java applet, Aquinas, and consider ways that the myriad of
   communication channels present on the Internet can be exploited to
   preserve privacy.},

Abstract = {Blockchain has gained traction for its decentralized nature, transaction
   security, transparency, and immutability. However, integrating external
   information requires using oracle services, which introduce complexities
   and vulnerabilities that can compromise the reliability and integrity of
   blockchain-based applications. This paper addresses the challenge of
   oracle decentralization using our MetaMail system as an example.
   MetaMail enables user authentication and transaction confirmation in
   Ethereum via email (using OAuth 2.0 protocol). Initially relying on a
   centralized oracle, the MetaMail system faced vulnerabilities with the
   oracle as a single point of failure. The proposed Decentralized Oracle
   Network (DON) enhances user authentication, validation reliability,
   security, and trustworthiness, effectively mitigating risks connected to
   centralized oracles. We discuss the DON's architecture and security
   considerations. The comparative analysis highlights the advantages of a
   decentralized approach and emphasizes the potential of DON's for user

Title = {Mobile cloud security: An adversary model for lightweight browser
   security},
Journal = {COMPUTER STANDARDS \& INTERFACES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {49},
Pages = {71-78},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Lightweight browsers on mobile devices are increasingly been used to
   access cloud services and upload / view data stored on the cloud, due to
   their faster resource loading capabilities. These browsers use client
   side efficiency measures such as larger cache storage and fewer plugins.
   However, the impact on data security of such measures is an understudied
   area. In this paper, we propose an adversary model to examine the
   security of lightweight browsers. Using the adversary model, we reveal
   previously unpublished vulnerabilities in four popular light browsers,
   namely: UC Browser, Dolphin, CM Browser, and Samsung Stock Browser,
   which allows an attacker to obtain unauthorized access to the user's
   private data. The latter include browser history, email content, and
   bank account details. For example, we also demonstrate that it is
   possible to replace the images of the cache in one of the browsers,
   which can be used to facilitate phishing and other fraudulent
   activities. By identifying the design flaw in these browsers (i.e.
   improper file storage), we hope that future browser designers can avoid
   similar errors. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {One of the latest computer-related problems to arise is phishing, which
   is the criminally fraudulent process in which e-mails lure unsuspecting
   victims into giving up user names, passwords, Social Security numbers,
   and account information after linking to counterfeit bank, credit card,
   and e-commerce Web sites. Phishers are mainly targeting the customers of
   banks and online payment services. It is so pervasive that even
   corporate and government sites are actively informing the users on this
   issue. This paper presents a solution, which aims to protect users
   against email phishing attacks. Main key words which are used are a user
   ID and password, and the other is an authenticating question. An e-mail
   that a bank sends to user contains some image and preselected question
   which the phisher couldn't have, that the user chose when setting up the
   account. This proves to the user that the e-mail came from the bank or
   business, not a phisher, and that it is safe to use the provided link.
   The user is asked to provide his ID and the bank checks if the ID is
   valid or not. If the ID is valid, the user is asked to load the image
   which has been mailed and answer his preselected question along with a
   request for their logon password. After receiving the correct password,
   user is allowed to access the Web site.},

Title = {SMFA: Strengthening Multi-Factor Authentication With Steganography for
   Enhanced Security},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {43593-43606},
Abstract = {Traditional password-based authentication mechanisms exhibit significant
   security vulnerabilities, prompting the adoption of Multi-Factor
   Authentication (MFA) to enhance user verification. However, current MFA
   methods, such as OffPAD, One-Time Password Tokens (OTT), and
   smartcard-based systems, remain vulnerable to attacks like
   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM), session hijacking, replay, phishing, and
   denial of service (DoS). Additionally, the conventional single-server
   authentication approach is inefficient and inadequate for modern
   security needs. This study introduces Secure Multi-Factor Authentication
   (SMFA), a novel framework designed to address these challenges by
   leveraging steganography for secure credential transmission, reducing
   susceptibility to MITM and session hijacking attacks. SMFA also
   incorporates an additional Universal Serial Bus (USB) device as a
   supplementary authentication factor and employs a multi-server
   architecture to overcome the limitations of single-server models. A
   comprehensive analysis comparing SMFA to existing MFA protocols reveals
   its superior ability to counter MITM, replay, DoS, user impersonation,
   and password-guessing attacks. The results demonstrate that SMFA offers
   a robust and effective solution, addressing the weaknesses of both
   traditional password-based systems and current MFA methods.},

Abstract = {Many web services have a subsystem for allowing users to register,
   authenticate, reset their password, and change personal details. It is
   important that such subsystems cannot be abused by attackers to gain
   access to the accounts of other users. We study a system which was
   initially prone to such attacks. Specific attacks are demonstrated and
   the system is then modified to prevent such attacks in future. The
   design achieved in this way is then analysed to show that it can't be
   broken in future unless users allow their email to he intercepted. This
   is achieved by formulating the requirement as a statement of the user's
   expectations of the system and then analysing the source code of the
   system to prove that it meets these requirements. The process of attack,
   correction, and formulation of security rules, and proof that rules
   hold, is proposed as a methodical security design philosophy.},

Abstract = {Several email virus models have been proposed in previous papers.
   Usually, users in these models are homogeneous and symmetric which fail
   to model the real situation accurately. In this paper, a novel model
   with local group is presented. In real email system, users will usually
   group their contacts into various kinds of groups. Moreover, users have
   different levels of security awareness according to different closeness
   with certain group. To model the condition, we propose the propagation
   model with local group. In our model, a user is modeled as an autonomy
   agent who is able to deal with email and group its ego network. Based on
   the local group algorithm, open probability is carefully defined
   overcoming the disadvantage of homogeneous model. Applying our model on
   benchmark networks, we use the space-time diagrams for a small network
   and curve graph for real email network to verify our model. Simulations
   indicate that users will not be infected until his close friend group
   mostly being infected, showing that the group provides buffer for virus
   spreading. On the other hand, in accordance with the local group action
   in reality, the propagation is largely deferred compared with the
   homogeneous model.},

Title = {Categorizing human phishing difficulty: a Phish Scale},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CYBERSECURITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 14},
Abstract = {As organizations continue to invest in phishing awareness training
   programs, many chief information security officers (CISOs) are concerned
   when their training exercise click rates are high or variable, as they
   must justify training budgets to organization officials who question the
   efficacy of awareness training when click rates are not declining. We
   argue that click rates should be expected to vary based on the
   difficulty of the phishing email for a target audience. Past research
   has shown that when the premise of a phishing email aligns with a user's
   work context, it is much more challenging for users to detect a phish.
   Given this, we propose a Phish Scale, so CISOs and phishing training
   implementers can easily rate the difficulty of their phishing exercises
   and help explain associated click rates. We base our scale on past
   research in phishing cues and user context, and apply the scale to
   previously published and new data from enterprise-based phishing
   exercises. The Phish Scale performed well with the current phishing
   dataset, but future work is needed to validate it with a larger variety
   of phishing emails. The Phish Scale shows great promise as a tool to
   help frame data sharing on phishing exercise click rates across sectors.},

Abstract = {Due to the rapid advancement of social media, a huge amount of data is
   generated daily. Due to this great spread and expansion of the data at
   the social or professional level, the risks of securing the information
   become a challenging job. In this regard, we conducted an in-depth
   interview to gather specific information about how infected users may be
   provided with information about recovering their hacked social
   networking accounts. Further, we have introduced a complete solution to
   help social network users to improve the idea of using different
   applications from one appropriate platform. In order to build this
   secure platform for accessing the security applications such as bank
   accounts, etc., we set various security methods to access social network
   websites, such as sending an OTP to their respective mobile devices,
   email or by fingerprint. Further, we also added a camera to identify the
   wrong or fake registration process of an intruder. The camera captures
   an image of the intruder registering to a social network website using
   the legitimate user's information. In addition, the application also has
   a solution for forgetting the password or security questions that are
   sent to the user via email. Finally, the application saves the password,
   which can be recovered when the user forgets it.},

Abstract = {E-mail Security has been a growing concern over the past few years. The
   average individual, who uses e-mail, naively believes that their e-mail
   is private and secure. The electronic world is filled with snoopers who
   can access all types of data over the network. As the world goes
   digital, with more and more raw information about individuals available
   electronically, the need for security increases. Ubiquity and speed of
   email have made it increasingly effective. So providing reliance over
   this medium has become an inevitable requirement. The emails of today
   are secured by encrypting the content on an external medium and sending
   this as an attachment over the mail. The current trend increases the
   size of the mail and makes it inconvenient for the user. There are other
   systems that provide specific security and are strongly tied to the mail
   servers and browsers.},

Title = {Filtering and Detection of Real-Time Spam Mail Based on a Bayesian
   Approach in University Networks},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {With the advent of digital technologies as an integral part of today's
   everyday life, the risk of information security breaches is increasing.
   Email spam, commonly known as junk email, continues to pose a
   significant challenge in the digital realm, inundating inboxes with
   unsolicited and often irrelevant messages. This relentless influx of
   spam not only disrupts user productivity but also raises security
   concerns, as it frequently serves as a vehicle for phishing attempts,
   malware distribution, and other cyber threats. The prevalence of spam is
   fueled by its low-cost dissemination and its ability to reach a wide
   audience, exploiting vulnerabilities in email systems. This paper marks
   the inception of an in-depth investigation into the viability and
   potential implementation of a robust spam filtering and prevention
   system tailored explicitly to university networks. With the escalating
   threat of email-based hacking attacks and the incessant deluge of spam,
   the need for a comprehensive and effective defense mechanism within
   academic institutions becomes increasingly imperative. In exploring
   potential solutions, this study delves into the applicability and
   efficacy of Bayesian filters, a class of probabilistic classifiers
   renowned for their aptitude in distinguishing between legitimate emails
   and spam messages. Bayesian filters utilize statistical algorithms to
   analyze email content, learning patterns and features to accurately
   categorize incoming emails.},

Title = {Feasibility and Usability of the Job Adjustment Mobile App for Pregnant
   Women: Longitudinal Observational Study},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {7},
Abstract = {Background: Working pregnant women often need to adjust their physically
   demanding jobs for a healthy pregnancy. However, uncertainty about the
   extent of these adjustments can hinder their effectiveness. To address
   this, we developed the Job Adjustment mobile app, which allows users to
   input job and health details to generate a variety of personalized
   action plans. As this is the first version of the app, assessing its
   feasibility and usability is crucial. Objective: This study aims to
   verify the feasibility and usability of the Job Adjustment mobile app.
   Methods: A longitudinal observational study was conducted on pregnant
   Japanese women who were allowed to use the app anytime from 12 to 34
   weeks of gestation; they received reminder emails every 2 weeks
   encouraging app use. A questionnaire was administered before app use and
   at 20 and 32 weeks of gestation. Feasibility was evaluated across 4
   domains: implementation, demand, acceptability, and adverse events.
   Implementation was evaluated based on 3 parameters: dropout rate,
   initial reminder email receipt rate, and adherence rate (measured as
   pregnant women who used the app at intervals of 2.5 weeks or less).
   Demand was measured by intervals between use and intervals between
   log-in, and participants answered 15 questions to assess acceptability.
   Adverse events were assessed by analyzing the degree of anxiety related
   to work. Demographic data were analyzed to determine any statistically
   significant differences in intervals between uses. Usability was
   evaluated using the System Usability Scale. Results: The analysis
   included 66 pregnant women, and 61\% (n=40) of them were multipara. The
   dropout rate, adherence rate, and initial reminder email receipt rate
   were 18\% (13/71), 44\% (29/66), and 79\% (52/66) respectively. The
   median intervals between use and intervals between log-in were 2.94 (IQR
   2.00-5.13) weeks and 2.28 (IQR 1.81-4.00) weeks, respectively. Overall,
   60\% (35/58) to 90\% (52/58) of the participants responded positively to
   all 15 questions assessing acceptability, and no anxiety regarding work
   was recorded. The mean System Usability Scale score was 66.1 points.
   Multipara women had significantly longer Conclusions: The results
   demonstrated acceptable levels of feasibility and usability of the app.
   However, the low adherence rates, especially among multipara women,
   suggest the need for modifications to reduce the time burden of the app.
   Further research should explore more effective and acceptable intervals
   between use and timing, involving a larger sample and accounting for
   diverse characteristics of pregnant women. Trial Registration: UMIN

Abstract = {Due to the increasing number of recommendations for people to use
   Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to protect their privacy, more
   application developers are creating VPN applications and publishing them
   on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. In this `gold rush',
   applications are being developed quickly and, in turn, not being
   developed with security in mind.
   This paper investigated a selection of VPN applications available on the
   Apple App Store (for iOS devices) and tested the applications for
   security and privacy issues. This includes testing for any traffic being
   transmitted over plain HTTP, DNS leakage and transmission of personally
   identifiable information (such as phone number, International Mobile
   Equipment Identity (IMEI), email address, MAC address) and evaluating
   the security of the tunneling protocol used by the VPN.
   The testing methodology involved installing VPN applications on a test
   device, simulating network traffic for a pre-defined period of time and
   capturing the traffic. This allows for all traffic to be analysed to
   check for anything being sent without encryption. Other issues that
   often cause de-anonymization with VPN applications such as DNS leakage
   were also considered.
   The research found several common security issues with VPN applications
   tested, with a large majority of applications still using HTTP and not
   HTTPS for transmitting certain data. A large majority of the VPN
   applications failed to route additional user data (such as DNS queries)
   through the VPN tunnel. Furthermore, just fifteen of the tested
   applications were found to have correctly implemented the
   best-recommended tunneling protocol for user security.
   Outside of the regular testing criteria, other security anomalies were
   observed with specific applications, which included outdated servers
   with known vulnerabilities, applications giving themselves the ability
   to perform HTTPS interception and questionable privacy policies.
   From the documented vulnerabilities, this research proposes a set of
   recommendations for developers to consider when developing VPN
   applications.},

Abstract = {In the today's world Internet is now a basic platform for people to make
   the interactions with each other similarly for business community. The
   identity management system is the core part of this platform. The
   identity management systems keep track of user \& user access over the
   network. The main motivation of the identity management systems is to
   maintain the identities of user \& their access among the network \&
   business partners. As the user are accessing the web site on internet
   for that they have to use or provide their email address \& name as the
   input for authentication \& authorization after that they can able to
   access the system but the modern Identity management system are not
   require the user credentials again \& gain. Once the user is
   authenticated then his account is Provisioning on particular resource
   then he can easily access the system data. The identity management
   system proposed in this paper determine that who can enter your
   protected systems, at what level user can have the access to the system,
   what can they access \& it will also ensure that users access only what
   they need for their business tasks.},

Title = {Personalizing Driver Agent Using Large Language Models for Driving
   Safety and Smarter Human-Machine Interactions},
Journal = {IEEE INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS MAGAZINE},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 APR 1},
Abstract = {Driver assistance systems have been shown to reduce crashes by providing
   real-time warnings or assistance, with their effectiveness depending on
   communication with driver. Due to their unique characteristics, human
   drivers possess varying hazard perception skills and interaction
   preferences, making personalized assistance crucial to improving the
   user experience and system acceptance. However, how to leverage
   multimodal interfaces that dynamically adapt to warning contents and
   driver characteristics remains an open question. At the same time, large
   language models (LLMs) have demonstrated advanced capabilities in
   knowledge acquisition, planning, and human-machine collaboration,
   offering potential solutions for existing warning systems. Thus, we
   develop an LLM-based personalized driver agent (PDA), which provides
   personalized warnings through multimodal interactions (visual, voice,
   and tactile). The agent's architecture mimics human cognitive processes
   via four core modules: memory, perception, control, and action. Results
   from our experiments indicate that the LLM-PDA effectively customizes
   warning contents for different drivers in various situations, providing
   enhanced safety and driver support. This article pioneers the
   integration of LLMs into automotive human-vehicle interaction and offers
   novel insights into personalized human-machine interaction in
   intelligent vehicles.},

Title = {Evaluating the security of CAPTCHAs utilized on Bangladeshi websites},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {140},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {A number of attacks such as spamming, email -address harvesting,
   dictionary attacks, brute -force attacks, credential surfing attacks,
   DOS attacks and others can be executed relatively easily if the target
   system cannot differentiate between requests coming from a real human
   user and those generated artificially by bots. In order to distinguish
   between human users and bots, the Completely Automatic Public Turing
   Test (CAPTCHA) has been used for almost 20 years. Nevertheless, CAPTCHA
   can be easily broken if it lacks security features. Consequently, the
   motivation for utilizing CAPTCHA is undermined. This article proposes a
   framework that can evaluate the security aspects of text CAPTCHAs. The
   effectiveness of the framework is validated by using a generalized
   attack method consisting of pre-processing and utilizing an Optical
   Character Recognition (OCR) library such as Tesseract OCR. We have
   carried out a systematic study of existing CAPTCHAs utilized on
   Bangladeshi websites. We have studied 238 Bangladeshi websites and found
   that only 44 websites used a CAPTCHA mechanism. Then, we have assessed
   the security levels of the selected text CAPTCHAs by the proposed
   framework. As per our analysis, we have found that there are 29
   different CAPTCHA schemes being adopted on Bangladeshi websites and
   among them 23 are vulnerable to automated attacks. In order to address
   these issues, we also present a number of recommendations.},

Title = {Monitoring information security risks within health care},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {37},
Pages = {31-45},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper presents an overview of possible risks to the security of
   health care data. These risks were detected with a novel approach to
   information security. It is based on the philosophy that information
   security risk monitoring should include human and societal factors, and
   that collaboration between organisations and experts is essential to
   gain knowledge about potential risks. The methodology uses a mixed
   methods approach including a quantitative analysis of historical
   security incident data and expert elicitation through a Delphi study.
   The result is an overview of the possible socio-technical risks that a
   panel of experts expect to materialise in health care organisations in
   the near future. These risks include (amongst others): staff leaving
   data assets unattended on the premises and these assets consequently go
   missing, staff sharing passwords to access patient data and staff
   sending email containing personal patient data to the wrong addressee
   thus disclosing data to unauthorised persons. The expert panel
   recognized risks from current discussion topics such as outsourcing, but
   these risks are still considered to appear less frequently than the more
   traditional information security risks. Furthermore, the panel did not
   estimate a high frequency of occurrence of socio-technical information
   security risks caused by new technologies such as cloud computing or
   RFID. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is helpful in making people's life more
   convenient and efficient. To ensure that the nodes within IoT can
   interact securely, a certificateless signature (CLS) can be used to
   protect message authentication in the IoT. Recently, some concrete
   constructions of CLS schemes have been proposed in the literature, but
   through our analyses, we demonstrate that some existing CLS schemes
   cannot keep their claimed security because of various security flaws.
   For example, a valid signature can be forged by any Type I adversary by
   replacing the corresponding user's public key. In this article, we
   describe the security flaws that need to be addressed and introduce a
   novel CLS scheme without using bilinear mapping. The existential
   unforgeability in our proposed scheme can be proved based on the
   hardness of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem in the random
   oracle model. The comparison with existing CLS schemes shows that our
   scheme not only enjoys more security features but also is more efficient
   in computation. Moreover, we introduce an identity authentication
   protocol as the application of our proposed CLS scheme, which achieves
   mutual authentication and anonymity in communications.},

Title = {Human Communication Dynamics in Digital Footsteps: A Study of the
   Agreement between Self-Reported Ties and Email Networks},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {6},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 17},
Abstract = {Digital communication data has created opportunities to advance the
   knowledge of human dynamics in many areas, including national security,
   behavioral health, and consumerism. While digital data uniquely captures
   the totality of a person's communication, past research consistently
   shows that a subset of contacts makes up a person's ``social network{''}
   of unique resource providers. To address this gap, we analyzed the
   correspondence between self-reported social network data and email
   communication data with the objective of identifying the dynamics in
   e-communication that correlate with a person's perception of a
   significant network tie. First, we examined the predictive utility of
   three popular methods to derive social network data from email data
   based on volume and reciprocity of bilateral email exchanges. Second, we
   observed differences in the response dynamics along self-reported ties,
   allowing us to introduce and test a new method that incorporates
   time-resolved exchange data. Using a range of robustness checks for
   measurement and misreporting errors in self-report and email data, we
   find that the methods have similar predictive utility. Although
   e-communication has lowered communication costs with large numbers of
   persons, and potentially extended our number of, and reach to contacts,
   our case results suggest that underlying behavioral patterns indicative
   of friendship or professional contacts continue to operate in a
   classical fashion in email interactions.},

Abstract = {Maintaining the security of information systems and associated data
   resources is vital if an organization is to minimize losses. Access
   controls are the first line of defense in this process. The primary
   function of authentication controls is to ensure that only authorized
   users have access to information systems and electronic resources.
   Password-based systems remain the predominant means of user
   authentication despite viable authentication alternatives. Research
   suggests that password-based systems are often compromised by poor user
   security practices. This chapter presents the results of a survey of 884
   computer users that examines user practice in creating and reusing
   password keys, and reports the findings on user password composition and
   security practices for email accounts. Despite a greater awareness of
   security issues, the results show that many users still select and reuse
   weak passwords keys that are based on dictionary words and other
   meaningful information.},

Abstract = {This research creates home security service with social interaction
   based on a web-based multiple stations supervisory control framework. A
   supervisory control server kept in a company can serve numerous Arduino
   controllers to provide home security service. An Arduino controller is
   used as a thin-controller to control a home security system. Most
   control laws are computed in server-side, driving commands are
   transferred to local controllers for execution. The Arduino controller
   can sense door switch, motion detection, smoke detection, gas detection,
   CO detection, and an emergency button, and can drive door lock, two
   relays. Besides, RFID is used to help personnel in/out management and
   alert enable/disable. The controller reads inputs, uploads input/output
   data to the supervisory server, executes commands from the server, and
   drives output continuously. Once a controller is connected to the
   supervisory server, it can be monitored and controlled remotely.
   Condition control is proposed for the framework to help program control
   laws for Arduino controllers. In condition control, conditions are set.
   When some condition is met, certain actions are taken. There are three
   types of conditions; time condition, input/output condition, and
   location condition. And there are three kinds of actions; SMS
   notification, email notification, and output drive. Conditions, actions
   and their connections are set by system users in a browser with the help
   of the supervisory control information management system. The control
   laws set in the condition control are executed in server-side. User of
   the home security system can open the read/write rights of his
   input/output points to other users. With appropriate control law, a
   motion detection signal of one user can activate the alarm of another
   user. Therefore, the home security service is not just a security for
   user's home, but a security for a social group.},

Abstract = {Robotics is one of the most rapidly evolving technologies which has been
   put to good use in many diverse applications. And today, with the power
   of artificial intelligence, the ability of a robot to be aware of its
   surroundings and to think more smartly has made it eligible to perform
   even more complex tasks. Home security and surveillance is one such
   task, and deploying a robot with intelligence to monitor home safety is
   the main objective of this paper. Traditionally, stationary CCTV cameras
   are installed everywhere in the house. Installation of a lot of these
   devices is a tedious task and maintaining and monitoring each and every
   one of them is difficult. In this paper, a smart user friendly
   surveillance robot is proposed, which can overcome the drawbacks of the
   conventional method of CCTV. This obstacle avoiding robot can monitor
   the status of the entire house while the resident is away, namely
   detecting the presence of burglars and gas leakage from LPG Cylinders.
   The robot's design also includes transmission of monitored data to the
   Thing-Speak IoT Cloud Server, from which the resident receives instant
   email messages in case of presence of a burglar or excessive gas leakage
   detected by the robot. The purpose of this robot is to monitor a house,
   but it can also be used at other places like factories, offices, etc.
   Thus, this robot is user friendly and also supports real time
   monitoring, which can be made use of for surveillance tasks in general.},

Abstract = {With the advancement of technology and ICT, a radical change in life is
   reflecting all around. In this 21st century, with the gift of Internet,
   Internet of Things (IoT) has become an integral part of our everyday
   life. Today IoT not only enable sensations of life but also imparts new
   genre of innovations. It has been found that IoT plays a significant
   role in achieving security. In this proposed research using IoT for
   Smart Security Surveillance System aimed at enhancing the security of
   home with the help of IoT. The research intends to develop a smartest
   version of doorbell with more security, flexibility and connectivity. In
   this work, with the help of sensor and camera, the system detects motion
   in front of the door and capture picture which is sent to the user's
   cell phone along with the picture in the email inbox and a detection
   message. In addition a push button for the guest interaction is also
   considered. The user is able to see what is happening in front of the
   door in real time sitting on the Internet. A camera module is deployed
   to capture the picture of the visitor and stream a video on the basis of
   passive infra-red (PIR) sensor and the button. In the future, further AI
   will be added to the system for recognizing and identifying the gesture

Abstract = {In today's digital landscape, email is acknowledged as a critical
   conduit for global data exchanges. With a surge in data volume,
   malefactors exploit user identities, leading to data misuse.
   Cybercriminals employ electronic transgressions such as phishing and
   spam to orchestrate security infractions. Machine learning counters
   these breaches using myriad techniques, demonstrating significant
   efficiency in identifying phishing emails. We can divide machine
   learning into two types: supervised and unsupervised. Supervised
   learning requires pre-training the model on labelled datasets,
   amalgamating classification, and regression learning. Notably,
   supervised methodologies such as support vector machines (SVMs), naive
   Bayes, decision trees, neural networks, random forests, and deep
   learning have been exploited for spam filtering. This review delves into
   issues concerning spam filtering and email classification through
   supervised machine learning techniques, offering a comprehensive
   evaluation of strategies, methods, performance indicators, and the
   benefits and drawbacks of different research. This information allows
   researchers to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of supervised
   learning algorithms, laying the foundation for advanced email
   categorization techniques.},

Abstract = {Effective security support remains a challenge, even for mobile banking
   applications; this is leading to the loss of many customers due to
   limited protection of customer data and privacy. Cyber threats include
   everything from identity theft to malware threats and email and online
   fraud. Thus, businesses and individuals should use risk assessment
   methods and countermeasures to protect their m-banking apps. With this
   in mind, a new model using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) has
   been proposed. The model has been broken down into six main
   countermeasure categories, namely: perceived risk, perceived security,
   perceived trust, ease of use, usefulness and service quality. To test
   this model, structural equation modelling (SEM) was used. Our findings
   reveal that perceived security, perceived trust and service quality play
   key roles in improving the adoption of mobile banking apps. In addition,
   the findings indicate that perceived risk had a negative impact on both
   clients' trust and their attitudes toward the use of mobile banking
   services. The proposed model could increase the adoption of m-banking
   apps by enhancing their defenses against security risk issues. The model
   enhances the risk reduction (63.0\%), data protection (75.0\%), trust
   (32.1\%), quality of service (74.0\%), ease of use (44.0\%) and
   usefulness (45.3\%) ratios.},

Abstract = {From the inception of email in the last era until this hour, many
   stories about misleading victims in phishing emails are published.
   Phishing email has been considered to be one of the most common threats.
   Many researchers wonder why the phishing email still works. The problem
   lies in the strategies used by the attacker in the electronic trap and
   the lack of security awareness by the user at the same time. This paper
   presents stages and steps of phishing email and investigates the most
   tricking techniques used by the attacker to attract the user. The paper
   also motivates work on non-technical solutions and reviews the types of
   detection methods of phishing emails concentrating on methods related to
   message contents.},

Abstract = {World Wide statistics show the increasing number of properties such as
   cars, house, and offices, in term of production and theft attempts.
   There is a big international effort in research and industrial
   production done to develop and produce security systems, but we still in
   need for more improvement since the number of theft cases are still
   increases. The thieves become more professional and inventing powerful
   stealing techniques which require more effective security systems. This
   research project tries to solve such problem by making use of the
   advancement in mobility and electronic technologies to develop an
   effective surveillance model. The proposed model integrates both
   Monitoring and Tracking activities and offers effective communication
   and controlling with owners, security units or police. It can send email
   to the owner on his mobile to have fast response especially if the car
   is nearby. Information about the property and the picture of the
   intruder will be sent to user, security unit or police. This will help
   police or security authorities in tracking property or car using GPS
   system that can be link to Google Earth and other mapping software. The
   implementation and testing results show the success of prototype in
   sending email to owner and receiving acknowledgment to the security unit
   or police within 3-4 minutes. The timing and results are suitable to
   owner, security unit, or police to take suitable action against
   intruder.},

Abstract = {Fraudulent emails, otherwise known as phishing emails, use a range of
   influence techniques to persuade individuals to respond, such as
   promising a monetary reward or invoking a sense of urgency. The current
   study explored a number of factors that may impact the persuasiveness
   and trustworthiness of emails by examining participant judgements of 20
   pre-designed emails that varied according to (a) whether they used loss
   or reward-based influence techniques, (b) whether they contained
   particular authentic design cues, (c) whether they referenced a salient
   current event (the Rio Olympics), and (d) whether participants had been
   previously exposed to information regarding online scams in general.
   Results suggest that the presence of authentic design cues and the type
   of influence technique used significantly impacted participant
   judgements. Findings are discussed in relation to theoretical models of
   phishing susceptibility.},

Abstract = {Organisational information and data must be protected from active and

   case study approach, this research found that the information security
   focus areas included in this organisation ISPs are password management;
   use of email, the Internet and social networking sites; mobile

Abstract = {Online examinations are an integral component of many online learning
   environments, which face many security challenges. Collusion is seen as
   a major security threat to such examinations, when a student invites a
   third party to impersonate or abet in a test. This work aims to
   strengthen the authentication of students via the use of dynamic profile
   questions. The study reported in this paper involved 31 online
   participants from five countries over a five-week period. The results of
   usability and security analysis are reported. The dynamic profile
   questions were more usable than both the text-based and image-based
   questions (p < 0.01). An impersonation abuse scenario was simulated
   using email and mobile phone. The impersonation attack via email was not
   successful, however, students were able to share answers to dynamic
   profile questions with a third party impersonator in real time, which
   resulted in 93\% correct answers. The sharing of information via phone
   took place in real time during an online test and the response time of
   an impersonator was significantly different (p < 0.01) than a student.
   The study also revealed that a response time factor may be implemented
   to identify and report impersonation attacks.},

Abstract = {Next-generation service-oriented architectures provide a means for
   unprecedented levels of collaboration. Security built upon LDAPv3 when
   coupled with virtual private database technology can enable secure
   operations within a domain while retaining need-to-know thresholds with
   fine-grain security. This paper discusses such a technology in use for
   navnetwarcom trident warrior experimentation. A simulated scenario is
   discussed in which 12 officers involved in a mhq with moc in mda
   scenario prototyped an operational application of a comprehensive suite
   of xml web services that provided a personalised portal for each user,
   email, chat, presence, instant messenger, web conference, threaded
   discussions, and secured virtual workspaces with libraries, discussion
   area, and task management. The focus was on methods to secure
   communications across military, civilian and coalition operations
   preliminary to more extensive testing to occur in Trident Warrior 07.
   Along with an introduction to the technology the study results are
   presented, addressing methodology and protocols for highly collaborative
   sessions with varying levels of security in highly dynamic scenarios.},

Abstract = {With the rise of digital communication, phishing has emerged as the
   predominant cybercrime. Automated detection systems encounter challenges
   such as user trust issues and false positives, while human-centric
   solutions are resource-intensive and struggle with sophisticated
   attacks. Despite this threat, research on empowering users with
   automatic anti-phishing systems remains limited. This paper introduces a
   human-centric framework that utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to
   extract phishing indicators and generate meaningful warnings.
   Recognizing that certain information is unique to users, our system
   integrates user insights into anti-phishing measures. Preliminary
   results demonstrate the promise of LLM-driven approaches in crafting
   meaningful warnings, highlighting the synergy between human insight and
   machine intelligence in combating phishing. Our framework achieves over
   80\% effectiveness in identifying phishing semantics with no false
   positives or negatives, indicating high precision. This research
   represents a significant advancement in phishing defense, offering a
   nuanced and effective email security approach.},

   secure email and IPsec has been hampered by the difficulties involved in
   establishing a large scale public key infrastructure, or PKI.
   Identity-based cryptography (IBC) can be used to ameliorate some of this
   problem. However, current approaches to using IBC for email or IPsec
   require a global, trusted key distribution center. In this paper, we
   present DNSIBC, a system that captures many of the advantages of using
   IBC, without requiring a global trust infrastructure. The resulting
   system can be configured to require almost no user intervention to
   secure both email and IP-based network traffic. We have built a
   preliminary implementation of this system in Linux.},

Abstract = {Cloud computing is a rapidly growing model of computation. It is the
   delivery of computing services by shared resources, software and
   information over the network (Internet or Intranet). It allows user to
   store large amount of data in cloud storage and use as when required
   from any part of the world by networks. Cloud computing is network based
   technology since security issues like privacy, data security,
   confidentiality etc. are encountered. It has a number of users, who are
   using cloud services like social network, email, file -sharing and other
   which are increasing the data load in cloud storage regularly. It is
   also increasing the risk of data vulnerability. Therefore, the data
   security must be provided in cloud computing models. There are some
   solutions proposed, to resolve these issues, based on encryption
   techniques. The main contribution of this paper is to perform a study of
   different solutions to provide data security and privacy in existing
   cloud computing scenario.},

Abstract = {With the continuous development of mobile Internet, the damage due to
   mobile security incidents is motivating system and security application
   to adopt protective mechanisms. Recent research has begun to focus on
   the correlation between personality traits and security-related behavior
   such as email phishing response. In practical instances of this security
   domain knowledge, acquiring the user's personality accurately and
   conveniently in a mobile environment is desired. In this paper,
   considering the high efficiency of speech personality assessment, a
   prevention model using speech personality traits is proposed to
   guarantee customized security services. Our model is based on multilayer
   perceptron and prosodic features selection to acquire user speech
   personality traits. Furthermore, by combining obtained personality
   traits and security-related behavior domain knowledge, a prevention
   strategy is proposed. The proposed prevention strategy, which design is
   based on the correlation between user personality profile and security
   behavior weaknesses, is used to provide customized security prevention
   services. The results showed that the proposed model can achieve
   superior performance than other state-of-the-art speech personality
   assessment method and guarantee customized security-related behavior
   prevention support according to personality traits. The assessment time
   on mobile terminals is reduced to 19.2\% of the traditional
   questionnaire method.},

Abstract = {Healthcare Informatics affirm that healthcare presents most problems of
   user control with disparate, individualized and often vulnerable users
   having little information with which to assess service quality and
   little choice, at least within the formal hospital sector. Also,
   consultative experience in many Healthcare Organization (HCO) IT
   environments strongly suggests that technical security fundamentals are
   consistently neglected. Integrated network and systems architectures
   provide the means for healthcare to get out of this predicament in the
   age of the wily hacker. More than ever, healthcare and financial
   organizations require comprehensive, easy-to-deploy solutions for
   protecting private data within the email system. Security in healthcare
   information systems is among the highest priority research areas as part
   of the new security framework for HIPAA-compliant healthcare
   information. This paper appraises security concerns in healthcare
   information systems and concludes that what is needed is an approach
   that firmly cements the foundations for a sustainable and efficient
   healthcare system based on solidarity and built to cope with the
   emerging threats. The model emerging from this approach would require a
   robust security infrastructure to support authentication,
   confidentiality, and data integrity so that there is no single point of
   failure that, if compromised, Would give access to all the information.},

Abstract = {Users commonly download, patch, and use applications such as email
   clients, office applications, and media-players from the Internet. Such
   applications are run with the users full permissions. Because system
   protections do not differentiate applications, any malcode present in
   the downloaded software can compromise or otherwise leak all user data.
   Interestingly, our investigations indicate that common applications
   often adhere to recognizable workflows on user data. In this paper we
   take advantage of this reality by developing protection mechanisms that
   ``pin{''} user files to the applications that may use them. These
   mechanisms restrict access to user data to explicitly stated
   workflows-thus preventing malcode from exploiting user data not
   associated with that application. We describe our implementation of
   PinUP on the Linux Security Modules frameswork, explore its performance,
   and study several practical use cases. Through these activities, we show
   that user data can be protected from untrusted applications while
   retaining the ability to receive the benefits of those applications.},

Abstract = {Organizations invest heavily in technology solutions to enhance their
   cybersecurity, yet it is often human factors, like an employee clicking
   on a phishing link, that can derail even the most sophisticated security
   systems. Applying dual-process theories of cognition, we argue that a
   brief mindfulness practice may prevent habitual responding to phishing
   attempts by enhancing rational decision making and hence detecting
   phishing cues. To empirically investigate this idea, we manipulated
   mindfulness between two groups of participants in an experiment, and
   measured the ability to detect phishing cues that are easy or difficult
   to notice in emails from familiar or unfamiliar sources. Our findings
   suggest that mindfulness helps to detect more phishing cues when emails
   are difficult and from familiar sources, but not in any of the other
   experimental conditions. Subsequently, we draw theoretical implications
   for the role of human factors in cybersecurity behavior, and offer
   practical suggestions for security training.},

Title = {Hacking the Human: The Prevalence Paradox in Cybersecurity},
Journal = {HUMAN FACTORS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {60},
Number = {5},
Pages = {597-609},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Objective: This work assesses the efficacy of the prevalence effect as a
   form of cyberattack in human-automation teaming, using an email task.
   Background: Under the prevalence effect, rare signals are more difficult
   to detect, even when taking into account their proportionally low
   occurrence. This decline represents diminished human capability to both
   detect and respond. As signal probability (SP) approaches zero, accuracy
   exhibits logarithmic decay. Cybersecurity, a context in which the
   environment is entirely artificial, provides an opportunity to
   manufacture conditions enhancing or degrading human performance, such as
   prevalence effects. Email cybersecurity prevalence effects have not
   previously been demonstrated, nor intentionally manipulated.
   Method: The Email Testbed (ET) provides a simulation of a clerical email
   work involving messages containing sensitive personal information. Using
   the ET, participants were presented with 300 email interactions and
   received cyberattacks at rates of either 1\%, 5\%, or 20\%.
   Results: Results demonstrated the existence and power of prevalence
   effects in email cybersecurity. Attacks delivered at a rate of 1\% were
   significantly more likely to succeed, and the overall pattern of
   accuracy across declining SP exhibited logarithmic decay.
   Application: These findings suggest a prevalence paradox within
   human-machine teams. As automation reduces attack SP, the human operator
   becomes increasingly likely to fail in detecting and reporting attacks
   that remain. In the cyber realm, the potential to artificially inflict
   this state on adversaries, hacking the human operator rather than
   algorithmic defense, is considered. Specific and general information
   security design countermeasures are offered.},

Abstract = {Anonymity networks allow messaging with meta-data privacy, providing
   better privacy than popular encrypted messaging applications. However,
   contacting a user on an anonymity network currently requires knowing
   their public key or similar high-entropy information, as these systems
   lack a privacy-preserving mechanism for contacting a user via a short,
   human-readable username. Previous research suggests that this is a
   barrier to widespread adoption.
   In this paper we propose Pudding, a novel private user discovery
   protocol that allows a user to be contacted on an anonymity network
   knowing only their email address. Our protocol hides contact
   relationships between users, prevents impersonation, and conceals which
   usernames are registered on the network. Pudding is Byzantine fault
   tolerant, remaining available and secure as long as less than one third
   of servers are crashed, unavailable, or malicious. It can be deployed on
   Loopix and Nym without changes to the underlying anonymity network
   protocol, and it supports mobile devices with intermittent network
   connectivity. We demonstrate the practicality of Pudding with a
   prototype using the Nym anonymity network. We also formally define the
   security and privacy goals of our protocol and conduct a thorough
   analysis to assess its compliance with these definitions.},

Abstract = {Single Sign-On (SSO) has been widely adopted for online authentication
   due to its favorable usability and security. However, it also introduces
   a single point of failure since all service providers fully trust the
   identity of a user created by the SSO identity provider. In this paper,
   we investigate the identity-account inconsistency threat, a new SSO
   vulnerability that can cause the compromise of online accounts. The
   vulnerability exists because current SSO systems highly rely on a user's
   email address to bind an account with a real identity, but ignore the
   fact that email addresses might be reused by other users. We reveal that
   under the SSO authentication, such inconsistency allows an adversary
   controlling a reused email address to take over associated online
   accounts without knowing any credentials like passwords. Specifically,
   we first conduct a measurement study on the account management policies
   for multiple cloud email providers, showing the feasibility of acquiring
   previously used email accounts. We further perform a systematic study on
   100 popular websites using the Google business email service with our
   own domain address and demonstrate that most online accounts can be
   compromised by exploiting this inconsistency vulnerability. To shed
   light on email reuse in the wild, we analyze the commonly used naming
   conventions that lead to a wide existence of potential email address
   collisions, and conduct a case study on the account policies of U.S.
   universities. Finally, we propose several useful practices for
   end-users, service providers, and identity providers to protect against
   this identity-account inconsistency threat.},

Abstract = {In the conventional design of home security systems, only the property
   is typically monitored, without taking into consideration the physical
   control aspects of the house itself. Besides, the term security is not
   strictly well defined in view of the fact that there is usually a time
   delay between the alarm system going on and actual arrival of the
   security personnel. This paper presents the development of a home
   security and monitoring system that is suitable where the traditional
   security systems that are mostly concerned about curbing burglary,
   gathering evidence against trespassing and so on fail. The design and
   implementation details of this new home control and security system
   which is based on field programmable gate array has been discussed in
   the subject paper. The user here can interact directly with the system
   through a web-based interface over the Internet, while home appliances
   like air conditioners, lights, door locks, and gates are controlled
   remotely through a user-friendly web page. An additional feature that
   enhances the security aspect of the system is its capability to monitor
   entry points such as doors and windows so that in the event of any
   breach, an alerting email message could be sent to the home owner
   instantly.},

Abstract = {Bring Your Own Device is the phenomenon that gained popularity since
   2009 when CISCO upon realising mobility of its employees adopted it.
   Also, IT consumerisation fuelled the adoption of BYOD. Employers
   allowing their employees to use their personally owned mobile devices is
   claimed to increase institutions production, reduce cost of IT device
   maintenance as well as reduced cost of buying IT devices. Even though,
   the list of BYOD benefits to both the employer and the employees are
   countless, BYOD has been seen by researchers and organizations that have
   adopted it as the risky program to the organisations' information
   security. Data loss, device and application management, mobile device
   loss and malicious application installation constitute the dominating
   BYOD risks globally. Like all technology enabled nations, many companies
   in Lesotho allow their employees to use their personally owned mobile
   devices to perform work related activities such as email access, company
   network access, storage of company sensitive information and many
   others, this trend is known as Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). However, to
   ascertain their risk in relation to known challenges, an explorative
   qualitative study using a case study strategy was conducted with the
   main objective of assessing the information security risks presented by
   BYOD adoption to organizations in Lesotho. Open ended questions were
   developed and administered through face to face interviews and an online
   semi-structured interview using Survey Monkey. Interviews with 9
   employees from X were conducted and questionnaires were shared with 25
   IT employees of 5 different companies in Lesotho where 15 from 25 people
   responded to the online questions. The results obtained from the study
   illustrate where Lesotho as a country lies in relation to information
   security and adoption of BYOD in business operations. Risks identified
   include loss of confidential information, malware, mobile device loss,
   mingling of information and lack of BYOD policy. Based on the revealed
   landscape, BYOD information security risks and mitigations are
   discussed, and recommendations are presented on the best strategy that
   the organisations can adopt to handle BYOD information security risks
   within their boundaries.},

Abstract = {Background: Inadequate recruitment and retention impede clinical trial
   goals. Emerging decentralized clinical trials (DCTs) leveraging digital
   health technologies (DHTs) for remote recruitment and data collection
   aim to address barriers to participation in traditional trials. The
   ACTIV-6 trial is a DCT using DHTs, but participants' experiences of such
   trials remain largely unknown. This study explored participants'
   perspectives of the ACTIV-6 DCT that tested outpatient COVID-19
   therapeutics.Methods: Participants in the ACTIV-6 study were recruited
   via email to share their day-to-day trial experiences during 1-hour
   virtual focus groups. Two human factors researchers guided group
   discussions through a semi-structured script that probed expectations
   and perceptions of study activities. Qualitative data analysis was
   conducted using a grounded theory approach with open coding to identify
   key themes.Results: Twenty-eight ACTIV-6 study participants aged 30+
   years completed a virtual focus group including 1-4 participants each.
   Analysis yielded three major themes: perceptions of the DCT experience,
   study activity engagement, and trust. Participants perceived the use of
   remote DCT procedures supported by DHTs as an acceptable and efficient
   method of organizing and tracking study activities, communicating with
   study personnel, and managing study medications at home. Use of social
   media was effective in supporting geographically dispersed participant
   recruitment but also raised issues with trust and study
   legitimacy.Conclusions: While participants in this qualitative study
   viewed the DCT-with-DHT approach as reasonably efficient and engaging,
   they also identified challenges to address. Understanding facilitators
   and barriers to DCT participation and DHT interaction can help improve
   future research design.},

Abstract = {End-to-end message encryption is the only way to achieve absolute
   message privacy. However, searching over end-to-end encrypted messages
   is complicated. Several popular instant messaging tools (e.g., WhatsApp,
   iMessage) circumvent this inconvenience by storing the search index
   locally on the devices. Another approach, called searchable encryption,
   allows users to search encrypted messages without storing the search
   index locally. These approaches have inherent tradeoffs between
   usability and security properties, yet little is known about how general
   users value these tradeoffs, especially in the context of email rather
   than instant messaging. In this paper, we systematize these tradeoffs in
   order to identify key feature differences. We use these differences as
   the basis for a choice-based conjoint analysis experiment focused on
   email (n=160), in which participants make a series of choices between
   email services with competing features. The results allow us to quantify
   the relative importance of each feature. We find that users indicate
   high relative importance for increasing privacy and minimizing local
   storage requirements. While privacy is more important overall, local
   storage is more important than adding additional marginal privacy after
   an initial improvement. These results suggest that local indexing, which
   provides more privacy, may often be appropriate for encrypted email, but
   that searchable encryption, which limits local storage, may also hold
   promise for some users.},

Abstract = {As the increasing development of online social networks (OSNs),
   spammers' attentions have been attracted from the traditional email
   field. Nowadays, advertisements, deception messages, illegal contents
   are prevalent in all kinds of ONSs. They're propagated from one to
   another arbitrarily, polluting the Internet environment, and what's
   more, resulting in a great many of security problems. Some previous
   works have been proposed to detect spammers according to user
   properties. The problem is that in order to prevent from being detected,
   spammers are likely to pretend to be normal, and what's more, some
   normal users also engage into spam spreading for financial benefits,
   making detection more difficult. In this paper, we solve the detection
   problem from the view of user influence. The basic of our work is that
   since spammers pretend to be normal, their influences should keep step
   with their normal behaviors. But when a spam campaign is launched,
   usually in order to influent others, a great many of spammers engaged
   into propagation, the original poster's influence would get a sudden
   increase, making him outstanding from the others. In this way, we can
   distinguish the original spammers and supervise from the root of the
   propagation tree. Our work is experimented on real data gathered from
   Weibo and shows inspiring results.},

Abstract = {Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) has long been the primary IETF standard for
   encrypting email, but suffers from widespread usability and security
   problems that have limited its adoption. As time has marched on, the
   underlying cryptographic protocol has fallen out of date insofar as PGP
   is unauthenticated on a per message basis and compresses before
   encryption. There have been an increasing number of attacks on the
   increasingly outdated primitives and complex clients used by the PGP
   eco-system. However, attempts to update the OpenPGP standard have failed
   at the IETF except for adding modern cryptographic primitives. Outside
   of official standardization, Autocrypt is a ``bottom-up{''} community
   attempt to fix PGP, but still falls victim to attacks on PGP involving
   authentication. The core reason for the inability to ``fix{''} PGP is
   the lack of a simple AEAD interface which in turn requires a
   decentralized public key infrastructure to work with email. Yet even if
   standards like MLS replace PGP, the deployment of a decentralized PKI
   remains an open issue.},

Abstract = {As a major component of online crime, emailbased fraud is a threat that
   causes substantial economic losses every year. To counteract these
   scammers, volunteers called scam-baiters play the roles of victims,
   reply to scammers, and try to waste their time and attention with long
   and unproductive conversations. To curb email fraud and magnify the
   effectiveness of scam-baiting, we developed and deployed an expandable
   scam-baiting mailserver that can conduct scam-baiting activities
   automatically. We implemented three reply strategies using three
   different models and conducted a one-month-long experiment during which
   we elicited 150 messages from 130 different scammers. We compare the
   performance of each strategy at attracting and holding the attention of
   scammers, finding tradeoffs between human-written and
   automatically-generated response strategies. We also demonstrate that
   scammers can be engaged concurrently by multiple servers deploying these
   strategies in a second experiment, which used two server instances to
   contact 92 different scammers over 12 days. We release both our platform
   and a dataset containing conversations between our automatic
   scam-baiters and real human scammers, to support future work in
   preventing online fraud.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, remote control applications via the Internet are going to be
   used more and more widely with the development of powerful chips and
   network technology. For applications which do not need real-time
   communication or persistent connection and have a little amount of data
   transportation, conventional approaches based on Web services either are
   a little bit complex, or have a higher overhead. In this paper we
   introduce another method called WeeRMES, a Web services based email
   extension for remote monitoring of embedded systems, to be supplement of
   conventional remote control methods in some special occasions. Thanks to
   the model, we are able to do all those things using emails such as
   sending devices instructions, inspecting device status and gathering
   data using XML capsulated messages. User interfaces can be dynamically
   achieved by means of XForms generated by Java classes loaded on target
   devices. Furthermore, researches are carried out on security mechanism
   to ensure safety and robustness of the system. An idiographic
   implementation is given as an example in the end.},

Abstract = {Traditional security systems have largely focused on attack detection.
   Unfortunately, accurately identifying the latest attack has proven to be
   a never-ending cycle. In this paper, we propose a way to break this
   cycle by ensuring that a system's behavior matches the user's intent.
   Since our approach is attack agnostic, it will scale better than
   traditional security systems.
   There are two key components to our approach. First, we capture the
   user's intent through their interactions with an application. Second, we
   verify that the resulting system output can be mapped back to the user's
   interactions. To demonstrate how this works we created Gyrus, a research
   prototype that observes user interactions for common tasks such as
   sending email, instant messaging, online social networking, and online
   financial services. Gyrus secures these applications from malicious
   behavior such as spam and wire fraud by allowing only outgoing traffic
   with content that matches the user's intent. To understand how Gyrus
   captures user intent, consider the case of a text-based application. In
   this case the user's input is displayed on the screen so the user can
   confirm that their input is correct. Gyrus builds on this concept by
   focusing on what is being displayed to the user instead of what the user
   has typed or clicked. We call this the ``what you see is what you send
   (WYSIWYS){''} policy. We implemented Gyrus under a standard
   virtualization environment, and our prototype system successfully stops
   malware from sending unintended content over the network. Our evaluation
   shows that Gyrus is very efficient and introduces no noticeable delay to
   a users' interaction with the protected applications.},

Abstract = {Cloud Data Security is gaining more and more attention from enterprises
   and users. Email security may be the most highlighted, since the past
   and archived cloud data is under risk of compromising privacy. However,
   the traditional cryptology method cannot meet the security demand in
   privacy protection. Data self-destruction is the ultimate way to protect
   the security and privacy of data. Our research aims at protect the
   privacy of past and archived cloud data, such as emails remained in
   cloud service provider. This article proposes a self-destructing data
   method to realize the self-destruction of cloud data, and apply it to
   the implementation of self-destructing email system. In this method,
   split cipher data with key are distributed in storage called privacy
   cloud. Consequently, the system achieves the aim of data
   self-destruction and has good user experience. In the article,
   comparative analysis and performance measurement show that the scheme is
   able to satisfy the application demands.},

Abstract = {In an enterprise, managing and processing an electronic contract often
   involves a number of contract administrators and representatives in the
   enterprise, and their counter parts in their suppliers, business
   partners or their customers to carry out a large number of complex
   manual tasks in sequences during the life cycle of electronic contract.
   In most commercially available electronic contract management systems,
   users either waste a lot of their time in monitoring their task lists
   for their turns to act on their electronic contracts or most electronic
   contracts simply stay idle for most of the time if users only check
   their task lists once a while. In addition, these manual tasks are often
   tedious and may cause security faults.
   In this paper, we present a Web-based and email driven electronic
   contract management system that supports both internal and
   intra-enterprises workflows, and with multi-tenants hosting capability.
   This system enables a user to act on the next task in a sequence of
   tasks to process a particular electronic contract immediately after the
   other user has completed the previous task in the same sequence of tasks
   by sending out email notifications to alert or remind the user to take
   action on the task. We also describe several novel methods to automate
   some manual and tedious tasks, such as watermarking signature
   information on the signed electronic contract and life cycle management,
   in this paper. Most users have found their productivities improved, the!
   electronic contract transaction time accelerated, contractual errors
   reduced and many other benefits by using this electronic contract
   management system in several IBM pilot programs.},

Abstract = {This Full-paper in the Innovative-Practice Category introduces an
   innovative visual-privacy themed experiential-learning tool, and
   discusses how it is used for building human-privacy plus
   societal-security awareness in middle-school and high-school youth. The
   new GDPR driven business-communications are touching the lives of
   worldwide-consumers, including youth, who use technology-services, like
   Internet and email, from an early age. A lack of privacy-security
   awareness in this context may expose youth. The new CSTA-standards
   advocate for inclusion of privacy, safety, ethics, societal-security and
   human-privacy topics in K-12. Existing literature show multiple
   instances of K-12 research-studies on data-privacy education and
   cybersecurity awareness. However, very few of these explore the
   visual-privacy theme in a way that middle-school and high-school youth
   can learn privacy, security and ethics through the lens of
   privacy-enhancing videosurveillance. This paper presents our simple but
   novel, visually interactive experiential-learning tool, which is based
   upon the PA theme as applicable to visual-media contents. Our unique
   tool introduces young learners to privacy-security concepts, illustrates
   applied-cryptography and discusses privacy-security tradeoffs in
   surveillance-space. The educational application of this tool addresses
   the gap within the current K-12 educational-research work in
   societal-security implications and human-privacy domain. We discuss our
   experimental-studies with this tool, including piloting the tool-based
   hands-on workshop sessions with middle-school and high-school learners,
   as part of GICS and NSA-GenCyber projects. Additionally, we share and
   analyze the learning-assessment data and survey-responses collected from
   participants, in an effort to evaluate the prospects of our
   experiential-learning model as a potential educational and outreach
   medium for engaging and recruiting K-12 students in
   computing-disciplines.},

Abstract = {Security has become a major concern these days especially with the
   burgeoning rate of thefts and crimes. Studies show that homes without
   security systems are more likely to be targeted by burglars than those
   with professionally monitored systems. Security systems are often the
   first line of defense against break-ins. Today, due to the advancements
   in technology and in the Internet of Things (IoT), it is possible to
   envision pervasive connectivity, storage and automation in systems. This
   paper focuses on designing and developing a model of an IoT-Based
   security system for homes, banks and offices in need of security. The
   proposed system has provision for theft and fire detection and sends
   alerts to the user through a text message. It also captures a number of
   snapshots of the intruder and mails it to the user. When compared to the
   other existing systems, the leverage obtained by preferring this system
   is that the user receives alerts irrespective of his location and
   whether or not he is connected to the internet or not. This system also
   consumes less power as the camera is activated and takes snapshots only
   in the presence of an intruder, unlike the CCTV system, where live feed
   is recorded round the clock This system not only notifies the user but
   also the neighbor so that immediate action could be taken.},

Abstract = {Recovery codes are a popular backup mechanism for online services to aid
   users who lost their passwords or two-factor authentication tokens in
   regaining access to their accounts or encrypted data. Especially for
   end-to-end encrypted services, recovery codes are a critical feature, as
   the service itself cannot access the encrypted user data and help users
   regain access. The way end-users manage recovery codes is not well
   understood. Hence, we investigate end-user perceptions and management
   strategies of recovery codes. Therefore, we survey users of an
   end-to-end encrypted email service provider, deploying recovery codes
   for accounts and encrypted data recovery in case of authentication
   credential loss. We performed an online survey with 281 users. In a
   second study, we analyzed 196 support requests on Reddit. Most of our
   participants stored the service provider's recovery code. We could
   identify six strategies for saving it, with using a password manager
   being the most widespread. Participants were generally satisfied with
   the service provider's recovery code. However, while they appreciated
   its security, its usability was lacking. We found obstacles, such as
   losing access to the recovery code or non-functioning recovery codes and
   security misconceptions. These often resulted from users not
   understanding the underlying security implications, e.g., that the
   support cannot access or restore their unencrypted data.},

Abstract = {Local governments in Japan recently provide security information
   services for residents, which deliver regional incident information
   using Email or Web. However, since the conventional services usually
   provide ``one-for-all{''} information. users tend to miss important
   incidents within the flood of information. In this paper, we propose a
   new security information service, called PRISM (Personalized Real-time
   Information with Security Map). For given incident information and
   user's living area, PRISM first computes severity of the incident, based
   on distance, time, and type of the incident. It then visualizes the
   incidents with the severity on a heat map. Thus, PRISM provides
   real-time personalized information adapted to individual situation of
   users. To illustlate the feasibility, we implement PRISM as a Web
   application using Hyogo Bouhan Net, and Kobe city facility open data.},

Abstract = {IP address of a device, from where an offending activity was performed,
   is of limited value, because it does not specify a physical device/user,
   but an endpoint in network. It is useful to have information about where
   a device/user was at the time the offending activity was performed. It
   would be desirable to correlate different pieces of evidence to discover
   information, such as IP addresses used by the same device, physical
   address and location of the device, connection time of the device,
   browsing habits and mail access transactions carried out by the user
   using the device. Log data from various sources are required to be
   correlated together to create contexts of information, which is not
   visible from one source alone. In large networks, users/devices
   accessing a private network repeatedly can be tracked by analyzing and
   correlating DHCP, Network Access Control, WWW, Email server logs. With
   huge amount of logs, the common approach of manual browsing, correlating
   of log events, based on timelines is tedious, unresponsive approach.
   Flat file based sequential search system is not responsive, hence RDBMS
   based tracking systems are desirable. To build a responsive system
   requires identifying, consolidating log files, conversion, transmission
   and storage into relational databases. An automated system has been
   developed at our organization for forensic analysis of network accesses,
   with device and user tracking as its goal. We present, our approach to
   perform log management, correlation, which assists in performing
   responsive forensic analysis of real network with more than 2500 nodes,
   aimed at tracking users/devices.},

Abstract = {Data breaches within an organization have many causes. Social
   engineering attacks, ransom-ware applications and harmful spam email
   messages are data breach catalysts that are the result of human error.
   Human error is the leading cause of data breach and is also one of the
   more difficult factors for an organization to mitigate. Many users are
   unable to see how their role is impacted by organizational security
   policy, and therefor see no benefit to abide the policy. When employees
   use company devices to perform personal tasks, or use personal devices
   to perform business tasks, lines of ownership can be blurred and
   important organizational data assets can be put at risk. Training and
   awareness programs are too often treated as a bandage to fix a wound
   inflicted by a breach after the fact. If employees were trained
   effectively, the breach might not have occurred in the first place. This
   project and accompanying research paper will explore the gamification of
   the security training and awareness program. By developing role-based
   game modules to teach secure behavior to all organizational users,
   incentivizing secure behavior with real rewards that matter to
   participants and applying the training throughout the year, it can be
   possible to reinvent security awareness and prevent future data
   breaches.},

Abstract = {Identity-based encryption (IBE) is one of the important extension of
   public-key encryption (PKE) which can use identities, such as email
   addresses or phone numbers, as public keys. Due to this aspect, IBE can
   reduce the cost of maintaining public key infrastructure. However, it
   has a special issue called the `' key escrow problem `', which means
   that the key generation center (KGC) can decrypt all ciphertexts and get
   all messages in them since it inherently has all user public/private key
   pairs. To tackle this problem, Emura, Katsumata, and Watanabe recently
   proposed a variant of IBE called blind IBE with certified identities by
   introducing identity certifying authority (ICA). Their constructions are
   based on pairing or lattice and secure against chosen plaintext attacks.
   In this paper, we introduce security against chosen ciphertext attacks
   (CCA security) for blind identity-based Encryption with certified
   identities. More precisely, we formalize definitions of 3-types security
   against chosen ciphertext attacks (security against corrupted users,
   KGC, and ICA) for blind IBE with certified identities. Then, we propose
   the first blind IBE with certified identities schemes. Roughly, we
   provide a generic construction by applying the FujisakiOkamoto
   transformation to previous CPA secure Blind IBE with certified
   identities schemes. Through our generic construction, we obtain two
   instantiations based on pairing or lattice. Finally, we implement our
   pairing based scheme and demonstrate that it is practically efficient
   compared with existing schemes.},

Abstract = {Protection of sensitive or classified data from unauthorized access,
   hackers and other personals is virtue. Storage of data is done in
   devices such as USB, external hard disk, laptops, I-Pad or at cloud.
   Cloud computing presents with both ups and downs. However, storing
   information elsewhere increases risk of being attacked by hackers.
   Besides, the risk of losing the device or being stolen is increased in
   case of storage in portable devices. There are array of mediums of
   communications and even emails used to send data or information but
   these technologies come along with severe weaknesses such as absence of
   confidentiality where the message sent can be altered and sent to the
   recipient. No proofs are shown to the recipient that the message
   received is altered. The recipient would not find out unless he or she
   checks with the sender. Without encrypted of data or message, sniffing
   tools and software can be used to hack and read the information since it
   is in plaintext. Therefore, an electronic mail authentication is
   proposed, namely Hybrid Encryption System (HES). The security of HES is
   protected using asymmetric and symmetric key algorithms. The asymmetric
   algorithm is RSA and symmetric algorithm is Advance Encryption Standard.
   With the combination for both algorithms in the HES may provide the
   confidentiality and authenticity to the electronic documents send from
   the sender to the recipient. In a nutshell, the HES will help users to
   protect their valuable documentation and data from illegal third party
   user.},

Abstract = {Demand for new and robust techniques for digital data security and
   privacy are increasing with advancement of digital communication,
   Internet and cloud based storage. Cryptography combined with
   steganography is considered as a good measure of privacy protection
   scheme. However conventionally, steganography deals with the hiding of
   text or audio or image data within one another. For multimedia data like
   image and videos, images are considered to be good carriers. However use
   of image as carrier for hiding plain text data increases the storage
   requirement and transmission bandwidth by multi-fold. Therefore in this
   paper we propose an Unique Data Security using Text Steganography
   (UDSTS) to build a system that is able to transmit and receive encrypted
   messages embedded in rich text Format: {*}.DOC, {*}.RTF, EMAIL /Message
   Body/, etc. The user can choose the fake text and the program tells
   whether this fake text will suit the real text. The user is enabled to
   set different password for every message he sends and therefore two
   different messages can be transmitted to two groups with two different
   passwords using the same fake text.
   Text messages are considered to be harmless and do not trigger a
   scrutiny. Hence the technique provides a very good data protection
   scheme. We also demonstrate that the technique can be adopted to hide
   text message behind different types of files including source codes like
   c++, c\# code. Unlike image steganography, the memory and bandwidth
   requirement are less.},

Abstract = {Insider threats have been categorized as unintentional and malicious.
   The frameworks and models which are used to detect malicious behavior of
   employees would likely fail to detect unintentional insider as there is
   no malicious intent. This paper accentuates the limitation of MERIT
   (Management and Education of Risks of Insider Threat) in its scope for
   accidental insider threats and proposes Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) of the
   security events caused by accidental insiders. We perform FTA on two
   cases involving accidental insiders which help understand human side
   behind the user errors. The first case involves data loss via outbound
   email due to employee error while the second case involves accidental
   disclosure of sensitive information by insiders. The countermeasures are
   thus better interpreted and communicated as the causes of a threat are
   well understood which is essential for human fault avoidance.},

Abstract = {Cloud computing is the recent technology used to share and store the
   computer resources rather than having resources in local server to
   maintain the application. Though cloud is used for a large amount of
   storage, there is no security in cloud. In general, all the groups have
   data owners and data members each should have user name, key, and group
   key. If a user shifts from one group to another, they can easily access
   the information from another group. It leads to a security problem. In
   order to increase security and confidentiality, author generates the new
   group key via Email using Diffie-Hellman algorithm. In case of a new
   user is added or an existing user leaves themselves from the group. The
   data members have to get permission from the data owners in case of any
   data updation. If the user misbehaves, i.e., (DDOS) attack, data owner
   or cloud terminates the user from the group. The updated key is sent to
   the users through Email. This mechanism significantly improves security

Abstract = {Acquiring data from cloud storage services has become increasingly
   important to digital forensic investigations. As more providers offer
   greater online storage facilities and user data is synchronised across
   multiple devices, an abundance of data sources has become available to
   assist with forensic investigations. However, such data can only become
   evidence when there is a thorough understanding of the data dynamics
   between client devices and the cloud, and there are explanations for any
   variations. This paper documents and analyses the artefacts created by
   interactions between Apple's cloud service, email, and contacts
   applications. An explanation of why some artefacts synchronised over the
   cloud do not have matching cryptographic hashes is offered, and the
   ability to establish email origin on a system of multiple devices
   sharing a single account is established.},

   underscores the importance of safeguarding email systems, prompting
   scholars across diverse fields to delve deeper into this subject. The
   primary objective of this research is to mitigate the disruptive effects
   of spam on email usage by introducing improved security measures

   development of a novel spam filtering technique designed to prevent spam
   from infiltrating users' inboxes. Consequently, a hybrid filtering

   Classifier, is proposed, denoted as GWO-NBC. This research is rigorously
   tested using the WEKA software and the SPAMBASE dataset. Thorough
   performance evaluations demonstrated that the proposed approach
   surpasses existing solutions in terms of both security and accuracy.},

Abstract = {This article describes how local governments in Japan recently provide
   security information services for residents, which deliver regional
   incident information using Email or Web. However, since the conventional
   services usually provide ``one-for-all{''} information. users tend to
   miss important incidents within the flood of information. This article
   proposes a new security information service, called PRISM (Personalized
   Real-time Information with Security Map). For given incident information
   and user's living area, PRISM first computes severity of the incident,
   based on distance, time, and type of the incident. It then visualizes
   the incidents with the severity on a heat map. Thus, PRISM provides
   real-time personalized information adapted to individual situation of
   users. To illustrate the feasibility, we implement PRISM as a Web
   application using Hyogo Bouhan Net, and Kobe city facility open data.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we introduce an algorithm to generate emerging images
   which can be used to implement Human Interaction Proofs (HIPs) based on
   this kind of images. In a general setting we propose the design of
   proofs easy to solve by human beings but hard to solve by computer
   algorithms. These tests are able to tell apart human from bots (or
   robots) in order to protect online environments (as social networks,
   wikis, ticket sellers, free-email providers, etc) from different kind of
   security threats.
   Our proposal uses tools and techniques arising from TDA (point clouds,
   simplicial complexes and spatial triangulation among others), in order
   to create shapes which can be identified by humans as recognizable
   images hard to detect by machines.},

Abstract = {Visual appeal has been shown to influence perceptions of usability and
   credibility, and we hypothesize that something similar is happening with
   user judgments of website security: What is beautiful is secure. Web
   certificates provide reliable information about a website's level of
   security, presented in browser interfaces. Users should use this to
   inform their trust decisions online, but evidence from laboratory
   studies and real-world usage suggests that they do not. We conducted two
   studies-one in lab, and one online-in which participants view and
   interact with websites with high and low visual appeal, and various
   security levels, and then make security-related judgments. In both
   studies, participants consistently rated visually appealing websites as
   more secure, and indicated they would be more likely to enter sensitive
   information into visually appealing websites-even when they were less
   secure. Our results provide evidence that users rely on visual appeal
   when making security and trust decisions on websites. We discuss how
   these results may be used to help users.},

Abstract = {Browser extensions are widely used nowadays to customize users' browsers
   with more functionalities, meanwhile introduce potential risks due to
   escalated privileges. Existing security mechanisms, such as Same Origin
   Policy and Content Security Policy, do not apply to browser extensions
   that can read and write on web applications at any time. In spite of the
   state-of-the-art industrial efforts that rely on centralized management
   to inspect and detect malicious behaviors massively, the detection-based
   method cannot analyze fast-evolving behaviors of malicious browser
   extensions. To this end, we adopt a novel approach to protect users from
   malicious browser extensions, where we consider the problem of malicious
   extensions on the side of web applications. From a high level point of
   view, web developers are allowed to specify sensitive parts in a web
   application by using our provided software enclave. With our proposed
   WebEnclave extension installed, when users visit a web application,
   sensitive information required for the web application to work normally
   is sealed into an isolated world locally that malicious extensions
   cannot access. Extensive evaluation of our built prototype shows it can
   effectively protect user secrets from malicious extensions with
   negligible performance overhead and usability inconvenience. We also
   publish source codes for public use.},

Abstract = {A common security practice used to deal with a password breach is
   locking user accounts and sending out an email to tell users that they
   need to reset their password to unlock their account. This paper
   evaluates the effectiveness of this security practice based on the
   password reset email that LinkedIn sent out around May 2016, and through
   an online survey conducted on 249 LinkedIn users who received that
   email. Our evaluation shows that only about 46\% of the participants
   reset their passwords. The mean time taken to reset password was 26 : 3
   days, revealing that a significant proportion of the participants reset
   their password a few weeks, or even months after first receiving the
   email. Our findings suggest that more effective persuasive measures need
   to be added to convince users to reset their password in a timely
   manner, and further reduce the risks associated with delaying password
   resets.},

Abstract = {Unstructured textual data has increased to unprecedented levels with the
   rapid spread of user generated content via social media. Handling large
   volumes of unstructured text data is a challenging task that is
   increasingly becoming needed in a variety of situations. Reading and
   extracting important information from large collections of text manually
   is impractical and often impossible. This research concerns making sense
   of 500,000 email submissions received in response to a debate on Net
   Neutrality in India. The large volume of HTML format data was
   preprocessed using natural language processing (NLP) before analyzing
   it. Topic modeling and sentiment analysis were used to explore the
   nature and scope of the submissions so received, and provided a
   framework for dealing with this increasingly recurring problem.
   Interesting topics were identified from the submissions by using the
   Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model, which included themes
   such as the speed of internet, security, privacy and internet traffic
   among others. Word clouds were then generated to visualize key concepts
   within these email responses. A lexicon-based approach was used to
   classify the sentiment polarity of responses as positive, negative and
   neutral. Two methods were used to classify polarity of responses. In the
   first method, negative and positive word lists were used to classify
   polarity. There was considerable accuracy in the classification results.
   In the second method, the SentiWordNet lexical resource was used for
   classification and resulted in improved performance.},

Abstract = {Phishing causes billions of dollars in damage every year and poses a
   serious threat to the Internet economy. Among the many possible
   communication channels, electronic mail still remains the most commonly
   used medium to launch phishing attacks. In this paper, we present a two
   dimensional approach to detecting phishing emails. We devise two
   independent, unsupervised classifiers, namely the link and header
   classifiers, and two combinations of these classifiers. We show that or
   schemes significantly outperform the previous unsupervised and
   supervised phishing detection schemes for emails in the literature. We
   also utilize contextual information, when available, to detect phishing.
   Finally, our protocol is designed to detect phishing at the email level
   rather than detecting fraudulent, masqueraded websites. Our
   implementation framework called PhishSnag, operates between a user's
   mail transfer agent (MTA) and mail user agent (MUA) and processes each
   arriving email for phishing attacks even before reaching the inbox.},

Abstract = {This work presents a collection of methods that is used to effectively
   identify users of computers systems based on their particular usage of
   the software and the network. Not only are we able to identify
   individual computer users by their behavioral patterns, we are also able
   to detect significant deviations in their typical computer usage over
   time, or compared to a group of their peers. For instance, most people
   have a small, and relatively unique selection of regularly visited
   websites, certain email services, daily work hours, and typical
   preferred applications for mandated tasks. We argue that these habitual
   patterns are sufficiently specific to identify fully anonymized network
   users.
   We demonstrate that with only a modest data collection capability,
   profiles of individual computer users can be constructed so as to
   uniquely identify a profiled user from among their peers. As time
   progresses and habits or circumstances change, the methods presented
   update each profile so that changes in user behavior can be reliably
   detected over both abrupt and gradual time frames, without losing the
   ability to identify the profiled user.
   The primary benefit of our methodology allows one to efficiently detect
   deviant behaviors, such as subverted user accounts, or organizational
   policy violations. Thanks to the relative robustness, these techniques
   can be used in scenarios with very diverse data collection capabilities,
   and data privacy requirements. In addition to behavioral change
   detection, the generated profiles can also be compared against
   pre-defined examples of known adversarial patterns.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAR 12},
Abstract = {Background: With high rates of temporary workers and a transient worker
   population, the U.S. construction workforce presents a challenge for
   long-term research and outreach activities. Increasing availability of
   affordable cell phone technologies may provide an opportunity for
   research follow-up among construction workers once they leave the
   worksite. Using pilot study survey data we characterize and examine the
   association of cell phone technology ownership and cellular text/email
   services among a non-probabilistic sample of payroll and temporary
   construction workers.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used to administer a
   one-time paper-based anonymous survey to construction workers working at
   construction sites in Florida, USA. The survey featured questions on
   sociodemographic characteristics, occupational history, cell phone
   technology ownership, and cellular text/email services capabilities.
   Results: Among the 223 construction worker survey respondents, 31.4\%
   identified as temporary workers and 68.6\% were on payroll and 87.4\%
   owned a cell phone. Construction workers who own a cell phone had
   greater than a high school education (28.9\% vs. 25.0\%; p = 0.019),
   made >\$30,000/year (27.1\% vs. 14.8\%; p = 0.011), had same cell phone
   number for >1 year (74.4\% vs. 40.7\%; p = 0.001), and were employed as
   a payroll worker (71.0\% vs. 50.0\%; p = 0.037). Temporary construction
   workers compared to their payroll counterparts were significantly less
   likely to have email services on their cell phone {[}unadjusted-odds
   ratio 0.41 (95\% CI: 0.17-0.97)].
   Conclusion: Cell phone ownership and smartphone-enabled technologies
   such as email/texting capabilities are higher among payroll than
   temporary construction workers. Further research on frequency of cell
   phone use and types of email/texting services used by construction
   workers are needed.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, Passwords are to identify users of Social Networking Sites
   (SNS). However, there are some downsides to it such as the user
   forgetting their password or the account being hacked by an attacker. To
   retrieve their password, websites are asking for an alternate email
   address or security question. Due to its expanding features and
   popularity, social media has become more vulnerable. It is no secret
   that social media providers leave security to the discretion of users
   during the development, which raises serious concerns. Earlier research
   has been supported by the Protective Motivation Theory (PMT), which
   provides a hypothetical structure for analyzing the protection of
   Internet users. According to the current internet safety search, new
   engines incorporated into a PMT structure for perhaps the first time.
   Adaptation assessment variables, including the strength of behavior, the
   effectiveness of responses, and individual responsibility, were the most
   important predictors of online safety intentions. A multi-factor
   authentication mechanism linked to a trust model used on SNS. The needs,
   actions, and behaviors of users are particularly adaptable to confidence
   systems. The level of threat was also a significant predictor. The
   explanatory power of the standard PMT model with the multi-factor
   authentication technique was raised by 15\% by incorporating new
   components such as past experiences, behavioral control, habitual
   strength, security and safety support, and individual responsibility.
   The results are considered in the advanced evolution of PMT in the
   context of Internet security for home computer users. (c) 2021 Published

Abstract = {The continued acceptance of enhanced security technologies in the
   private sector, such as two-factor authentication, has prompted
   significant changes of organizational security practices. While past
   work has focused on understanding how users in consumer settings react
   to enhanced security measures for banking, email, and more, little work
   has been done to explore how these technological transitions and
   applications occur within organizational settings. Moreover, while many
   corporations have invested significantly to secure their networks for
   the sake of protecting valuable intellectual property, academic
   institutions, which also create troves of intellectual property, have
   fallen behind in this endeavor.
   In this paper, we detail a transition from a token-based, two-factor
   authentication system within an academic institution to an entirely
   digital system utilizing employee-owned mobile devices. To accomplish
   this, we first conducted discussions with staff from the Information
   Security Office to understand the administrative perspective of the
   transition. Second, our key contribution is the analysis of an in-depth
   survey to explore the perceived benefits and usability of the novel
   technological requirements from the employee perspective. In particular,
   we investigate the implications of the new authentication system based
   on employee acceptance or opposition to the mandated technological
   transition, with a specific focus on the utilization of personal devices
   for workplace authentication.},

Abstract = {Physician-patient email communication is gaining popularity. However, a
   formal assessment of physicians' email communication skills has not been
   described. We hypothesized that the email communication skills of
   rheumatology fellows can be measured in an objective structured clinical
   examination (OSCE) setting using a novel email content analysis
   instrument which has 18 items. During an OSCE, we asked 50 rheumatology
   fellows to respond to a simulated patient email. The content of the
   responses was assessed using our instrument. The majority of
   rheumatology fellows wrote appropriate responses scoring a mean (+/- SD)
   of 10.6 (+/- 2.6) points (maximum score 18), with high inter-rater
   reliability (0.86). Most fellows were concise (74\%) and courteous
   (68\%) but not formal (22\%). Ninety-two percent of fellows acknowledged
   that the patient's condition required urgent medical attention, but only
   30\% took active measures to contact the patient. No one encrypted their
   messages. The objective assessment of email communication skills is
   possible using simulated emails in an OSCE setting. The variable email
   communication scores and incidental patient safety gaps identified,
   suggest a need for further training and defined proficiency standards
   for physicians' email communication skills.},

Abstract = {A reduction in phishing threats is of increasing importance to
   organizations. One part of this effort is to provide training to
   employees, so that they are able to identify and avoid phishing emails.
   Yet further, simulated phishing emails are used to test whether
   employees will both identify and report a suspicious email. We worked
   with a partner bank to examine a repository of many thousands of
   reported emails from a behavioural perspective. We divide reported
   emails into categories and examine reporting trends over time relative
   to training and phishing simulation campaigns. Among our findings, the
   level of reporting of benign emails is comparable to the number of
   malicious emails reported, and we see indications that training and
   simulations amplify the reporting of benign emails. Our analysis
   uncovers reporting patterns for unique reporters per email campaign as a
   promising indicator for the security-related culture around phishing

Abstract = {Good project management outcomes include completing projects to an
   acceptable level of quality, within budget and on time. As construction
   accidents may cause project delays, safety management plays an important
   role in a project's timely completion. This study aims to undertake a
   comparative study of HR practices adopted for safety management on
   construction projects in the United States (US) and Singapore and to
   investigate the relationship between HR practices and construction
   safety management outcomes (severity and frequency of accidents). The
   research method included exploratory interviews and industry surveys of
   contractors in the US and Singapore by email and post. Data were
   collected using structured questionnaires. Compared to Singapore
   contractors, the results show that US contractors' project management
   practices place significantly more emphasis on highlighting
   organizational safety values to new workers and taking working
   experience into account during the selection process. On the other hand,
   Singapore contractors place more emphasis on providing appropriate rest
   areas for workers. Many HR practices are significantly correlated with
   safety management outcomes. These include: taking age into consideration
   during selection process and giving feedback to workers about their
   unsafe behaviour. It is recommended that project managers adopt relevant
   HR practices that lead to more effective safety management on
   construction projects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. and IPMA. All rights

Abstract = {User privacy has become a prominent issue in the digital age, especially
   with the advent of the Internet and social media. Technologies have
   opened up new opportunities and different ways for us to communicate. At
   the same time, they have also brought other avenues and methods for
   cyberattacks. Email attacks such as the mass sending of malicious
   messages, links, and phishing dominate among them. Therefore, in our
   scientific article, we dealt with the most common type of cyberattacks
   that occur via e-mail. Machine learning methods (ML) have been actively
   involved in malicious email detection. To find out which algorithm is
   more effective, we tested different supervised ML algorithms such as
   Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Naive Bayes,
   and K-Nearest Neighbors. And to work with real data, we used some
   datasets containing emails used in different phishing and bulk emails.},

Title = {Email phishing and signal detection: How persuasion principles and
   personality influence response patterns and accuracy},
Journal = {APPLIED ERGONOMICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {86},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Phishing is a social engineering tactic where a malicious actor
   impersonates a trustworthy third party with the intention of tricking
   the user into divulging sensitive information. Previous social
   engineering research in a real-world setting has shown an interaction
   between the personality of the target and the persuasion principle used.
   This study investigated whether this interaction is present in the realm
   of email phishing. Additionally, a signal detection theory framework was
   used to evaluate how the various persuasion principles influence
   accuracy, sensitivity (d'), and response criterion placement. A
   personality inventory and an email identification task (phishing or
   legitimate) were used. These data support previous findings that high
   extroversion is predictive of increased susceptibility to phishing
   attacks. The various persuasions principles elicited diverse response
   criterions and sensitivities, though all investigated persuasion
   principles resulted in a liberal decision criterion, except one. These
   findings are interpreted and discussed.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) integrates billions of smart devices that
   can communicate with one another with minimal human intervention. IoT is
   one of the fastest developing fields in the history of computing, with
   an estimated 50 billion devices by the end of 2020. However, the
   crosscutting nature of IoT systems and the multidisciplinary components
   involved in the deployment of such systems have introduced new security
   challenges. Implementing security measures, such as encryption,
   authentication, access control, network and application security for IoT
   devices and their inherent vulnerabilities is ineffective. Therefore,
   existing security methods should be enhanced to effectively secure the
   IoT ecosystem. Machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) have advanced
   considerably over the last few years, and machine intelligence has
   transitioned from laboratory novelty to practical machinery in several
   important applications. Consequently, ML/DL methods are important in
   transforming the security of IoT systems from merely facilitating secure
   communication between devices to security-based intelligence systems.
   The goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive survey of ML methods
   and recent advances in DL methods that can be used to develop enhanced
   security methods for IoT systems. IoT security threats that are related
   to inherent or newly introduced threats are presented, and various
   potential IoT system attack surfaces and the possible threats related to
   each surface are discussed. We then thoroughly review ML/DL methods for
   IoT security and present the opportunities, advantages and shortcomings
   of each method. We discuss the opportunities and challenges involved in
   applying ML/DL to IoT security. These opportunities and challenges can
   serve as potential future research directions.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {121916-121929},
Abstract = {Phishing is an online scam where criminals trick users with various
   strategies, with the goal of obtaining sensitive information or
   compromising accounts, systems, and/or other personal or organisational
   Information Technology resources. Multiple studies have shown that human
   factors influence the success of phishing attempts. However, these
   studies were conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic, which is
   significant because security reports show that the numbers of phishing
   attacks have been rapidly increasing since the start of COVID-19. This
   study investigates the extent to which users' fear, anxiety and stress
   levels regarding COVID-19, impact falling for common and COVID-19 themed
   phishing scams during the outbreak period. Prior studies have depicted
   the effects of human behaviour on phishing attacks before the pandemic,
   such as risk-taking preferences and users' demographic factors, hence
   this study also focuses on the effects of those factors on the
   likelihood of phishing victimisation. More concretely, we present the
   results of a scenario-based roleplay experiment to study the
   relationship between fear, anxiety, stress, risk-taking, and demographic
   factors and the success of phishing attacks during the pandemic. The
   findings indicate that fear of COVID-19 influences the success of
   COVID-19 specific themed phishing scams, while anxiety, stress, and
   risk-taking influences the success of both the COVID-19 themed and
   common phishing scams. Our findings also suggest that the users'
   education level impacts common phishing attacks during the pandemic.},

Abstract = {While advances in cyber-security defensive mechanisms have substantially
   prevented malware from penetrating into organizational Information
   Systems (IS) networks, organizational users have found themselves
   vulnerable to threats emanating from Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)
   vectors, mostly in the form of spear phishing. In this respect, the
   question of how an organizational user can differentiate between a
   genuine communication and a similar looking fraudulent communication in
   an email/APT threat vector remains a dilemma. Therefore, identifying and
   evaluating the APT vector attributes and assigning relative weights to
   them can assist the user to make a correct decision when confronted with
   a scenario that may be genuine or a malicious APT vector. In this
   respect, we propose an APT Decision Matrix model which can be used as a
   lens to build multiple APT threat vector scenarios to identify threat
   attributes and their weights, which can lead to systems compromise.},

Abstract = {ObjectivesInternational consensus advises patient safety education (PSE)
   for dental undergraduates. A previous systematic review found no
   articles describing PSE in dentistry. This article aimed to review the
   evidence base for, and the current practice of, PSE in UK dental
   schools.MethodsLiterature search and surveys were sent via email to all
   16 UK dental schools.ResultsSix articles describing PSE interventions
   were found: 2 small-scale studies for dental students and 4
   interprofessional studies. Patient safety education is effective for
   undergraduate dental students with significant improvement in knowledge
   and interest. Interprofessional studies reported improved teamwork
   skills and more positive attitudes toward interprofessional working.The
   2018 and 2021 surveys had response rates of 56\% and 100\%,
   respectively. An increase in integrated formal PSE and assessment in UK
   dental schools is demonstrated. No barriers to implementation were
   reported. Forty-six percent of schools deliver interprofessional PSE,
   38\% deliver human factors, 81\% teach communication, 94\% teach
   professionalism, and 31\% of schools have a patient safety (PS)
   champion.ConclusionsLimited published literature on PSE in dentistry is
   available. However, the lack of published articles does not mean that PS
   is not being taught, as many UK dental schools were found to have formal
   PSE integrated and assessed within their curriculum. Further development
   is needed in terms of appointing PS champions for leadership and human
   factors training. Patient safety must form a part of an undergraduate
   student's core values.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, the explosive growth of unsolicited emails on Internet has
   been challenging the spam filtering systems when at the presence of big
   data. Current spam filters suffer from the following problems: (1) Not
   personalised; (2) Comparatively static association rules defined in the
   firewalls, or gateways; (3) Cannot identify the extremely hidden
   information that mixed in the syntax or semantics. To overcome these
   problems, we develop and implement a new email spamming system leveraged
   by coupled text similarity analysis on user preference and a virtual
   meta-layer user-based email network, we take the social networks or
   campus LANs as the spam social network scenario. Fewer current practices
   exploit social networking initiatives to assist in spam filtering.
   Social network has essentially a large number of accounts features to be
   considered.
   We construct a new model called meta-layer email network which can
   reduce these features by only considering individual user's actions
   i.e., replying network, reading network and deleting network. For the
   first time, these common user actions are considered to construct a
   social behavior-based email network. Further, a coupled selection model
   is developed for this email network, we are able to consider all
   relevant factors/features in a whole and recommend the emails
   practically to the user individually. The experiment data comes from the
   Enron email dataset, which has been recognized as a representative
   dataset for testing and validation. The experimental results show the
   new approach can achieve higher precision and accuracy with better email
   ranking in favor of personalised preference.},

Abstract = {Child pedestrian injury is a preventable global health challenge.
   Successful training efforts focused on child behavior, including
   individualized streetside training and training in large virtual
   pedestrian environments, are laborious and expensive. This study
   considers the usability and feasibility of a virtual pedestrian
   environment ``game{''} application to teach children safe
   street-crossing behavior via the internet, a medium that could be
   broadly disseminated at low cost. Ten 7- and 8-year-old children
   participated. They engaged in an internet-based virtual pedestrian
   environment and completed a brief assessment survey. Researchers rated
   children's behavior while engaged in the game. Both self-report and
   researcher observations indicated the internet-based system was readily
   used by the children without adult support. The youth understood how to
   engage in the system and used it independently and attentively. The
   program also was feasible. It provided multiple measures of pedestrian
   safety that could be used for research or training purposes. Finally,
   the program was rated by children as engaging and educational.
   Researcher ratings suggested children used the program with minimal
   fidgeting or boredom. The pilot test suggests an internet-based virtual
   pedestrian environment offers a usable, feasible, engaging, and
   educational environment for child pedestrian safety training. If future
   research finds children learn the cognitive and perceptual skills needed
   to cross streets safely within it, internet-based training may provide a
   low-cost medium to broadly disseminate child pedestrian safety training.
   The concept may be generalized to other domains of health-related
   functioning such as teen driving safety, adolescent sexual risk-taking,
   and adolescent substance use.},

Abstract = {Account recovery is ubiquitous across web applications but circumvents
   the username/password-based login step. Therefore, it deserves the same
   level of security as the user authentication process. A common
   simplistic procedure for account recovery requires that a user enters
   the same email used during registration, to which a password recovery
   link or a new username could be sent. Therefore, an impostor with access
   to a user's registration email and other credentials can trigger an
   account recovery session to take over the user's account. To prevent
   such attacks, beyond validating the email and other credentials entered
   by the user, our proposed recovery method utilizes keystroke dynamics to
   further secure the account recovery mechanism. Keystroke dynamics is a
   type of behavioral biometrics that uses the analysis of typing rhythm
   for user authentication. Using a new dataset with over 500,000
   keystrokes collected from 44 students and university staff when they
   fill out an account recovery web form of multiple fields, we have
   evaluated the performance of five scoring algorithms on individual
   fields as well as feature-level fusion and weighted-score fusion. We
   achieve the best EER of 5.47\% when keystroke dynamics from individual
   fields are used, 0\% for a feature-level fusion of five fields, and 0\%
   for a weighted-score fusion of seven fields. Our work represents a new
   kind of keystroke dynamics that we would like to call it `medium
   fixed-text' as it sits between the conventional (short) fixed text and
   (long) free text research.},

Abstract = {In recent years, motivated by the revelation of long-term and widespread
   surveillance of personal communications, extensive efforts have been
   putting into store-and-forward asynchronous messaging systems (e.g.,
   email and SMS) for providing critical security guarantees. Of particular
   interest among them is forward security, which makes past messages
   remain secure in the event that the secret key gets exposed. Traditional
   forward-secure public key encryption can provide forward security for
   asynchronous scenarios, but it is not flexible enough for instant
   messaging systems. This is mainly because that, after updating his/her
   secret key, the user totally loses the decryption capacity of
   ciphertexts that have not been received. In this paper, to achieve
   practical forward-security of asynchronous messaging systems, we
   investigate the construction of a new primitive named forward-secure
   puncturable encryption (FSPE) that captures fine-grained forward
   security. Namely, the user can maintain the decryption capacity of those
   encrypted messages that have not been received yet. Meanwhile, even if
   the secret key is disclosed, those received messages can still remain
   secure. Specifically, we propose a communication-efficient FSPE scheme
   for achieving fine-grained forward-secure asynchronous messaging.
   Moreover, to improve the efficiency of asynchronous messaging built upon
   FSPE, we extend it to support outsourced decryption. We also implement
   the proposed scheme and evaluate a proof-of-concept of main algorithms,
   so as to increase confidence on its correctness and practicability.},

Abstract = {Phishing attacks, in which criminals lure Internet users to Web sites
   that spoof legitimate Web sites, are occurring with increasing frequency
   and are causing considerable harm to victims. While a great deal of
   effort has been devoted to solving the phishing problem by prevention
   and detection of phishing emails and phishing Web sites, little research
   has been done in the area of training users to recognize those attacks.
   Our research focuses on educating users about phishing and helping them
   make better trust decisions. We identified a number of challenges for
   end-user security education in general and anti-phishing education in
   particular: users are not motivated to learn about security; for most
   users, security is a secondary task; it is difficult to teach people to
   identify security threats without also increasing their tendency to
   misjudge nonthreats as threats. Keeping these challenges in mind, we
   developed an email-based anti-phishing education system called
   ``PhishGuru{''} and an online game called ``Anti-Phishing Phil{''} that
   teaches users how to use cues in URLs to avoid falling for phishing
   attacks. We applied learning science instructional principles in the
   design of PhishGuru and Anti-Phishing Phil. In this article we present
   the results of PhishGuru and Anti-Phishing Phil user studies that
   demonstrate the effectiveness of these tools. Our results suggest that,
   while automated detection systems should be used as the first line of
   defense against phishing attacks, user education offers a complementary
   approach to help people better recognize fraudulent emails and websites.},

Abstract = {Third-party security apps are an integral part of the Android app
   ecosystem. Many users install them as an extra layer of protection for
   their devices. By installing security apps, the smartphone users place a
   significant amount of trust on them allowing access to many smartphone
   resources that contain personal information such as the storage, text
   messages, email, and browser history. As such, it is essential to
   understand the mobile security apps ecosystem. In this paper, we present
   the first empirical study of Android security apps. We analyse 100
   Android security apps from multiple aspects and offer insights to their
   operations and behaviours. Our results show that 20\% of the security
   apps resell the data they collect to third parties; in some cases, even
   without the user consent. Also, we show that around 50\% of the security
   apps fail to identify known malware.},

Abstract = {The number of instant messages sent per year now exceeds that of email.
   Recently users have been moving away from traditional instant messaging
   applications and instead using social networks as their primary
   communications platform. To discover attitudes related to instant
   messaging and its security, we have conducted a user survey. This paper
   also presents the design of PFC (Private Facebook Chat), a system
   providing convenient, secure instant messaging within Facebook Chat. PFC
   offers end-to-end encryption in order to thwart any eavesdropper,
   including Facebook itself. Finally, we have conducted a usability study

Abstract = {Phishing is recognized as a serious threat to organizations and
   individuals. While there have been significant technical advances in
   blocking phishing attacks, end-users remain the last line of defence
   after phishing emails reach their email inboxes. Most of the existing
   literature on this subject has focused on the technical aspects related
   to phishing. The factors that cause humans to be susceptible to phishing
   attacks are still not well-understood. To fill this gap, we reviewed the
   available literature and systematically categorized the phishing
   susceptibility variables studied. We classify variables based on their
   temporal scope, which led us to propose a three-stage Phishing
   Susceptibility Model (PSM) for explaining how humans are vulnerable to
   phishing attacks. This model reveals several research gaps that need to
   be addressed to understand and improve protection against phishing
   susceptibility. Our reviewalso systematizes existing studies by their
   sample size and generalizability and further suggests a practical impact
   assessment of the value of studying variables: Some more easily lead to
   improvements than others. We believe that this article can provide
   guidelines for future phishing susceptibility research to improve
   experiment design and the quality of findings.},

Abstract = {Before inception of Internet of Things (IoT), personal computers and
   laptop were used to handle daily tasks of individuals like mail surfing,
   access to bank portal, observing current temperature, among others.
   Nowadays, IoTenabled smart devices like smart mobile phones, PDAs, and
   tablets are being used by them for such tasks due to rapid growth in
   IoT. Smart homes have been widely accepted by individuals and
   organizations world wide due to their many advantages. Home security
   systems can be defined as monitoring of complete home/some portion of
   home from a remotely located or centralized location. It allows the user
   to watch all activities inside the home from a remote location that
   ultimately gives satisfaction to the owner of the home. Many home
   security systems exist, but they have some challenging issues like:
   delay, non -web enabled and difficult to handle during transfer of
   alerts to user in situation where any unusual event occurred inside the
   home. If any unusual event encountered inside the home, where security
   systems deployed, then system must be capable enough to send alert to
   the user without any delay by phone, text, or email. Cameras and other
   latest network technologies have enabled us to remotely monitor the home
   more effectively and efficiently from our smart phone. Hence,
   considering the above mentioned facts, in this paper, we have proposed
   an advanced Internet of Thing based Security Alert System for Smart Home
   in order to detect an intruder or any unusual event at home, when nobody
   is available there. This low-cost home security system utilizes a small
   pyroelectric Infrared (PIR) module and raspberry pi for minimizing the
   delay during process of e-mail alert. This paper also confirms the
   advantage of Raspberry Pi flexibility and broad probability of its
   usage. Preliminary analyses have shown encouraging results.},

Abstract = {The pervasiveness of wireless communications networks is advancing
   particularly in metropolitan areas. Broadband computer networks as IEEE
   802.11 are seriously competing with cellular network technologies such
   as UMTS and HSDPA. Unfortunately, this increased mobility comes with
   privacy and security related issues. We are currently in the process of
   identifying possible attacks on the privacy of wireless network users,
   since the development of effective countermeasures is only possible with
   a thorough understanding of such attacks.
   One serious threat we are discussing here, is the tracking of users in
   metropolitan networks by means of determining their physical location.
   Any individual user can be identified either by the devices she is using
   or by the behavior she is displaying. Suitable features range from
   single identifiers such as IP or MAC addresses to complex conglomerates
   of different values that provide valuable information due to their
   combination.
   This article focuses on the extraction and analysis of features that are
   valuable for fingerprinting by employing Activation Patterns, a concept
   based on artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. The
   concept is applied to email header data, since this allows for an
   effective illustration of the employed techniques. Furthermore, due to
   the human understandable data, we can easily evaluate the effectiveness
   of the concept before we start to analyze more complex data-sets.},

Abstract = {Nowaday, emails are used in almost every field, from business to
   education. Emails have two subcategories, i.e., ham and spam. Email
   spam, also called junk emails or unwanted emails, is a type of email
   that can be used to harm any user by wasting his/her time, computing
   resources, and stealing valuable information. The ratio of spam emails
   is increasing rapidly day by day. Spam detection and filtration are
   significant and enormous problems for email and IoT service providers
   nowadays. Among all the techniques developed for detecting and
   preventing spam, filtering email is one of the most essential and
   prominent approaches. Several machine learning and deep learning
   techniques have been used for this purpose, i.e., Naive Bayes, decision
   trees, neural networks, and random forest. This paper surveys the
   machine learning techniques used for spam filtering techniques used in
   email and IoT platforms by classifying them into suitable categories. A
   comprehensive comparison of these techniques is also made based on
   accuracy, precision, recall, etc. In the end, comprehensive insights and
   future research directions are also discussed.},

Abstract = {In the present days, mobile devices like smart phones and iPads are
   being used to handle daily tasks that traditional desktop and laptop
   computers once handled. Home automation can be defined as accessing or
   controlling many of our home appliances, security, climate, and video
   monitoring from a remote or centralized location. A home automation
   system allows us to check in on our home from a remote location, giving
   us true peace of mind. Some systems will let us interact with the home
   security system, providing the ability to arm and disarm our home
   remotely. Some complete home automation systems will alert us by phone,
   text or email if there is any unusual movements within our home. Cheaper
   rates of cameras and different accessible network technologies have made
   remote home monitoring more effective enabling us to control everything
   from our cell phone. In this paper, we present the design and
   implementation of a home security system to detect an intruder at home
   when nobody is present. This low-cost security system uses a small
   Pyroelectric Infrared (PIR) module and a Infrared (IR) sensor, and is
   built around ARM7 microcontroller. Presence of individual is detected
   when the system senses the signal generated by many sensors. The system
   sends a message to the user through GSM modem after detecting the
   presence of unauthorized person. The user then monitors the intrusion
   from anywhere, on an Internet enabled device by using IP address of the
   installed IP webcam of mobile in home, and alerts the neighbors and
   police. The user can also save the images and record the videos, which
   can be stored in a public cloud for later use. Preparatory experiments
   have shown encouraging results.},

Abstract = {This paper is meant to discuss the DNS security vulnerabilities and best
   practices to address DNS security challenges. The Domain Name System
   (DNS) is the foundation of internet which translates user friendly
   domains, named based Resource Records (RR) into corresponding IP
   addresses and vice-versa. Nowadays usage of DNS services are not merely
   for translating domain names, but it is also used to block spam, email
   authentication like DKIM and the latest DMARC, the TXT records found in
   DNS are mainly about improving the security of services. So, virtually
   almost every internet application is using DNS. If not works properly
   then whole internet communication will collapse. Therefore security of
   DNS infrastructures is one of the core requirements for any organization
   in current cyber security arena. DNS are favorite place for attackers
   due to huge loss of its outcome. So breach in DNS security will in
   resultant affects the trust worthiness of whole internet. Therefore
   security of DNS is paramount, in case DNS infrastructure is vulnerable
   and compromised, organizations lose their revenue, they face downtime,
   customer dissatisfaction, privacy loss, confront legal challenges and
   many more. As we know that DNS is now become the largest distributed
   database, but initially at the time of DNS design the only goal was to
   provide scalable and available name resolution service but its security
   perspectives were not focused and overlooked at that time. So there are
   number of security flaws exist and there is an urgent requirement to
   provide some additional mechanism for addressing known vulnerabilities.
   From these security challenges, most important one is DNS data integrity
   and availability. For this purpose we introduced cryptographic framework
   that is configured on open source platform by incorporating DNSSEC with
   Bind DNS software which addresses integrity and availability issues of
   DNS by establishing DNS chain of trust using digitally signed DNS data.},

Title = {An Advanced Deep Attention Collaborative Mechanism for Secure
   Educational Email Services},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {APR 26},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 crisis has once again highlighted the vulnerabilities of
   some critical areas in cyberspace, especially in the field of education,
   as distance learning and social distance have increased their dependence
   on digital technologies and connectivity. Many recent cyberattacks on
   e-learning systems, educational content services, and trainee management
   systems have created severe demands for specialized technological
   solutions to protect the security of modern training methods. Email is
   one of the most critical technologies of educational organizations that
   are attacked daily by spam, phishing campaigns, and all kinds of
   malicious programs. Considering the efforts made by the global research
   community to ensure educational processes, this study presents an
   advanced deep attention collaborative filter for secure academic email
   services. It is a specialized application of intelligent techniques
   that, for the first time, examines and models the problem of spam as a
   system of graphs where collaborative referral systems undertake the
   processing and analysis of direct and indirect social information to
   detect and categorize spam emails. In this study, nonnegative matrix
   factorization (NMF) is applied to the social graph adjacent table to
   place users in one (or more) overlapping communities. Also, using a deep
   attention mechanism, it becomes personalized for each user. At the same
   time, with the introduction of exponential random graph models (ERGMs)
   in the process of factorization, local dependencies are significantly
   mitigated to achieve the revelation of malicious communities. This
   methodology is being tested successfully in implementing mail protection
   systems for educational organizations. According to the findings, the
   proposed algorithm outperforms all other compared algorithms in every
   metric tested.},

Abstract = {Today sending spams has turned to be a major problem in the Internet. It
   is so serious that more than 80\% of the transferred emails are spams.
   As a result, various methods have been proposed for preventing spams.
   One of these methods in this field is CAPTCHA (Completely Automatic
   Public Turing Test to tell Computer and Humans Apart) method. They have
   been developed to prevent automatically made accounts in sites which
   offer free email accounts.
   In this paper a new protocol is presented for authentication of users
   which enable us to confirm that a user is a human using CAPTCHA method.
   By using this protocol for authentication of users, we can design secure
   mail servers in order to prevent zombie computers sending spams by our
   server. This protocol has been designed according to CRAM-MD5 protocol
   and has been implemented under the SASL (Simple Authentication and
   Security Layer). This protocol can be implemented easily and enjoys high
   flexibility and versatility.},

Abstract = {Following the principle of to set one's own spear against one's own
   shield, we study how to design adversarial completely automated public
   turing test to tell computers and humans apart (CAPTCHA) in this
   article. We first identify the similarity and difference between
   adversarial CAPTCHA generation and existing hot adversarial example
   (image) generation research. Then, we propose a framework for text-based
   and image-based adversarial CAPTCHA generation on top of
   state-of-the-art adversarial image generation techniques. Finally, we
   design and implement an adversarial CAPTCHA generation and evaluation
   system, called aCAPTCHA, which integrates 12 image preprocessing
   techniques, nine CAPTCHA attacks, four baseline adversarial CAPTCHA
   generation methods, and eight new adversarial CAPTCHA generation
   methods. To examine the performance of aCAPTCHA, extensive security and
   usability evaluations are conducted. The results demonstrate that the
   generated adversarial CAPTCHAs can significantly improve the security of
   normal CAPTCHAs while maintaining similar usability. To facilitate the
   CAPTCHA security research, we also open source the aCAPTCHA system,
   including the source code, trained models, datasets, and the usability
   evaluation interfaces.},

Abstract = {Cybercrime is all about the crimes involved with the environment where
   ever a network is involved and the steps implemented to control or
   overcome this cyber-security. The work culture of all the sectors are
   moving towards digitalization and cloud based systems in order to
   increase the work efficiency with more accuracy, In addition to this a
   majority of individuals are fond of using social networking sites and
   email servers in many ways directly or indirectly. Cybercrime is a type
   of crime where technical expertise is required not only to crack it but
   in order to make a user secure or to apply any preventive majors. In
   this paper we have described about the basics of this dreadful crime,
   recent research \& development in the field of cyber security, the types
   of crimes and a small survey with an IT company. Our aim with this
   research is to check the awareness level of cybercrime and security

   in such systems. These decisions are associated with risks that should
   be minimised through continued monitoring of user activities, network
   analysis, and implementation of innovative technologies. Risk management
   concerns the process of identifying and assessing risks. Organisational
   risk management calls for dedicated IT solutions capable of analysing,
   supporting an organisation's operations. This study focuses on issues
   relating to risks inherent in data protection alongside aspects of
   information system security exemplified by intrusion detection systems
   (IDS). The study seeks to explore the concept of personal data security
   using state-of-the-art solutions that have been developed in computer
   decision support. As a result, an algorithm for screening email messages
   from the angle of personal data protection is proposed, and a prototype
   software agent system is presented capable of supporting risk assessment
   based on system logs.},

Abstract = {In the realm of security, the perpetual pursuit of safeguarding
   invaluable possessions and critical documents has spurred continuous
   innovation. Modern organizations deploy an array of sensor and alarm
   systems, encompassing keys, facial recognition, and fingerprint
   authentication to fortify their security protocols. However, inherent
   limitations in these methods render them vulnerable to potential theft.
   This research presents a pioneering approach to overcome these
   constraints by introducing an advanced smart locker system engineered to
   significantly mitigate the risk of theft compared to the existing
   systems. The system seamlessly integrates essential components, such as
   Arduino, fingerprint sensors, micro-cameras, electronic door locks,
   keypads, LCD displays, and node MCU culminating in a robust defense
   mechanism. Three intricately designed protection layers harmonize to
   form a comprehensive security framework. The first layer, termed the
   ``shielding layer,{''} activates the micro-camera and fingerprint sensor
   to capture images of unauthorized tampering. These images are
   transmitted expeditiously to the email and phone of the administrator
   for immediate intervention. Subsequently, the ``identification layer{''}
   employs a sophisticated fingerprint sensor to authenticate registered
   users, further enhancing security. Finally, ``Internet of Things
   layer{''} generates a four-digit OTP dispatched to the mobile device of
   the user. Upon entering the correct OTP, users receive a secure link via
   email, thereby granting access to the locker. This synergistic
   integration of security layers transcends conventional systems, offering
   robust protection and intelligence within security paradigms. The
   proposed system, tested against several state-of-the-art secure locker
   systems, effectively addresses evolving challenges in safeguarding
   valuable possessions and documents providing enhanced security.},

Title = {General Knowledge and Attitudes about Safety and Emergency Evacuation:
   The Case of a Higher Education Institution},
Journal = {SAFETY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The implementation of a safety culture and awareness of emergency issues
   in buildings has been growing in more developed societies. It is
   essential that all occupants know how to act in an emergency situation,
   particularly during an emergency evacuation. In higher education
   institutions (HEIs), which annually host not only their many employees,
   but also national and international students, it is essential to know
   and understand the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors that the academic
   community demonstrates in this matter. This study aimed to characterize
   the perception of occupants regarding safety, specifically in the
   emergency evacuation phase, within the academic community of an HEI. In
   this observational cross-sectional study, data on general knowledge and
   attitudes regarding safety and actions during emergency situations were
   collected through an anonymous questionnaire targeting students,
   faculty, and non-teaching staff, which was sent via institutional email.
   Valid responses were received from 392 participants and then scored and
   assessed on different domains. The results obtained showed that, despite
   a reasonable average regarding the general level of knowledge,
   attitudes, and behaviors of the occupants on the subject, the community
   falls somewhat short in terms of training. It is noteworthy that
   approximately 64\% of the sample has never received awareness or
   training related to emergency evacuation, and around 68\% are unaware of
   the location of their institution's meeting/gathering point. Finally, by
   identifying the most common gaps, namely the training dimension, some
   simple measures could be improved, such as the dissemination of safety
   instructions accessible through QR codes placed in strategic locations
   or even conducting small drills during class sessions, as well as
   learning with simulation concerning different scenarios of emergency.},

Abstract = {Electronic mail has become the most popular, frequently-used and
   powerful medium for quicker personal and business communications.
   However, one of the common security issues and annoying problems faced
   by email users and organizations is receiving a large number of
   unsolicited email messages, known as spam emails, every day. A
   traditional countermeasure in most email systems nowadays is simple
   filtering mechanisms that can block or quarantine unwanted emails based
   on some keywords defined by the user. These filters require continual
   effort to keep them relevant and current with some extensions proposed
   to improve their performance. However, due to the gigantic volumes of
   received emails and the continual change in spamming techniques to
   bypass the implemented solutions, novel automated ideas and
   countermeasures need to be investigated. This paper explores a novel
   algorithm inspired by the immune system called dendritic cell algorithm
   (DCA). This algorithm is evaluated on a number of benchmark datasets to
   detect spam emails. The results demonstrate that this approach can be a
   promising solution for email classification and spam filtering.},

Title = {When believing in technology leads to poor cyber security: Development
   of a trust in technical controls scale},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {98},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {While technical controls can reduce vulnerabilities to cyber threats, no
   technology provides absolute protection and we hypothesised that people
   may act less securely if they place unwarranted trust in these automated
   systems. This paper describes the development of a Trust in Technical
   Controls Scale (TTCS) that measures people's faith in four of these
   technical controls. In an online study (N = 607), Australian employees
   demonstrated a greater degree of trust in firewalls and anti-virus
   software than they did in spam filters and social media privacy
   settings. Lower scores on the four item TTCS were related to better
   information security awareness (ISA) and higher scores on tests of
   cognitive abilities such as non-verbal IQ and cognitive reflection. The
   TTCS predicted an individual's ability to detect a phishing email to a
   similar degree as other factors such as ISA, non-verbal IQ and cognitive
   impulsivity. However, unlike ISA, the scale did not predict the strength
   of passwords people constructed. Results suggest that the TTCS is a
   useful complement to ISA in understanding and predicting certain cyber
   security behaviours. Crown Copyright (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Much electronic mail is sent unencrypted, making it vulnerable to
   passive eavesdropping. We propose to protect email privacy by building
   encryption functionality into ESMTP mailers. Our solution, ssmail,
   provides fast, simple encryption for sendmail that does not require user
   intervention or reliance on public key infrastructure. We added a small
   number of steps to an ESMTP session, thereby allowing a client and
   server to create a secret, one-time session key used to encrypt the mail
   transfer session, ssmail relies on caching to reduce key generation
   overhead. The overhead imposed by our encryption scheme is minimal,
   allowing even busy mail servers to support privacy.
   We placed our encryption mechanism within the mail transfer agent itself
   allowing people to use privacy protection software without having to
   know how to run an encryption program explicitly Furthermore, we are
   able to encrypt the email transmission session, protecting such
   information as sender and recipient identities. The speed and simplicity
   of ssmail make it a very useful addition to widely deployed ESMTP
   mailers. Our solution can also be adopted easily by other mailers, and
   can be extended to use other encryption algorithms.},

   academic library},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIANSHIP},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Library users have a wide variety of methods at their disposal for
   interacting virtually with libraries. This exploratory study examines
   user preferences with regard to virtual reference services and factors
   that account for these preferences from a different vantage point than
   previous literature by relying on semi-structured interviews with users.
   Using NVivo qualitative data analysis software, I coded interview
   transcripts and applied grounded theory to identify preferences from
   among email to the library, email to a liaison librarian, chat and
   texting. In terms of virtual reference methods currently offered by the
   library, participants indicated a general preference for chat,
   highlighting the importance of this service. However, participants were
   reluctant to use chat on mobile phones, their most used communication
   technology. Findings also show that relational aspects are major factors
   influencing participants' choice of communication. Specifically,
   participants expressed a preference for modes of communication that are
   personal, informal, perceived as safe and secure and conversational.
   Participants expressed reservations for texting due to ambiguity about
   response times, the perception of the method as being too personal and
   safety and security concerns. Participants were reluctant to use email
   in general due to response times and its level of formality, but valued
   email with their liaison librarian for its level of personalness and the
   level of expertise they felt that the liaison librarian could offer.
   Understanding these preferences and the factors that account for them is
   important because it can influence which virtual reference services
   librarians choose to offer. It can also help to determine how well
   virtual reference provision is currently meeting user needs and identify
   ways service delivery and promotion can be improved.},

   Perception},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {100540-100565},
Abstract = {Phishing attacks are still seen as a significant threat to cyber
   security, and large parts of the industry rely on anti-phishing
   simulations to minimize the risk imposed by such attacks. This study
   conducted a large-scale anti-phishing training with more than 31000
   participants and 144 different simulated phishing attacks to develop a
   data-driven model to classify how users would perceive a phishing
   simulation. Furthermore, we analyze the results of our large-scale
   anti-phishing training and give novel insights into users' click
   behavior. Analyzing our anti-phishing training data, we find out that
   66\% of users do not fall victim to credential-based phishing attacks
   even after being exposed to twelve weeks of phishing simulations. To
   further enhance the phishing awareness-training effectiveness, we
   developed a novel manifold learning-powered machine learning model that
   can predict how many people would fall for a phishing simulation using
   the several structural and state-of-the-art NLP features extracted from
   the emails. In this way, we present a systematic approach for the
   training implementers to estimate the average ``convincing power{''} of
   the emails prior to rolling out. Moreover, we revealed the top-most
   vital factors in the classification. In addition, our model presents
   significant benefits over traditional rule-based approaches in
   classifying the difficulty of phishing simulations. Our results clearly
   show that anti-phishing training should focus on the training of
   individual users rather than on large user groups. Additionally, we
   present a promising generic machine learning model for predicting
   phishing susceptibility.},

Abstract = {Rapid growth of Internet was only possible when document description
   languages (esp. HTML), exchange protocols (HTTP) and navigation tools
   such as Netscape's browser and Internet Explorer were available for mass
   usage. Basic Internet features (protocols, esp. TCP/IP, domain
   organisation and routing concepts), navigation tools and document
   description languages have been specified without observing relevant
   security requirements, esp. concerning confidentiality of sensitive
   processes and data. Moreover, essential safety aspects - availability,
   reliability, maintainability, functionality - have also been neglected.
   As security and safety are `'design-inherent'' features (i.e. they must
   be specified in design and enforced in implemented systems), later
   enhancements (such as IP v.6 including authentication and encryption,
   protocols such as S-HTTP, SSL or SET) can at best reduce risks, but they
   can NOT cure past design faults.
   Within this insecure and unsafe Internet environment, `'agent''
   technologies develop, which perform net-''work'' with usually small
   processes which interoperate at an assumed benefit of users. A multitude
   of agents applications has been discussed, including delegation of
   tasks, handling email, coordination of group work and scheduling, mobile
   knowledge robots, distributed searches and many others. Early examples
   of agent technologies (though not named as such) have been XEROXs worms
   (which materialized in several network experiements and attacks) and
   chain letters. Started either automatically or from a users desktop (or
   better: WebTop), agents work in hidden manners. Therefore, security and
   safety aspects as well as mechanisms to control agents must be carefully
   analysed from design to implementation and actual work.
   JAVA was announced in 1996, by Sun Microsystems (in a `'White Paper'')
   as 4G-language for Internet applications. It supports development and
   execution of small agents, called `'applets'' which are executed upon a
   specific software engine (conceptually similar to Niklaus Wirth's p-Code
   for Pascal).
   According to Sun's summary: Java is a simple, object-oriented,
   distributed, interpreted, robust, secure, architecture neutral,
   portable, high-performance, multi-threaded, and dynamic language.''
   The C++-like JAVA-language has several deliberate restrictions, which
   according to Sun shall guarantee applet security. Among such
   restrictions, access to files and Internet address space (URLs) is
   strictly prohibited, and memory management (including garbage
   collection) is automatic; user-manipulated pointers are not supported in
   JAVA. As manipulation of memory (e.g. via memory residence) and
   manipulation of files are regarded as essential means with which
   (traditional) viruses propagate, some experts and Sun assume that JAVA
   viruses are `'impossible''; in a counterposition, others (such as Bill
   Cheswick) have regarded JAVA as `'ideal virus writing language''.
   Besides language restrictions, JAVA offers more security features. A
   special class of services `'security.java'' supports encryption,
   authentication (digital signatures), secure key exchange and integrity
   mechanisms (checksumming). On this basis, applets may be authorized and
   authenticated. This provides a secure channel to the manufacturer which
   is `'secure'' if and when the manufacturer is regarded trustworthy. An
   additional feature is that JAVA applets are executed upon ist own
   interpreter; JAVA code can then be verified for conformance with
   security prescriptions (byte-code verifier).
   With these enhancements, JAVA is much better than almost all other
   language systems though it is inferior to Secure ADA which offers also
   formal methods for proof of specified features (this is not foreseen in
   JAVA which does not hide its medium-level origin: it is similar to
   C/C++). Nevertheless, JAVA applets are far from being `'secure''. First,
   any hidden manipulation within the scope of the language is possible; it
   is therefore no surprise that `'hostile applets'' have soon been
   demonstrated on Internet, ranging from rather `'innocent'' Noisy.Bear''
   which `'only'' consumes processor time and memory, to `'Killer-java''
   which installs multiple threads and kills some browsers. These applets
   can be classified as `'malicious trojan horses''; they do NOT replicate
   but may nevertheless harmfully affect user data and processes.More
   generally, `'security'' is a feature of a system whithin properly
   specified boundaries. When JAVA applets execute on insecure systems
   (ranging from hardware to operationg systems to browsers and file
   systems), insecure use is possible despite JAVA restrictions. So far,
   insecure interactions of JAVA applets with browsers (esp. Netscape's)
   have been discussed (Princeton University). So far, self-reproduction
   has not been demonstrated. Moreover, essential safety aspects -
   availability, reliability, maintainability, functionality - have also
   been neglected in JAVA design.
   Conclusion: though JAVA has some security features, applets enlarges the
   risk of agent technologies. Based on insecure systems such as operating
   systems and browsers, risks of JAVA applets for sensitive information is
   significant.},

Abstract = {Highly targeted spear phishing attacks are increasingly common, and have
   been implicated in many major security breeches. Email filtering systems
   are the first line of defense against such attacks. These filters are
   typically configured with uniform thresholds for deciding whether or not
   to allow a message to be delivered to a user. However, users have very
   significant differences in both their susceptibility to phishing attacks
   as well as their access to critical information and credentials that can
   cause damage. Recent work has considered setting personalized thresholds
   for individual users based on a Stackelberg game model. We consider two
   important extensions of the previous model. First, in our model user
   values can be substitutable, modeling cases where multiple users provide
   access to the same information or credential. Second, we consider
   attackers who make sequential attack plans based on the outcome of
   previous attacks. Our analysis starts from scenarios where there is only
   one credential and then extends to more general scenarios with multiple
   credentials. For single-credential scenarios, we demonstrate that the
   optimal defense strategy can be found by solving a binary combinatorial
   optimization problem called PEDS. For multiple-credential scenarios, we
   formulate it as a bilevel optimization problem for finding the optimal
   defense strategy and then reduce it to a single level optimization
   problem called PEMS using complementary slackness conditions.
   Experimental results show that both PEDS and PEMS lead to significant
   higher defender utilities than two existing benchmarks in different
   parameter settings. Also, both PEDS and PEMS are more robust than the
   existing benchmarks considering uncertainties.},

Abstract = {Currently, mobile devices are a reality that is already part of people's
   lifes, and these people use them to shop online, to make payments, to
   access social networks, to surf the Internet, to check email and so on.
   In this context, users with mobile devices, especially smartphones,
   generally access the Internet with unsafe settings and becomes
   vulnerable to malicious users. Based on this context, this paper
   proposes a solution to identify and report potential unsafe settings
   related to smartphones based on Android, and it was developed an
   application that checks the smartphone searching for unsafe user
   configurations based on a predefined list. This list is based on the
   CERT Engineering and Software (SEI) recommendations for mobile devices.
   An evaluation with several users between the ages of 10 and 60 years was
   made. The evaluation demonstrated that a considerable number of mobile
   devices currently have various security risks that could be mitigated
   through the use of the proposed solution.},

Abstract = {Backup authentication mechanisms help users who have forgotten their
   passwords regain access to their accounts-or at least try. The security
   and reliability of today's backup authentication mechanisms have
   significant room for improvement. We designed, built, and tested a new
   authentication system that employs social-authentication. The system
   employs trustees previously appointed by the account holder to verify
   the account holder's identity. We ran three experiments to determine
   whether the system could (1) reliably authenticate account holders, (2)
   resist email attacks that target trustees by impersonating account
   holders, and (3) resist phone-based attacks from individuals close to
   account holders. Results were encouraging: seventeen of the nineteen
   participants who made the effort to call trustees authenticated
   successfully. However, we also found that users must be reminded of who
   their trustees are. While email-based attacks were largely unsuccessful,
   stronger countermeasures will be required to counter highly-personalized
   phone-based attacks.},

   Various types of information security instruments in an institution
   cannot provide maximum protection as long as employees still have a low
   level of information security awareness. This study aims to measure the
   level of information security awareness of government employees through
   case studies at the Directorate General of ABC (DG ABC) in Indonesia.
   This study used two methods, behavior approach through phishing
   simulation and knowledge approach through a questionnaire on a Likert
   scale. The simulation results were analyzed on a percentage scale and
   compared to the results of the questionnaire to determine the level of
   employees' information security awareness and determine which method was
   the best. Results show a significant relationship between the simulation
   results and the questionnaire results. Among the employees who opened
   the email, 69\% clicked on the link that led to the camouflage page and
   through the questionnaire, it was found that the information security
   awareness level of DG ABC employees was at the level of 79.32\% which
   was the lower limit of the GOOD category.},

Abstract = {An electronic safety reporting (ESR) module was developed and integrated
   into a home-grown web-based clinical trial management system (CTMS) to
   enhance the efficiency, completeness and consistency of reporting and
   reviewing serious adverse events, monitoring safety, and submitting
   safety reports to regulatory authorities for a large multicenter
   clinical trial. The architecture of this integrated module provided many
   advantages. First, the ESR module was developed based on a comprehensive
   procedure which incorporated both computer logic processing steps and
   human intervention steps in order to deal with the complex and
   unexpected situations where pre-programmed computer logic may fail.
   Second, safety and efficacy data were managed within the same relational
   database. Relevant data captured on efficacy case report forms, such as
   demographics, medical history, lab data and concomitant medications,
   were directly retrievable for MedWatch report composition without
   requiring redundant data entry. Finally, the ESR module shared the same
   generic user interfaces and data processing functions with other modules
   in the CTMS. These generic components include data editing, data
   retrieving, data reporting, dictionary-based automatic and interactive
   coding, event-driven and calendar-driven automatic email notifications,
   and user privilege management. This integrated ESR module was
   implemented in the Albumin in Acute Stroke (ALIAS) Trial Part 1. A total
   of 397 serious adverse event reports were processed and 33 FDA MedWatch
   reports, 28 initial reports, and 5 follow-up reports were submitted to
   FDA and Health Canada using this system. Experiences and lessons learned
   from the development and implementation of this system are presented in
   this paper. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Networking attacks embedded in spam emails are increasingly becoming
   numerous and sophisticated in nature. Hence this has given a growing
   need for spam email analysis to identify these attacks. The use of these
   intrusion detection systems has given rise to other two issues, 1) the
   presentation and understanding of large amounts of spam emails, 2) the
   user-assisted input and quantified adjustment during the analysis
   process. In this paper we introduce a new analytical model that uses two
   coefficient vectors: `density' and `weight' for the analysis of spam
   email viruses and attacks. We then use a visual clustering method to
   classify and display the spam emails. The visualization allows users to
   interactively select and scale down the scope of views for better
   understanding of different types of the spam email attacks. The
   experiment shows that this new model with the clustering visualization
   can be effectively used for network security analysis.},

Title = {Managing information security awareness at an Australian bank: a
   comparative study},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND COMPUTER SECURITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {181-189},
Abstract = {Purpose - The aim of this study was first to confirm that a specific
   bank's employees were generally moreinformation security-aware than
   employees in other Australian industries and second to identify the
   major factors that contributed to this bank's high levels of information
   security awareness (ISA).
   Design/methodology/approach - A Web-based questionnaire (the Human
   Aspects of Information Security Questionnaire - HAIS-Q) was used in two
   separate studies to assess the ISA of individuals who used computers at
   their workplace. The first study assessed 198 employees at an Australian
   bank and the second study assessed 500 working Australians from various
   industries. Both studies used a Qualtrics-based questionnaire that was
   distributed via an email link.
   Findings - The results showed that the average level of ISA among bank
   employees was consistently 20 per cent higher than that among general
   workforce participants in all focus areas and overall. There were no
   significant differences between the ISA scores for those who received
   more frequent training compared to those who received less frequent
   training. This result suggests that the frequency of training is not a
   contributing factor to an employee's level of ISA.
   Research limitations/implications - This current research did not
   investigate the information security (InfoSec) culture that prevailed
   within the bank in question because the objective of the research was to
   compare a bank's employees with general workforce employees rather than
   compare organisations. The Research did not include questions relating
   to the type of training participants had received at work.
   Originality/value - This study provided the bank's InfoSec management
   with evidence that their multi-channelled InfoSec training regime was
   responsible for a substantially higher-than-average ISA for their
   employees. Future research of this nature should examine the
   effectiveness of various ISA programmes in light of individual
   differences and learning styles. This would form the basis of an
   adaptive control framework that would complement many of the current
   international standards, such as ISO's 27000 series, NIST's SP800 series
   and ISACA's COBIT5.},

Title = {Discovering ``Insider IT Sabotage{''} based on human behaviour},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND COMPUTER SECURITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {575-589},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {Purpose
   Malicious activities conducted by disgruntled employees via an email
   platform can cause profound damage to an organization such as financial
   and reputational losses. This threat is known as an ``Insider IT
   Sabotage{''} threat. This involves employees misusing their access
   rights to harm the organization. Events leading up to the attack are not
   technical but rather behavioural. The problem is that owing to the high
   volume and complexity of emails, the risk of insider IT sabotage cannot
   be diminished with rule-based approaches.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Malicious human behaviours that insiders within the insider IT sabotage
   category would possess are studied and mapped to phrases that would
   appear in email communications. A large email data set is classified
   according to behavioural characteristics of these employees. Machine
   learning algorithms are used to identify occurrences of this insider
   threat type. The accuracy of these approaches is measured.
   Findings
   It is shown in this paper that suspicious behaviour of disgruntled
   employees can be discovered, by means of machine intelligence
   techniques. The output of the machine learning classifier depends mainly
   on the depth and quality of the phrases and behaviour analysis,
   cleansing and number of email attributes examined. This process of
   labelling content in isolation could be improved if other attributes of
   the email data are included, such that a confidence score can be
   computed for each user.
   Originality/value
   This research presents a novel approach to show that the creation of a
   prototype that can automate the detection of insider IT sabotage within
   email systems to mitigate the risk within organizations.},

Abstract = {Ensuring operational integrity in the ever-evolving internet landscape
   requires robust cybersecurity measures to combat emerging security
   compromise vectors. Despite traditional techniques, insider threats pose
   a significant challenge, exploiting the human element and contributing
   to substantial cyberattack losses. On-premises attacks, facilitated by
   physical access, defy conventional detection methods, necessitating
   alternative approaches. This study explores the integration of natural
   language processing (NLP) with the AdaBoost classifier for identifying
   malicious intent in email content, utilizing publicly available datasets
   to detect insider threats. Optimizing model hyperparameters through
   various algorithms, including a modified elk herd optimization
   algorithm, enhances performance. The best-performing model is analyzed
   in-depth, uncovering key terms crucial for malicious intent detection
   and their roles in the classification process.},

Abstract = {Smartphones are more and more used by Internet users for different
   services such as social networks, e-commerce or email. User
   authentication with passwords on such devices is not user-friendly and
   does not offer a high security level for this task. Biometrics is
   becoming one popular solution to achieve this goal with the embedding of
   fingerprint scanners in smartphones. In this paper, we propose a new
   protocol combining fingerprint and behavioral biometrics to enhance the
   security of user authentication while preserving usability and privacy.
   The behavior when entering a pattern based authentication on the
   smartphone touch screen is considered as a fast and usable solution for
   users. We think the proposed multi-biometric solution offers great
   advantages for many applications such as e-payment in terms of security,
   usability and privacy. We show through experimental results the
   efficiency of the proposed method.},

Abstract = {The attack landscape is evolving, and attackers are employing new
   techniques to launch increasingly targeted and sophisticated social
   engineering attacks that exploit human vulnerabilities. Many
   organizations provide their employees with security awareness training
   to counter and mitigate such threats. However, recent studies have shown
   that current embedded phishing training programs and tools are often
   ineffective or incapable of addressing modern, tailored social
   engineering attacks. This paper presents a toolkit for the deployment of
   sophisticated, tailored phishing campaigns at scale (e.g., to deploy
   specific training within an organization). We enable the use of highly
   customizable phishing email templates that can be instantiated with a
   large range of information about the specific target and a
   semi-automated process for the selection of the phishing domain name. We
   demonstrate our tool by showing how tailored phishing campaigns proposed
   in previous studies can be enhanced to increase the credibility of the
   phishing email, effectively addressing the very limitations identified
   in those studies.},

Title = {The Capacity Region of Distributed Multi-User Secret Sharing Under
   Perfect Secrecy},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {9954-9969},
Abstract = {We study the problem of distributed multi-user secret sharing (DMUSS),
   involving a main node, N storage nodes, and K users. Every user has
   access to the contents of a certain subset of storage nodes and wants to
   decode an independent secret message. With knowledge of K secret
   messages, the main node strategically places encoded shares in the
   storage nodes, ensuring two crucial conditions: (i) each user can
   recover its own secret message from the storage nodes that it has access
   to; (ii) each user is unable to acquire any information regarding the
   collection of \$K-1\$ secret messages for all the other users. The rate
   of each user is defined as the size of its secret message normalized by
   the size of a storage node. We characterize the capacity region of the
   DMUSS problem, which is the closure of the set of all achievable rate
   tuples that satisfy the correctness and perfect secrecy conditions. The
   converse proof relies on a bound from the traditional single-secret
   sharing regime. In the achievability proof, we firstly design the linear
   decoding functions, based on the fact that each secret message needs to
   be recovered from a single set of storage nodes. It turns out that the
   perfect secrecy condition holds if K matrices, whose entries are
   extracted from the decoding functions, are full rank. We prove that the
   decoding functions can be constructed explicitly if the rate tuple
   satisfies the converse and the field size is not less than K. At last,
   the encoding functions are obtained by solving the system of linear
   decoding functions, where some shares are equal to the randomness and
   the other shares are linear combinations of the secret messages and the
   randomness.},

Abstract = {Systems with distributed trust have attracted growing research attention
   and seen increasing industry adoptions. In these systems, critical
   secrets are distributed across N servers, and computations are performed
   privately using secure multi-party computation (SMPC). Authentication
   for these distributed-trust systems faces two challenges. The first
   challenge is ease-of-use. Namely, how can an authentication protocol
   maintain its user experience without sacrificing security? To avoid a
   central point of attack, a client needs to authenticate to each server
   separately. However, this would require the client to authenticate N
   times for each authentication factor, which greatly hampers usability.
   The second challenge is privacy, as the client's sensitive profiles are
   now exposed to all N servers under different trust domains, which
   creates N times the attack surface for the profile data. We present
   MPCAuth, a multi-factor authentication system for distributed-trust
   applications that address both challenges. Our system enables a client
   to authenticate to N servers independently with the work of only one
   authentication. In addition, our system is profile hiding, meaning that
   the client's authentication profiles such as her email username, phone
   number, passwords, and biometric features are not revealed unless all
   servers are compromised. We propose secure and practical protocols for
   an array of widely adopted authentication factors, including email
   passcodes, SMS messages, U2F, security questions/passwords, and
   biometrics. Our system finds practical applications in the space of
   cryptocurrency custody and collaborative machine learning, and benefits
   future adoptions of distributed-trust applications.},

Abstract = {End-to-end encrypted email can help users prevent unauthorized access of
   their sensitive information. However, many users struggle to utilize
   encryption tools due to usability issues and low understanding. Thus, we
   designed video messaging interventions to persuade users to use email
   encryption software (Virtru). Our first intervention combined Protection
   Motivation Theory with Anticipated Regret (PMT+AR), and was designed to
   help participants understand the benefits of using encrypted email. Our
   second intervention also included Action Planning (PMT+AR+AP), and was
   designed to help participants recognize opportunities to use encrypted
   email. We conducted online interviews with 121 participants and used a
   follow-up survey to evaluate our interventions. Pre-intervention,
   participants believed that Gmail encrypted standard email content by
   default. Post-intervention, both messages made participants more likely
   to utilize encrypted email in a simulated information sharing scenario
   compared to Control. Our results suggest that our interventions can help
   people adopt protective technologies and address their misconceptions
   about them.},

Abstract = {Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSN) has gained increasing attention in
   health monitoring and service sector for real-time health monitoring and
   providing high-quality service. 6G wireless communication technologies
   overcome the limitations of the current 5G technology. An intelligent
   security system that prevents DDoS attack by applying solutions based on
   artificial intelligent is proposed. This method is used to identify the
   attackers in a heterogeneous environment by applying swarm
   intelligent-based Meta heuristic artificial intelligent algorithm called
   grey wolf optimization (GWO). The improved GWO algorithm fine tunes user
   categorization based on the service request from the WBSN devices. This
   approach includes KD tree (KDT) neighbor search algorithm to find the
   exact DDoS-attacked user electronic device by applying vertical and
   horizontal group division policy. The proposed method is evaluated with
   unsupervised dataset comprising 560 service requests, which include
   normal, anomaly and abnormal requests in proportions of 65\%, 25\% and
   10\%, respectively. The evaluation results show that the precision,
   recall, F1 Score and accuracy parameters were 92.3\%, 95.2\%, 93.7\% and
   91.5\%, respectively for the predicting the abnormal electronic devices.
   Statistical analysis shows that the mean absolute error value is smaller
   than the other variants of GWO algorithms.},

Abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) provides the opportunity for remote sensing in
   a smart home. This can benefit home security. A case study was devised
   to remotely sense, inform and actuate. The study developed a
   surveillance system using Raspberry Pi and camera to detect and
   recognize a door caller's face from a live video stream and compare with
   an existing dataset to verify whether the person was authorized. If not
   authorized, the remote homeowner can be alerted via an email complete
   with an image of the caller. Automated and user actions can be performed
   depending on the type of visitor. RaspController, Google Assistant and
   VNC were used for actuation, to perform actions like playing random
   music, triggering voice conversations or turning on an alarm. The
   recognition system was developed in Python using OpenCV and face
   recognition, using pre trained models for Hog detection and Haar Cascade
   classification. The accuracy of the detection was 66.7\% for a small
   cohort of seven authorized people and an unauthorized class of five
   people. For actuation, interoperability with many smart home devices can
   be controlled from the smart home network, but with only limited
   functionality from a remote network.},

Abstract = {Over the last years, most websites on which users can register (e.g.,
   email providers and social networks) adopted CAPTCHAs (Completely
   Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) as a
   countermeasure against automated attacks. The battle of wits between
   designers and attackers of captchas led to current ones being annoying
   and hard to solve for users, while still being vulnerable to automated
   attacks.
   In this paper, we propose CAPTCHaStar, a new image-based captcha that
   relies on user interaction. This novel captcha leverages the innate
   human ability to recognize shapes in a confused environment. We assess
   the effectiveness of our proposal for the two key aspects of captchas,
   i.e., usability, and resiliency to automated attacks. In particular, we
   evaluated the usability, carrying out a thorough user study, and we
   tested the resiliency of our proposal against several types of automated
   attacks: traditional ones; designed ad-hoc for our proposal; and based
   on machine learning. Compared to the state of the art, our proposal is
   more user friendly (e.g., only some 35\% of the users prefer current
   solutions, such as text-based captchas) and more resilient to automated
   attacks.},

Abstract = {In the realm of public-key encryption, the confidentiality notion of
   security against selective opening (SO) attacks considers adversaries
   that obtain challenge ciphertexts and are allowed to adaptively open
   them, meaning have the corresponding message and randomness revealed. SO
   security is stronger than IND-CCA and often required when formally
   arguing towards the security of multi-user applications. While different
   ways of achieving SO secure schemes are known, as they generally employ
   expensive asymmetric building blocks like lossy trapdoor functions or
   lossy encryption, such constructions are routinely left aside by
   practitioners and standardization bodies. So far, formal arguments
   towards the SO security of schemes used in practice (e.g., for email
   encryption) are not known.
   In this work we shift the focus from the asymmetric to the symmetric
   building blocks of PKE and prove the following statement: If a PKE
   scheme is composed of a key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) and a
   blockcipher-based data encapsulation mechanism (DEM), and the DEM has
   specific combinatorial properties, then the PKE scheme offers SO
   security in the ideal cipher model. Fortunately, as we show, the
   required properties hold for popular modes of operation like CTR, CBC
   and CCM. This paper not only establishes the corresponding theoretical
   framework of analysis, but also contributes very concretely to practical
   cryptography by concluding that selective opening security is given for
   many real-world},

Abstract = {Privacy is a core human need, but society sometimes has the requirement
   to do targeted, proportionate investigations in order to provide
   security. To reconcile individual privacy and societal security, we
   explore whether we can have surveillance in a form that is verifiably
   accountable to citizens. This means that citizens get verifiable proofs
   of the quantity and nature of the surveillance that actually takes
   place. In our scheme, governments are held accountable for the extent to
   which they exercise their surveillance power, and political parties can
   pledge in election campaigns their intention about reducing (or
   increasing) this figure.
   We propose a general idea of accountable escrow to reconciling and
   balancing the requirements of individual privacy and societal security.
   We design a balanced crypto system for asynchronous communication (e.g.,
   email). We propose a novel method for escrowing the decryption
   capability in public-key cryptography. A government can decrypt it in
   order to conduct targeted surveillance, but doing so necessarily puts
   records in a public log against which the government is held
   accountable.},

Abstract = {The role of the human in cyber security is well acknowledged. Many cyber
   security incidents rely upon targets performing specific behavioural
   actions, such as opening a link within a phishing email. Cyber
   adversaries themselves are driven by psychological processes such as
   motivation, group dynamics and social identity. Furthermore, both
   intentional and unintentional insider threats are associated with a
   range of psychological factors, including cognitive load, mental
   wellbeing, trust and interpersonal relations. By incorporating
   psychology into cyber security education, practitioners will be better
   equipped with the skills they need to address cyber security issues.
   However, there are challenges in doing so. Psychology is a broad
   discipline, andmany theories, approaches andmethods may have little
   practical significance to cyber security. There is a need to sift
   through the literature to identify what can be applied to cyber
   security. There are also pedagogical differences in how psychology and
   cyber security are taught and also psychological differences in the
   types of student that may typically study psychology and cyber security.
   To engage with cyber security students, it is important that these
   differences are identified and positively addressed. Essential to this
   endeavor is the need to discuss and collaborate across the two
   disciplines. In this paper, we explore these issues and discuss our
   experiences as psychology and cyber security academics who work across
   disciplines to deliver psychology education to cyber security students,
   practitioners and commercial clients.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a set of statistical analyses on an empirical study
   of phishing email sorting by real online users. Participants were
   assigned to multitasking and/or incentive conditions in unattended
   web-based tasks that are the most realistic in any comparable study to
   date. Our three stages of analyses included logistic regression models
   to identify individual phishing ``cues{''} contributing to successful
   classifications, statistical significance tests assessing the links
   between participants' training experience and self-assessments of
   success to their actual performance, significance tests searching for
   significant demographic factors influencing task completion performance,
   and lastly k-means clustering based on a range of performance measures
   and utilizing participants' demographic attributes. In particular, the
   results indicate that multitasking and incentives create complex
   dynamics while demographic traits and cybersecurity training can be
   informative predictors of user security behavior. These findings
   strongly support the benefits of security training and education and
   advocate for customized and differentiated interventions to increase
   users' success of correctly identifying phishing emails.},

Abstract = {This study draws from personality psychology and linguistics of written
   communication to explore the characteristics of self-selected
   well-written email communications (N=273) solicited from Polish managers
   who organized and supervised the (remote) work of their units during the
   COVID-19 period. The focus is on the writing of managers with
   above-average levels of conscientiousness and agreeableness, as these
   personality factors are predictors of efficacy in the completion of two
   work-related goals, Achievement and Communion, according to the Theory
   of Purposeful Work Behavior. The linguistic patterns responsible for
   effective email communication are identified through both automated and
   qualitative textual analyses of the email sample. The study has
   implications for management training via the assumption that linguistic
   patterns that a reflexive manager uses in writing are subjected to
   monitoring and can be modeled and adapted to. Specific recommendations
   for managerial writing styles concern informational, instructional,
   explanatory, feedback, and query messages.},

Abstract = {Internet users typically have several online accounts such as mail
   accounts, cloud storage accounts, or social media accounts. The security
   of these accounts is often intricately linked: The password of one
   account can be reset by sending an email to another account; the data of
   one account can be backed up on another account; one account can only be
   accessed by two-factor authentication through a second account; and so
   forth. This poses three challenges: First, if a user loses one or
   several of his passwords, can he still access his data? Second, how many
   passwords does an attacker need in order to access the data? And
   finally, how many passwords does an attacker need in order to
   irreversibly delete the user's data? In this paper, we model the
   dependencies of online accounts in order to help the user discover
   security weaknesses. We have implemented our system and invite users to
   try it out on their real accounts.},

Abstract = {Surfing Shoulder Surfing is a secret phrase-based attack which is a
   serious worry of protection in data security. Alphanumeric passwords are
   more helpless to attacks like shoulder surfing, dictionary attacks,
   etc., than graphical passwords. The creation of more muddled,
   challenging to-break passwords can be made simpler for clients with
   graphical authentication by consolidating the visuals and memory-based
   strategies like recall and recognition. In an imaged-based password, the
   user can choose pixels from the image to use as a secret key in the
   grid-based strategy, the user-selected image would show up on the screen
   with a framework overlay on it, and the client can pick explicit
   lattices to set their secret phrase. Besides, graphical passwords are
   powerless against shoulder surfing attacks, and due to this, clients are
   given a one-time made password via email. We investigated the
   limitations of image-based and grid-based authentication techniques and
   propose a grid-based graphical authentication system that addresses the
   limitations of image-based and grid-based techniques. The results of the
   grid-based graphical technique, as well as the image-based and
   grid-based approaches, have likewise been differentiated and analyzed.
   The convenience objective of our authentication system is to assist
   users in making better password selections, hence boosting security and
   broadening the usable password field. This method can be employed in
   many different contexts, such as forensic labs, banking, military, and
   other scenarios.},

Abstract = {Phishing is a form of attacks that conduct by tricking the users to be
   as legitimate entity or user. With a huge usage of electronic mail,
   email phishing attacks become the common type of electronic phishing. As
   a result, the organizations become an attractive target to the attackers
   in order to steal the organization's sensitive information or to do
   malicious actions. From this point, the anti-phishing awareness and
   training is considered as a persistent need. In this paper, the
   researchers focus on the electronic mail phishing that target
   governmental and private organizations in Riyadh. The researchers
   evaluate the current security training and awareness of employees in
   Riyadh through a survey. This paper discusses the result of measuring
   the electronic mail phishing awareness of the governmental and private
   organization in Riyadh. Besides that, it also measures the awareness of
   the governmental and private organizations about the importance of
   training and awareness against electronic mail phishing. However, there
   does appear to the effective awareness training in the governmental
   organizations more than the private one.},

Abstract = {Links in messages can imply a significant security risk because they may
   contain malware or phishing attempts. In contrast to computer science,
   phishing has rarely been studied in sociology. Using afield experiment
   (n = 1255) and a standardized online survey (n = 716), reactions of
   people who received a Facebook or email message with a link from
   anon-existing person were empirically compared using multiple logistic
   regressions. Further, the frame selection model was used to propose a
   first theoretical sociological approach.
   The results showed that, for emails, 20\% of recipients responded to
   phishing messages while, for Facebook, the percentage more than doubled,
   with 42\%. In general, curious readers clicked on the link more often.
   Contrary to the assumptions of the theoretical model, people who pay
   more attention to the message are more likely to click on the link. In
   accordance with the theoretical model, knowledge about possible dangers
   via email attachments paired with high attention lead to non-clicking.},

   integrate with online APIs, we performed a multi-part online survey of
   Google users. First, we asked n = 432 participants to recall if and when
   they allowed third-party access to their Google account: 89\% recalled
   using at least one SSO and 52\% remembered at least one third-party app.
   In the second survey, we re-recruited n = 214 participants to ask about
   specific apps and SSOs they've authorized on their own Google accounts.
   We collected in-the-wild data about users' actual SSOs and authorized
   apps: 86\% used Google SSO on at least one service, and 67\% had at
   least one third-party app authorized. After examining their apps and
   SSOs, participants expressed the most concern about access to personal
   information like email addresses and other publicly shared info.
   However, participants were less concerned with broader-and perhaps more
   invasive-access to calendars, emails, or cloud storage (as needed by
   third-party apps). This discrepancy may be due in part to trust
   transference to apps that integrate with Google, forming an implied
   partnership. Our results suggest opportunities for design improvements
   to the current third-party management tools offered by Google; for
   example, tracking recent access, automatically revoking access due to
   app disuse, and providing permission controls.},

Abstract = {At present, to access to email account or bank account, a network user
   has to remember the registered account number of the user and the
   corresponding password for every service with which they are registered.
   However, when multiple systems are involved, the user is then required
   to authenticate to each system individually and repeatedly. It results
   in inconvenience to each authentication. Recently, to overcome the
   problem, an identity-based single-sign-on scheme was proposed to achieve
   user identification and authentication to multiple security-protected
   systems simultaneously through a single operation. The security of the
   scheme is claimed to be related to the well-Known RSA cryptosystem and
   the discrete logarithm problem. Unfortunately, in this work we show that
   Ren's scheme is suffering an unforgeable attack, namely, any one can
   pass verification in name of any user's identity. Finally, an improved
   version is proposed.},

Abstract = {Keys are the essential elements needed in cryptography systems. Both
   hardware and software solutions are known to produce cryptographic keys.
   This paper reports a fast software-based approach to generate a private
   key. The proposed method considers three question-answer pairs decided
   by the user and email-Id, which is unique for a particular user, as the
   input. In the first step, a seed is generated, combining a triplet and a
   unique parameter. Triplet is constructed by representing question-answer
   pairs as three distinct points and using a harmonic set construction
   concept. A unique parameter is defined using the triangle formed with
   this construction and the user's email-Id. In the next step, taking seed
   as input, a unique key is generated with the help of cyclic
   idiosyncratic architecture. This private key generation concept is
   tested for correctness, randomness, dissimilarity, information entropy,
   reliability, and resilience against several security threats.},

Abstract = {With the proliferation of vehicular networking and data in the era of
   Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs), ensuring privacy-preserving
   authentication and data privacy during analysis has emerged as a pivotal
   research focus. In this article, we propose a blockchain-assisted
   privacy-preserving authentication protocol Bap with user-controlled data
   unlinkability for VANETs. We leverage Pointcheval-Sanders (PS)
   signatures to design a privacy-preserving authentication protocol that
   supports user traceability and revocation of malicious users.
   Additionally, we introduce an auxiliary data processor (DP) in our model
   to analyze VANET data with explicit and implicit linkability. The DP is
   capable of linking messages on the same or different topics, enabling
   minimal privacy disclosure during Big Data analysis. We provide a
   detailed proof and demonstrate that our scheme satisfies the required
   properties. Finally, performance evaluations demonstrate the efficiency
   of our proposed scheme. While supporting the mentioned functionalities,
   the gas cost is limited to a small range, and the signature size is only
   354 bytes.},

   ISL is developing a Security Event Management System which takes care of
   all security related events in the intermodal chain. The security system
   registers the schedule and transport information of a container and
   assigns a corridor for its transport.
   During the transport the system receives events which will be used for
   computing a security risk factor for each container, by considering
   restrictions like position with respect to the assigned corridor,
   duration of standstill and others. According to the value of the
   security risk factor the user will, be informed using web services, EDI

Abstract = {Recently, social networks such as Facebook have experienced a huge surge
   in popularity. The amount of personal information stored on these sites
   calls for appropriate security precautions to protect this data.
   In this paper, we describe how we are able to take advantage of a common
   weakness, namely the fact that an attacker can query popular social
   networks for registered e-mail addresses on a large scale. Starting with
   a list of about 10.4 million email addresses, we were able to
   automatically identify more than 1.2 million user profiles associated
   with these addresses. By automatically crawling and correlating these
   profiles, we collect detailed personal information about each user,
   which we use for automated profiling (i.e., to enrich the information
   available from each user). Having access to such information would allow
   an attacker to launch sophisticated, targeted attacks, or to improve the
   efficiency of spam campaigns. We have contacted the most popular
   providers, who acknowledged the threat and are currently implementing
   our proposed countermeasures. Facebook and XING, in particular, have
   recently fixed the problem.},

Abstract = {Use-after-free is a type of vulnerability commonly present in software
   written in memory-unsafe languages like C or C++, where a program frees
   a memory buffer too early. By placing counterfeit structures at the
   freed memory location, an attacker can leak information or gain
   execution control upon subsequent access.
   In this paper, we show that the concept of use-after-free can be
   generalized to any environment and situation where resources can be
   silently exchanged. As an instance of our generalization we demonstrate
   Use-After-FreeMail attacks. Use-After-FreeMail attacks gather email
   addresses from publicly available database leaks. The fully automated
   quantitative analysis brought to light that 33.5\% of all free-mail
   addresses we tested are not valid anymore. In two user studies with 100
   and 31 participants we found that 11-19\% of users are affected by our
   attack. In qualitative case studies we investigated what information can
   be gained in Use-After-FreeMail attacks, e.g., payment information, and
   how far currently used accounts can be compromised (identity theft).
   Finally, drawing the connection between mitigations against traditional
   use-afterfree scenarios and the Use-After-FreeMail scenario, we provide
   a concise list of recommendations to free-mail providers and users as a
   protection against use-after-free attacks.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to explore the mediating effects of role
   overload and job security on the relationship between leader-member
   exchange and work engagement and simultaneously examines the impact of
   role overload on employees' job security.
   Design/methodology/approach By means of telephone and email, the study
   inquired eight international tourist hotels' willingness, and
   questionnaires were distributed to employees of these hotels in 2014.
   The hotel employees were asked to participate, and they have the right
   to agree or not. After discarding unusable responses, 310 individual
   surveys ratings were collected from a total of 500 self-administrated
   questionnaires were distributed (a 62.0 per cent response rate).
   Findings The result indicates that role overload and job security have
   mediating effects on the relationship between leader-member exchange and
   work engagement. Also, role overload can positively influence job
   security.
   Originality/value To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
   to examine the mediating roles of role overload and job security between
   LMX and work engagement, as well as the influence of role overload on
   job security. This study attempts to make contributions to human
   resource management literatures of hospitality and tourism.},

Abstract = {Most of today's applications require an Internet connection to reach
   cloud servers essential for their functioning. However, in many
   scenarios, such connectivity is unavailable, such as when a user is in a
   remote location with no cellular coverage or during a natural disaster.
   In these situations, nearby devices can still connect to each other, and
   the applications running on each device can have data useful to each
   other; however, the applications are unable to exchange data directly
   between themselves.
   In this paper, we describe mechanisms to enable off-the-grid
   communication for existing applications, allowing them to directly
   exchange data between themselves. To achieve this goal, an application
   should be capable of discovering, fetching, and verifying data without
   the help of a server. We believe that Named Data Networking (NDN) can
   provide an application with these abilities. We utilize email access as
   a study case and propose mailSync, a framework to the goal of app-to-app
   communication for this application via NDN. Meanwhile, we identify the
   various differences between TCP/IP and NDN applications, and we
   generalize several steps to ``NDNize{''} an existing application,
   including protocol translation, application layer framing, naming, data
   discovery and security management. We implemented a prototype of
   mailSync in Java on laptop and Android as a proof of concept.},

Abstract = {Phishing attacks are one of the most common security challenges faced by
   individuals and organizations today. Although many techniques exist to
   filter out phishing emails, they are not always effective leaving humans
   as the most vulnerable links in the information security chain. This
   paper presents a study investigating how human behavior, especially
   mouse movements, may reflect cybersecurity awareness, in particular to
   phishing emails. Using an email sorting task, we examined three key
   mouse movement features: hover, slow movement, and response time. The
   results suggest that slow mouse movements indicate high awareness of
   phishing emails and could be used to determine the likelihood of users
   falling victim to phishing attacks. However, contrary to intuition,
   response time and mouse hovering behaviors do not correlate with
   phishing awareness.},

Abstract = {Smartphones provide anytime-anywhere communications and are being
   increasingly used for a variety of purposes, e. g, sending email,
   performing online transactions, connecting with friends and
   acquaintances over social networks. As a result, a considerable amount
   of sensitive personal information is often generated and stored on
   smartphones. Thus, smartphone users may face financial as well as
   sentimental consequences if such information fall in the wrong hands. To
   address this problem all smartphones provide some form of user
   authentication, that is the process of verifying the user's identity.
   Existing authentication mechanisms, such as using 4-digit passcodes or
   graphical patterns, suffer from multiple limitations -they are neither
   highly secure nor easy to input. As a results, recent studies found that
   most smartphone's users do not use any authentication mechanism at all.
   In this paper, we present a fully unobtrusive user authentication scheme
   based on micromovements of the user's hand(s) after the user unlocks her
   smartphone. The proposed scheme collects data from multiple 3
   -dimensional smartphone sensors in the background for a specific period
   of time and profiles a user based on the collected hand(s) movement
   patterns. Subsequently, the system matches the query pattern with the
   pre-stored patterns to authenticate the smartphone owner. Our system
   achieved a True Acceptance Rate (TAR) of 9 6 \% at an Equal Error Rate
   (EER) of 4 \%, on a dataset of 3 1 qualified volunteers (5 3, in total),
   using Random Forest (RF) classifier. Our scheme can be used as a primary
   authentication mechanism or can be used as a secondary authentication
   scheme in conjunction with any of the existing authentication schemes,
   e. g., passcodes, to improve their security.},

Abstract = {OpenPGP and S/MIME are the two major standards to encrypt and digitally
   sign emails. Digital signatures are supposed to guarantee authenticity
   and integrity of messages. In this work we show practical forgery
   attacks against various implementations of OpenPGP and S/MIME email
   signature verification in five attack classes: (1) We analyze edge cases
   in S/MIME's container format. (2) We exploit in-band signaling in the
   GnuPG API, the most widely used OpenPGP implementation. (3) We apply
   MIME wrapping attacks that abuse the email clients' handling of
   partially signed messages. (4) We analyze weaknesses in the binding of
   signed messages to the sender identity. (5) We systematically test email
   clients for UI redressing attacks.
   Our attacks allow the spoofing of digital signatures for arbitrary
   messages in 14 out of 20 tested OpenPGP-capable email clients and 15 out
   of 22 email clients supporting S/MIME signatures. While the attacks do
   not target the underlying cryptographic primitives of digital
   signatures, they raise concerns about the actual security of OpenPGP and
   S/MIME email applications. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies to
   counter these attacks.},

   faculty, and staff on campus were targeted by 90,000 phishing emails.
   Throughout these experiments, we explored the effectiveness of three
   types of phishing awareness training. Our results show that phishing
   emails that make it through IT's defenses pose a clear and present
   threat to large educational organizations. Moreover, we found that
   simple, visual, instructional guides are more effective training tools
   than long documents or interactive training.},

Abstract = {Recently, Google revealed that it has replaced the 10-year old MapReduce
   with its new systems (e.g., DataFlow) which can provide better
   performances and support more sophisticated applications.
   Simultaneously, other new systems, such as Spark, Impala and epiC, are
   also being developed to handle new requirements for big data processing.
   The fact shows that since their emergence, big data techniques are
   changing very fast. In this paper, we use our experience in developing
   and maintaining the information security system for Netease as an
   example to illustrate how those big data systems evolve. In particular,
   our first version is a Hadoop-based offline detection system, which is
   soon replaced by a more flexible online streaming system. Our ongoing
   work is to build a generic real-time analytic system for Netease to
   handle various jobs such as email spam detection, user pattern mining,
   game log analysis, etc. The example shows how the requirements of users
   (e.g., Netease and its clients) affect the design of big data system and
   drive the advance of technologies. Based on our experience, we also
   propose some key design factors and challenges for future big data
   systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   ability to selectively enroll users and fall-back to traditional methods
   if needed. The scheme utilizes the ubiquity of smartphones; however,
   unlike previous proposals it does not require registration or
   connectivity of the phones used. In addition, no long-term secrets are
   stored in any user's phone, mitigating the consequences of losing it.
   Our design significantly increases the difficulty of launching a
   phishing attack by automating the decisions of whether a website should
   be trusted and introducing additional risk at the adversary side of
   being detected and deceived. In addition, the scheme is resilient
   against Man-in-the-Browser (MitB) attacks and compromised client
   machines. We also introduce a covert communication mechanism between the
   user's client and the service provider. This can be used to covertly and
   securely communicate the user's context that comes with the use of this
   mechanism. The scheme also incorporates the use of deception that makes
   it possible to dismantle a large-scale attack infrastructure before it
   succeeds. As an added feature, the scheme gives service providers the
   ability to have full-transaction authentication.
   With the use of our scheme, passwords are no longer communicated in
   plaintext format to the server, adding another layer of protection when
   secure channels of communication are compromised. Moreover, it gives
   service providers the ability to deploy risk-based authentication. It
   introduces the ability to make dynamic multi-level access decisions
   requiring extra authentication steps when needed. Finally, the scheme's
   covert channel mechanisms give servers the ability to utilize a user's
   context information - detecting the use of untrusted networks or whether
   the login was based on a solicitation email.},

Abstract = {Asynchronous information exchange with email is inexpensive, easily and
   quickly to set up in the case of workflow treatment in the tax declaring
   and suitable for huge users to declare tax in the short time. This paper
   proposed an asynchronous information exchange and workflow management
   systems based on XML embedded email for tax declaring. The XML data
   sheet is used to exchange the tax declaring data by email between the
   taxpayer and the special tax management information system in the
   revenue department. The workflow of the system is consisted of the
   client and the server side. In the client side, the tax declaring data
   is inputted into the XML data sheet with XML editors and delivered to
   the mail server in the revenue department by STMP protocol. In the
   server side, the XML based tax declaring data sheet is received from the
   mail server by POP3 protocol and transformed to the data items that can
   be recognized by the tax management information system. The system could
   offer a new tax declaring service for the revenue department with
   security, reliability, high speed, and suitable for large-scale
   taxpayers to declares taxes asynchronously with low cost, extensive
   information treatment and data exchange. The proposed system could be
   widely applied in the tax declaring to the revenue department for public
   taxpayers.},

Abstract = {Older adults are rapidly increasing their use of online services such as
   banking, social media, and email - services that come with subtle and
   serious security and privacy risks. Older adults with mild cognitive
   impairment (MCI) are particularly vulnerable to these risks because MCI
   can reduce their ability to recognize scams such as email phishing,
   follow recommended password guidelines, and consider the implications of
   sharing personal information. Older adults with MCI often cope with
   their impairments with the help of caregivers, including partners,
   children, and professional health personnel, when using and managing
   online services. Yet, this too carries security and privacy risks:
   sharing personal information with caregivers can create issues of
   agency, autonomy, and even risk embarrassment and information leakage;
   caregivers also do not always act in their charges' best interest.
   Through a series of interviews conducted in the US, we identify a
   spectrum of safeguarding strategies used and consider them through the
   lens of `upside and downside risk' where there are tradeoffs between
   reduced privacy and maintaining older adults' autonomy and access to
   online services.},

Title = {ERACMA: Expressive and Revocable Access Control With Multi-Authority for
   AIoT-Enabled Human Centric Consumer Electronics},

Abstract = {With the maturation of Artificial Intelligence empowered Internet of
   Things (AIoT) and smart consumer electronics technology, Securing data
   privacy has become a top priority concern. The lack of computing
   resources in some consumer electronics (e.g., wearable medical devices)
   and the inherent security issues such as untrustworthy cloud service
   providers (CSPs) inevitably lead to unreliable data sharing. Therefore,
   how to ensure the security, efficiency and scalability of private data
   sharing with limited resources in consumer electronics is one of the hot
   topics. However, data encryption schemes that use a single authority
   typically have high key generation costs, and the data integrity of
   which can hardly be guaranteed. In this paper, we propose a
   blockchain-assisted, highly secure access control scheme for
   AIoT-enabled, human centric consumer electronics. The novel scheme,
   called ERACMA, supports expressive and revocable access control with
   multi-authority using attribute-based encryption. The scheme uses
   multiple attribute authorities to split the key generation, reducing the
   generation time of the decryption key. Blockchain is utilized to ensure
   the integrity of private consumer electronics data. Data source
   identification can be used by human-centric consumer electronics
   applications to determine the validity and legitimacy of data. The
   scheme also supports dynamic user group management to address the user
   license expiration issues involved in consumer applications. A formal
   definition and concrete construction of ERACMA are also presented, with
   a security proof under the random oracle. Extensive comparative and
   experimental analysis has revealed the superior functionality and
   efficient performance of our scheme which is well-suited for
   human-centric consumer electronics.},

Abstract = {Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is an emerging multi-disciplinary field
   aiming at exploiting information and communication technologies in
   personal healthcare and telehealth systems for countering the effects of
   growing elderly population. AAL systems are developed for personalized,
   adaptive, and anticipatory requirements, necessitating high
   quality-of-service to achieve interoperability, usability, security, and
   accuracy. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of
   the AAL field with a focus on healthcare frameworks, platforms,
   standards, and quality attributes. To achieve this, we conducted a
   literature survey of state-of-the-art AAL frameworks, systems and
   platforms to identify the essential aspects of AAL systems and
   investigate the critical issues from the design, technology,
   quality-of-service, and user experience perspectives. In addition, we
   conducted an email-based survey for collecting usage data and current
   status of contemporary AAL systems. We found that most AAL systems are
   confined to a limited set of features ignoring many of the essential AAL
   system aspects. Standards and technologies are used in a limited and
   isolated manner, while quality attributes are often addressed
   insufficiently. In conclusion, we found that more inter-organizational
   collaboration, user-centered studies, increased standardization efforts,
   and a focus on open systems is needed to achieve more interoperable and
   synergetic AAL solutions.},

Title = {Adolescents' assessment of a Family Medication Safety Plan for opioid
   prescriptions: A qualitative usability study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {63},
Number = {6},

Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Background: When children are injured or have surgery, parents can be
   hesitant to fill opioid prescriptions and youth may be concerned about
   using these medications to manage pain. Parents cite a myriad of reasons
   why they worry about their child using opioids. The MedSMART Families
   intervention, which includes a Family Medication Safety Plan (FMSP), is
   a tool designed to support families in learning and communicating about
   safe prescription opioid use in their homes and with health care
   providers.
   Objective: This study's first aim was to examine adolescents'
   experiences with using the FMSP. The second aim of this study was to
   identify opportunities for future improvement.
   Methods: Adolescents, aged 12-18 years, were recruited from April 2021
   to October 2021. They were recruited through Qualtrics research panels,
   email listservs, social media, and snowball sampling. Adolescents
   reviewed the FMSP and then completed a semistructured follow-up
   interview with a study team member virtually. The interviews were
   professionally transcribed verbatim, reviewed by the study team for
   accuracy, and downloaded into NVivo for analysis. Main themes were
   identified using content and thematic analysis.
   Results: Adolescents (N = 65) reviewed the FMSP and participated in the
   study. Adolescents found the FMSP to be acceptable and useful for
   prompting discussions with parents about not only opioids, but all
   medications being used by the youth. Study participants suggested key
   improvements such as the creation of a kid-friendly or Spanish language
   version to improve accessibility and uptake by a diverse population of
   teens.
   Conclusion: Adolescents reported that the FMSP would be a helpful tool
   for their families. Implementing this tool at the point of prescribing
   or dispensing is a potential strategy to reduce the rates of opioid
   misuse, reduce hesitancy, and allow adolescents more agency regarding
   their health care and medication management. (c) 2023 American

Abstract = {Social Networking sites nowadays use passwords to authenticate users.
   But there are certain problems with this; the user may forget his
   password or the account may be hacked by the attacker. The web services
   nowadays provide users' with an alternative email address or security
   question to recover password. Unfortunately, this authentication
   mechanism is insecure or unreliable.
   To overcome the drawbacks of this mechanism, a backup mechanism for
   account recovery is considered. Backup authentication mechanism helps
   the users' to regain accounts with the help of trusted friends. In this
   mechanism user depends on multiple trustees and recover their account
   via verification mails. A trust model which is implemented in social
   networking sites is associated with an authentication protocol. Trust
   evaluation models are really needed in smart environments is that they

Title = {An Effective Double-Layer Detection System Against Social Engineering
   Attacks},

Abstract = {In recent years, social engineering attacks that use phishing emails as
   the medium and target specific groups of people have occurred
   frequently. Current enterprise systems are vulnerable to social
   engineering attacks. In addition, existing detection methods are
   relatively ineffective. Therefore, we propose a double-layer detection
   framework based on deep learning technology. First, a phishing email
   detection model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and extreme
   gradient boosting tree (XGBoost) is designed from the perspective of
   individual security. Then, an insider threat detection model based on
   Bidirectional LSTM and Attention mechanism is designed from the
   perspective of group security. Finally, combined with the social
   engineering network attack simulation theory, a social engineering
   attack and defense simulation platform is established. In the
   double-layer frame-work, we use Bi-LSTM to obtain long-range dependent
   features of email body and user sequence information. Then XGBoost and
   Attention mechanism are used to further strengthen the network structure
   and improve the classification accuracy. Compared with traditional
   methods, our model does not require manual feature extraction, and can
   accurately identify phishing emails and insider threats. Finally, our
   proposed social engineering simulation platform verifies the
   effectiveness of the two-layer model. The experimental results show that
   our proposed framework has the characteristics of timely detection and
   after-the-fact investigation, which can effectively detect phishing
   attacks and insider threats faced by enterprise systems.},

Abstract = {A 3D image can be used for the authentications as it gives more
   accuracy. We can also use the gestures for the authentication purpose.
   We can add multiple authentication levels together to make system more
   secure and login process more reliable. In our system we are going to
   provide three levels of authentication i.e. 1) Text Password: -This is
   first level in which user has to enter the text password which is OTP.
   OTP will be sent to the registered email-id or at the mobile number
   given. With
   The help of AES (advance encryption standard) algorithm the data will be
   encrypt and store at database server.2) Hand Gesture Recognition: -This
   is second level in which user has to place this hand in front of camera.
   So camera can detect it,select one point out of 22 points on the hand
   whatever pattern user make in front of camera is saved as password at
   user's database.
   3) Face Recognition: -This is last level in which user has to place face
   in front of camera. So camera can detect the face and select 78 landmark
   points. And those points are saved at the user's database. After passing
   all these stages user is authenticate and can upload or download the
   documents of his/her choice.},

Abstract = {Indonesian government has been mandated in presidential decree regarding
   bureaucratic reform to realize its commitment to implement electronic
   government (e-government) based on Information and Communication
   Technology (ICT). This notion has caused the dependency of business
   process functions of government services to the public, using ICTs.
   Increased use of ICTs leads to high levels of vulnerability that can be
   exploited by major threats. The largest source of the information
   security breaches is due to a lack of awareness of the human aspect.
   Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) RI has a strategic problem concerning
   the awareness of employees. This study measured awareness of information
   security. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to assess the
   importance of each of those dimensions through pairwise comparison.
   Measurements conducted using questionnaire to all employees of the MOFA.
   Focus areas measured include: workstation security, password management,
   the use of email and instant messaging, internet usage, the use of
   social media, document handling, incident reporting, and security
   policies. The result shows that the security awareness of employees at
   the MOFA is at the average level, or in need of attention and
   supervision.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Australia's novel, active surveillance system,
   AusVaxSafety, monitors the post-market safety of vaccines in near real
   time. We analysed cumulative surveillance data for children aged 6
   months to 4 years who received seasonal influenza vaccine in 2015 and/or
   2016 to determine: adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) rates by
   vaccine brand, age and concomitant vaccine administration.
   Methods: Parent/carer reports of AEFI occurring within 3 days of their
   child receiving an influenza vaccine in sentinel immunisation clinics
   were solicited by Short Message Service (SMS) and/or email based survey.
   Retrospective data from 2 years were combined to examine specific AEFI
   rates, particularly fever and medical attendance as a proxy for serious
   adverse events (SAE), with and without concomitant vaccine
   administration. As trivalent influenza vaccines (TIV) were funded in
   Australia's National Immunisation Program (NIP) in 2015 and quadrivalent
   (QIV) in 2016, respectively, we compared their safety profiles.
   Results: 7402 children were included. Data were reported weekly through
   each vaccination season; no safety signals or excess of adverse events
   were detected. More children who received a concomitant vaccine had
   fever (7.5\% versus 2.8\%; p <.001). Meningococcal B vaccine was
   associated with the highest increase in AEFI rates among children
   receiving a specified concomitant vaccine: 30.3\% reported an AEFI
   compared with 7.3\% who received an influenza vaccine alone (p <.001).
   Reported fever was strongly associated with medical attendance (OR:
   42.6; 95\% Confidence Interval (CI): 25.6-71.0). TIV and QIV safety
   profiles included low and expected AEFI rates (fever: 4.3\% for TIV
   compared with 3.2\% for QIV (p =.015); injection site reaction: 1.9\%
   for TIV compared with 3.0\% for QIV (p <.001)). There was no difference
   in safety profile between brands.
   Discussion: Active participant-reported data provided timely vaccine
   brand-specific safety information. Our surveillance system has
   particular utility in monitoring the safety of influenza vaccines, given
   that they may vary in composition annually. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {BackgroundTo assess awareness of ionizing radiation safety measures
   among Egyptian Urology Trainees and Urologists and see the effect of
   radiation safety courses on the adoption of these measures.MethodsThis
   Internet-based survey was conducted via https://www.surveymonkey.com/
   after approval by the Egyptian Urological Association (EUA). It was sent
   to all EUA members via email during December 2019. Participation was
   voluntary and questions included participants' demographics such as age,
   gender, years of experience, level of training and type of practice.
   Other questions assessed some domains such as whether the participant
   had radiation safety courses, and the extent to which she/he is adopting
   these measures during daily practice.ResultsA total of 142 Egyptian
   urology trainees and urologists responded to this electronic survey. The
   mean hours of fluoroscopy-guided endourologic procedures per week were
   4.32.1 h, and only 23\% reported that they always wear protective lead
   aprons. In terms of the thyroid shield, X-ray protective gloves, eye
   googles, a total of 70\% and 89\% and 89\% reported that they never wore
   it, respectively. The ALARA principle was known by only 24\% of
   respondents. About 94\% denied receiving any radiation safety courses.
   Participants who received radiation safety course reported significantly
   shorter FT during URS (p=0.04), PCNL (p=0.03) and JJ insertion (p=0.04)
   and were significantly more compliant (p=0.02). In addition, the number
   of years of experience (<5y,5-10y,10-15y,>15y) and the current job level
   (resident, specialist, consultant, professor) was significantly
   associated with higher compliance with lead aprons (p=0.006, p<0.001,
   respectively). On regression analysis, previous radiation safety
   awareness courses were the only predictor of good compliance with
   radiation safety measures (OR=2<plus/minus>0.73,
   p=0.009).ConclusionThere was a lack of awareness and implementation of
   radiation safety measures among all participants. Receiving radiation
   safety courses was the only predictor of good compliance with radiation
   safety measures.},

Title = {Using header session messages to anti-spamming},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5},
Pages = {381-390},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The Internet is popular, with email use functioning as the major
   Internet activity. However, spam has recently become a major problem
   impeding the use of email. Many spam filtering techniques have been
   implemented so far. Most current anti-spamming techniques filter out
   junk emails based on email subjects and body messages. Nevertheless,
   subjects and email contents are not the only cues for judging spam. This
   investigation presents a statistical analysis of the header session
   messages of junk and normal emails, and explores the possibility of
   utilizing these messages to perform spam filtering. The message head
   session, including the sender's mail address, receiver's mail address
   and time, which is of little interest to most users, also provides
   further information for anti-spamming purpose. A statistical analysis is
   undertaken on the content of 10,024 junk emails collected from a Spam
   Archive database, and 599 regular emails in company with 635 solicited
   listserv or commercial emails contributed by volunteers. Content
   analysis results demonstrate that up to 92.5\% of junk emails are
   filtered out when utilizing the message-ID, mail user agent, and sender
   and receiver addresses in the header session as cues. Additionally, the
   proposed approach may induce a low block error rate for normal emails
   for the sample utilized in this investigation. This low rate of
   over-block errors is a significant merit of the proposed anti-spamming
   approach. The proposed approach of utilizing header session messages to
   filter out junk emails may coexist with other anti-spamming approaches.
   Therefore, no conflict arises between the proposed approach and existing
   spam prevention approaches. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Once an individual employs the use of the Internet for accessing
   information; carrying out transactions and sharing of data on the Cloud,
   they are connected to diverse computers on the network. As such,
   security of such transmitted data is most threatened and then
   potentially creating privacy risks of users on the federated identity
   management system in the Cloud. Usually, User's attributes or Personal
   Identifiable Information (PII) are needed to access Services on the
   Cloud from different Service Providers (SPs). Sometime these SPs may by
   themselves violate user's privacy by the reuse of user's attributes
   offered them for the release of services to the users without their
   consent and then carrying out activities that may appear malicious and
   then causing damage to the users. Similarly, it should be noted that
   sensitive user's attributes (e.g. first name, email, address and the
   likes) are received in their original form by needed SPs in plaintext.
   As a result of these problems, user's privacy is being violated. Since
   these SPs may reuse them or connive with other SPs to expose a user's
   identity in the cloud environment. This research is motivated to provide
   a protective and novel approach that shall no longer release original
   user's attributes to SPs but pseudonyms that shall prevent the SPs from
   violating user's privacy through connivance to expose the user's
   identity or other means. The paper introduces a conceptual framework for
   the proposed user's attributes privacy protection in a federated
   identity management system for the cloud. On the proposed system, the
   use of pseudonymous technique also called Privacy Token (PT) is
   employed. The pseudonymous technique ensures users' original attributes
   values are not sent directly to the SP but auto generated pseudo
   attributes values. The PT is composed of: Pseudo Attribute values,
   Timestamp and SP\_ID. These composition of the PT makes it difficult for
   the User's PII to be revealed and further preventing the SPs from being
   able to keep them or reuse them in the future without the user's consent
   for any purpose. Another important feature of the PT is its ability to
   forestall collusion among several collaborating service providers. This
   is due to the fact that each SP receives pseudo values that have no
   direct link to the identity of the user. The prototype was implemented
   with Java programming language and its performance tested on
   CloudAnalyst simulation.},

Abstract = {Web password recovery, enabling a user who forgets their password to
   re-establish a shared secret with a website, is very widely implemented.
   However, use of such a fall-back system brings with it additional
   vulnerabilities to user authentication. This paper provides a framework
   within which such systems can be analysed systematically, and uses this
   to help gain a better understanding of how such systems are best
   implemented. To this end, a model for web password recovery is given,
   and existing techniques are documented and analysed within the context
   of this model. This leads naturally to a set of recommendations
   governing how such systems should be implemented to maximise security. A
   range of issues for further research are also highlighted.},

Abstract = {Technology is in a constant state of evolution, which allows for new and
   cunning cyber-attacks and tactics. Out of all these tactics, the
   exploitation of human cognitive biases in response to phishing attacks
   is challenging to defend against. The purpose of this study was to
   determine if humans could discriminate fraudulent Uniform Resource
   Locators (URLs) or links from legitimate URLs without the aid of
   specific hardware or software. We also explored whether simple textual
   manipulations were easier to detect compared to complex manipulations.
   Participants (N = 1044) completed the following: (1) A demographic
   questionnaire including their internet and email usage, (2) a
   role-playing exercise where participants were shown a series of emails
   from an inbox and had to select the action(s) that they would take, and
   (3) a series of questions related to technology and security to assess
   their prior knowledge and awareness of phishing. Results indicated that
   it was difficult for participants to correctly identify URLs when
   checking email. Results also revealed that difficulty in detecting
   simple textual manipulations versus complex manipulations was category
   dependent.},

Abstract = {The Web browser has become the dominant interface to a broad range of
   applications, including online banking, Web-based email, digital media
   delivery, gaming, and ecommerce services. Early Web browsers provided
   simple access to static hypertext documents. In contrast, modem browsers
   serve as de facto operating systems that must manage dynamic and
   potentially malicious applications. Unfortunately, browsers have not
   properly adapted to their new role. As a consequence, they fail to
   provide adequate isolation across applications, exposing both users and
   Web services to attack.
   This paper describes the architecture and implementation of the Tahoma
   Web browsing system. Key to Tahoma is the browser operating system
   (BOS), a new trusted software layer on which Web browsers execute. The
   benefits of this architecture are threefold. First, the BOS runs the
   client-side component of each Web application (e.g., on-line banking,
   Web mail) in its own virtual machine. This provides strong isolation
   between Web services and the user's local resources. Second, Tahoma lets
   Web publishers limit the scope of their Web applications by specifying
   which URLs and other resources their browsers are allowed to access.
   This limits the harm that can be caused by a compromised browser Third,
   Tahoma treats Web applications as first-class objects that users
   explicitly install and manage, giving them explicit knowledge about and
   control over downloaded content and code.
   We have implemented a prototype of Tahoma using Linux and the Xen
   virtual machine monitor Our security evaluation shows that Tahoma can
   prevent or contain 87\% of the vulnerabilities that have been identified
   in the widely used Mozilla browser In addition, our measurements of
   latency, throughput, and responsiveness demonstrate that users need not
   sacrifice performance for the benefits of stronger isolation and safety.},

Abstract = {A project that piloted the secure electronic preparation of examination
   papers ran during the first semester of the academic year 1998/99 at the
   University of Salford. The examination papers were transferred between
   the participants (lecturers, administrators and external examiners)
   using secure electronic mail. Security was provided by a managed public
   key infrastructure. Users were profiled and interviewed in order to
   determine the likely success of further roll out within the institution,
   as well as the user friendliness of the existing paper-based and
   proposed electronic systems. The project found that, while the
   technology worked for some participants, others had severe problems with
   installation of the software and failed to grasp key concepts. There
   appear to be formidable obstacles to extending the system to cover the
   whole university, including compatibility of equipment and the
   reliability of the network infrastructure. (C) 2000 Dr David Chadwick.

Abstract = {Despite two decades of research on automatic filtering systems, phishing
   attacks remain a serious problem. To alleviate risks from filtering
   failures, we design and evaluate the effectiveness of a new warning
   system on users' susceptibility to phishing. Our proposed technique
   highlights key sentences based on an analysis of the persuasive
   techniques used. An online mixed-design study (n = 604) shows that
   adding our highlighting technique outperforms existing warning
   solutions. It also identifies the relative efficacy of different appeals
   and the characteristics of susceptible users. Results show that adding
   our highlighting technique is useful even with false positives and false
   negatives. Inspired by this result, we propose an automatic warning
   generator. We created a small labeled dataset of suspicious sentences
   and used data augmentation. Our best models achieve F1 score of 99.95\%
   in detecting phishing emails and 88\% in detecting suspicious sentences.},

Abstract = {Cybersecurity remains a global concern, with phishing attacks posing
   significant threats. This study investigates cybersecurity awareness in
   the Philippines, focusing on phishing and homoglyphs. Using experimental
   designs and cross-sectional surveys, the research examines user
   awareness, cybercrime knowledge, email usage patterns, and abilities to
   filter phishing emails and detect homoglyphs. Findings reveal a high
   prevalence of phishing attacks, despite respondents' confidence in
   cybercrime knowledge. Variability in filtering and detection skills
   underscores the need for targeted awareness initiatives. Awareness of
   homoglyphs correlates with individuals' perceived detection ability,
   highlighting education's importance. Preemptive warnings effectively
   reduce phishing susceptibility, emphasizing proactive measures' value in
   cybersecurity. Additionally, AI algorithms show promise in detecting
   homoglyphs, offering potential enhancements for email security. This
   comprehensive approach underscores the importance of continuous

Journal = {APPLIED ERGONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {108},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Many cyberattacks begin with a malicious email message, known as spear
   phishing, targeted at unsuspecting victims. Although security
   technologies have improved significantly in recent years, spear phishing
   continues to be successful due to the bespoke nature of such attacks.
   Crafting such emails requires attackers to conduct careful research
   about their victims and collect personal information about them and
   their acquaintances. Despite the widespread nature of spear-phishing
   attacks, little is understood about the human factors behind them. This
   is particularly the case when considering the role of attack
   personalization on end-user vulnerability. To study spear-phishing
   attacks in the laboratory, we developed a simulation environment called
   SpearSim that simulates the tasks involved in the generation and
   reception of spear-phishing messages. Using SpearSim, we conducted a
   laboratory experiment with human subjects to study the effect of
   information availability and information exploitation end-user
   vulnerability. The results of the experiment show that end-users in the
   high informationavailability condition were 2.97 times more vulnerable
   to spear-phishing attacks than those in the low information-availability
   condition. We found that access to more personal information about
   targets can result in attacks involving contextually meaningful
   impersonation and narratives. We discuss the implications of this
   research for the design of anti-phishing training solutions.},

Title = {Detection and prevention of spear phishing attacks: A comprehensive
   survey},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {151},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The spear phishing is yet a great cybersecurity problem, and hackers use
   more sophisticated methods in their attacks. This study gives a holistic
   analysis of detection and prevention methods that are supported by
   examples in real time. The research has analyzed various spear phishing
   techniques which include email spoofing, social engineering, malware,
   whaling attacks. Detection techniques including signature-based,
   anomaly-based machine learning and hybrid approaches are examined herein
   with an emphasis on their strengths and weaknesses. User awareness
   training, email authentication, filtering, incident response planning
   and multifactor authentication were identified as important strategies
   to try out. A structured overview of the field is provided through
   systematic taxonomy for classification of these methods. The survey also
   considers legal frameworks and institutional policies that often go
   unnoticed regarding spear phishing prevention by incorporating
   perspectives from penal jurisprudence and criminology to bridge
   technical and legal approaches. Other critical challenges that have been
   identified include changing nature of spear phishing tactics; detection
   evasion; integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into cyber security
   defenses among others. Henceforth it offers insights into these
   challenges while proposing open research questions aimed at guiding
   future research initiatives coupled with encouraging collaborations
   between academia industry policy makers. Such contributions will help
   develop more effective adaptive strategies against this persistent
   threat.},

Title = {STALE: A Scalable and Secure Trans-Border Authentication Scheme
   Leveraging Email and ECDH Key Exchange},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {14},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN 12},
Abstract = {In trans-border data (data transferred or accessed across national
   jurisdictions) exchange scenarios, identity authentication mechanisms
   serve as critical components for ensuring data security and privacy
   protection, with their effectiveness directly impacting the compliance
   and reliability of transnational operations. However, existing identity
   authentication systems face multiple challenges in trans-border
   contexts. Firstly, the transnational transfer of identity data struggles
   to meet the varying data-compliance requirements across different
   jurisdictions. Secondly, centralized authentication architectures
   exhibit vulnerabilities in trust chains, where single points of failure
   may lead to systemic risks. Thirdly, the inefficiency of certificate
   verification in traditional Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) systems
   fails to meet the real-time response demands of globalized business
   operations. These limitations severely constrain real-time identity
   verification in international business scenarios. To address these
   issues, this study proposes a trans-border distributed certificate-free
   identity authentication framework (STALE). The methodology adopts three
   key innovations. Firstly, it utilizes email addresses as unique user
   identifiers combined with a Certificateless Public Key Cryptography
   (CL-PKC) system for key distribution, eliminating both single-point
   dependency on traditional Certificate Authorities (CAs) and the key
   escrow issues inherent in Identity-Based Cryptography (IBC). Secondly,
   an enhanced Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key-exchange protocol
   is introduced, employing forward-secure session key negotiation to
   significantly improve communication security in trans-border network
   environments. Finally, a distributed identity ledger is implemented,
   using the FISCO BCOS blockchain, enabling decentralized storage and
   verification of identity information while ensuring data immutability,
   full traceability, and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
   compliance. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
   method exhibits significant advantages in authentication efficiency,
   communication overhead, and computational cost compared to existing
   solutions.},

Abstract = {Research has shown the incredible evolution of mobile marketing and, on
   the other hand, has also revealed that email marketing is still widely
   used. Online marketing has evolved considerably in recent times and is
   becoming a key for companies wishing to ensure their survival in the
   online market. Online behavioral advertising (OBA) is a tool that has
   leveraged the evolution of digital marketing, but it is causing a big
   debate on the Internet. Many say that when OBA is implemented, user
   privacy is seriously compromised, since the tracking of user
   information, without their consent, is key to the OBA implementation.
   Based on past and current needs of new marketing trends and trying to
   balance the dilemma of privacy versus OBA, a scheme was developed to
   safeguard user privacy, as well as allow for the continued evolution of
   the OBA.},

Title = {A Novel Uplink Positioning and SVD-Based Physical Layer Security Scheme
   for VLC Systems},
Journal = {IEEE JOURNAL ON SELECTED AREAS IN COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {43},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1706-1720},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In this paper, two techniques including uplink positioning and
   multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) singular value decomposition (SVD)
   beamforming are proposed and utilized to provide a novel physical layer
   security (PLS) scheme for visible light communication (VLC) systems,
   which much enhance the integrated location-sensing and data security
   strength. The paper first develops a closed-form mathematical model for
   ubiquitous uplink positioning using a single light-emitting diode with
   the trilateration algorithm, considering the field-of-view constraints
   due to the user's optical transmitter and access point receivers. SVD in
   MIMO VLC is subsequently introduced to exploit the acquired user's
   location to form a pair of public and private keys for secure data
   transfer over the physical medium. The proposed system performance is
   evaluated in terms of the root mean square positioning error epsilon(X
   )and the achieved bit error rate (BER) for the uplink positioning and
   the downlink data transmission, respectively. Results show that the
   effective area of the photodiode significantly impacts epsilon(X ), with
   smaller areas resulting in higher epsilon(X ). It is also observed that
   the epsilon(X )directly relates to the strength of ambient light
   inducing noise in the system. However, the proposed uplink positioning
   is less prone to natural ambient light as compared to the traditional
   downlink visible light positioning. The BER analysis of the downlink
   data transmission shows that the proposed SVD-based PLS enhances the
   system's confidentiality by significantly narrowing the communication
   zone area by over 90\% in comparison to the zero-forcing beamforming
   scheme and achieves reasonable secrecy capacity.},

Abstract = {Physicians are often unaware of the results of tests pending at
   discharge (TPADs). The authors designed and implemented an automated
   system to notify the responsible inpatient physician of the finalized
   results of TPADs using secure, network email. The system coordinates a
   series of electronic events triggered by the discharge time stamp and
   sends an email to the identified discharging attending physician once
   finalized results are available. A carbon copy is sent to the primary
   care physicians in order to facilitate communication and the subsequent
   transfer of responsibility. Logic was incorporated to suppress selected
   tests and to limit notification volume. The system was activated for
   patients with TPADs discharged by randomly selected inpatient-attending
   physicians during a 6-month pilot. They received approximately 1.6 email
   notifications per discharged patient with TPADs. Eighty-four per cent of
   inpatient-attending physicians receiving automated email notifications
   stated that they were satisfied with the system in a brief survey (59\%
   survey response rate). Automated email notification is a useful strategy
   for managing results of TPADs.},

Journal = {SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {2},

Month = {JAN-FEB},
Abstract = {We define phishing as the practice of directing unsuspecting users to
   fraudulent websites with the intent of obtaining personal information to
   be used for illicit purpose by a spammer. We introduce a new
   anti-phishing filter, phishwish, that has a number of advantages over
   existing phishing filters: it does not need to be trained, as is the
   case with Bayesian filters, nor does it consult centralized white or
   blacklists to determine whether an email is suspect. Phishwish uses a
   set of only 11 rules to determine the veracity of an incoming email; the
   results can be used to quarantine the email or to alert the user. We
   compare the performance of phishwish to SpamAssassin, a popular open
   source filter, as well as the Google phishing filters accessed from the
   Firefox browser. Our results indicate that phishwish outperforms
   existing filters in identifying phishing emails, even identifying those
   originated by the `rock phish' gang, and that it aids in detection of
   zero-day attacks that were not caught by existing filters. Copyright (C)

   Participants were recruited through email and represented geographically
   diverse academic and non-academic settings. The interview included
   questions on culture of reporting and learning from diagnostic errors;
   data gathering and analysis activities; diagnostic training and
   educational activities; and engagement of clinical leadership, staff,
   patients, and families in diagnostic safety activities. We conducted an
   inductive content analysis of interview transcripts and two reviewers
   coded all data. Results Of 32 participants, 12 reported having a
   specific program to address diagnostic errors. Multiple barriers to
   implement diagnostic safety activities emerged: serious concerns about
   psychological safety associated with diagnostic error; lack of
   infrastructure for measurement, monitoring, and improvement activities
   related to diagnosis; lack of leadership investment, which was often
   diverted to competing priorities related to publicly reported measures
   or other incentives; and lack of dedicated teams to work on diagnostic
   safety. Participants provided several strategies to overcome barriers
   including adapting trigger tools to identify safety events, engaging
   patients in diagnostic safety, and appointing dedicated diagnostic
   safety champions. Conclusions Several foundational building blocks
   related to learning health systems could inform organizational efforts
   to reduce diagnostic error. Promoting an organizational culture specific
   to diagnostic safety, using science and informatics to improve
   measurement and analysis, leadership incentives to build institutional
   capacity to address diagnostic errors, and patient engagement in
   diagnostic safety activities can enable progress.},

Abstract = {The deployment of Internet based applications calls for adequate users
   management procedures, being online registration a critical element. In
   this respect, Email Based Identification and Authentication (EBIA) is an
   outstanding technique due to its usability. However, it does not handle
   properly some major issues which make it unsuitable for systems where
   security is of concern. In this work we modify EBIA to propose a
   protocol for users registration. Moreover, we assess the security
   properties of the protocol using the automatic protocol verifier
   ProVerif. Finally, we show that the modifications applied to EBIA are
   necessary to ensure security since, if they are removed, attacks on the
   protocol are enabled. Our proposal keeps the high usability features of
   EBIA, while reaching a reasonable security level for many applications.
   Additionally, it only requires minor modifications to current Internet
   infrastructures. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Year = {1992},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {525-531},
Abstract = {Remote commercial applications like databases, telebanking, electronic
   mail systems run security mechanisms based on passwords. Too many
   passwords per user become a security problem. The goal of this research
   is to design systems allowing `'password-less'' user access to network
   services while improving the security of existing password mechanisms.
   A system relying on one primary login with one password is proposed. A
   `'guard'' functionality on the user login host's side relays the
   application service suppliers' password requests to a password server
   which satisfies these requests with strong `'machine'' passwords. To the
   user, this system appears to be password-less. Application providers do
   not have to give up their current password security.
   Variations of this architecture and its protocols for three levels of
   increasing security are described, employing complete message traffic
   encryption, public key cryptography, trusted hardware and software and
   strong authentication devices like chipcards.},

Abstract = {Recent research has begun to focus on the factors that cause people to
   respond to phishing attacks as well as affect user behavior on social
   networks. This study examines the correlation between the Big Five
   personality traits and email phishing response. Another aspect examined
   is how these factors relate to users' tendency to share information and
   protect their privacy on Facebook (which is one of the most popular
   social networking sites).
   This research shows that when using a prize phishing email, neuroticism
   is the factor most correlated to responding to this email, in addition
   to a gender-based difference in the response. This study also found that
   people who score high on the openness factor tend to both post more
   information on Facebook as well as have less strict privacy settings,
   which may cause them to be susceptible to privacy attacks. In addition,
   this work detected no correlation between the participants estimate of
   being vulnerable to phishing attacks and actually being phished, which
   suggests susceptibility to phishing is not due to lack of awareness of
   the phishing risks and that real-time response to phishing is hard to
   predict in advance by online users.
   The goal of this study is to better understand the traits that
   contribute to online vulnerability, for the purpose of developing
   customized user interfaces and secure awareness education, designed to
   increase users' privacy and security in the future.},

Title = {Participant perspectives from the Indian Health Service Anticoagulation
   Training Program},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {35},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1091-1098},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background The Indian Health Service Anticoagulation Training Program
   serves to improve patient safety through advanced anticoagulation
   management training. Although post-program evaluations of program
   content were conducted at the time of program delivery, little is known
   about translation of these learned skills into clinical practice.
   Objective This research sought to describe levels of self-reported
   participant confidence in anticoagulation management; development,
   implementation, and performance management of both core and supplemental
   activities of anticoagulation clinics or services; and current
   anticoagulation clinical practices subsequent to participating in the
   Anticoagulation Training Program. Setting A federal Indian Health
   Service healthcare facility in Oklahoma, USA. Methods A cross-sectional,
   electronic mail survey was designed, pretested, and administered to 267
   eligible Anticoagulation Training Program participants from 1999 to
   2009. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and interpreted to
   identify areas of strength and opportunities for improvement. Main
   outcome measures Information about confidence in anticoagulation
   management skills; development, implementation and improvement of both
   core and supplemental activities of anticoagulation clinics or services;
   and current anticoagulation clinical practices was collected. Results
   After training, over 90 \% of participants reported agreement/strong
   agreement with statements about confidence in performing patient-care
   related anticoagulation activities. A smaller proportion (83.3-85.4 \%)
   reported agreement/strong agreement with confidence in measuring,
   analyzing and reporting anticoagulation outcomes. Improvement activities
   were more common than development or implementation activities (65.4,
   31.9 and 35.1 \%, respectively). Not having well established
   reimbursement procedures, lack of dedicated clinic space, and lack of
   dedicated personnel salaries (47.3, 38.3 and 32.6 \%, respectively) were
   reported as the most common barriers to developing, implementing or
   improving an anticoagulation clinic. Participants indicated that
   anticoagulation outcomes tracking was the most common supplemental
   development, implementation and improvement activity (37.9, 37.0 and
   43.8 \% respectively). Benchmarking was the least commonly reported
   outcomes-related activity by participants (33.6 \%). Although there was
   only a modest gain in the number of established anticoagulation clinics
   after attending the Anticoagulation Training Program, approximately 21
   \% of participants reported using skills learned to establish other
   disease state management clinics. Conclusion In general, a majority of
   participants reported high levels of confidence related to direct
   patient care activities after attending the Anticoagulation Training
   Program. However there is a need to raise confidence in performance
   improvement and outcomes management activities to align with current
   accreditation standards in anticoagulation management as the
   Anticoagulation Training Program evolves.},

Abstract = {Modeling and characterizing Internet traffic has been a widely studied
   problem since the conception of the Internet. The self-similar, bursty
   nature of the traffic has led to a number of conventional statistical
   models that unfortunately provide relatively weak modeling power.
   Recently, fractal analysis techniques have emerged to better
   characterize and model Internet traffic data. However, past research
   studies have focused on describing and quantifying the fractal nature of
   Internet traffic on user groups, instead of a single user. In this paper
   the authors investigate the issue of individual users exhibiting fractal
   (self-similar behavior) behavior across multiple application types.
   Using real Internet traffic traces (collected via Net-Flow logs)
   collected at a college campus for 30 days, our investigations reveal
   that in a number of application categories (http, chatting, p2p, email
   etc.) at least one user exhibits long-range correlations typical of
   fractal behavior. Of the 10 application groups, 7 had over 80\% of users
   demonstrating self-similar behavior with 3 of those groups having >
   98\%. Potential benefits of our study in the realm of smart health and
   network security, by reducing the dimensionality of large Internet
   traffic datasets, are discussed.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has seen widespread adoption across various
   industries, enabling cross-domain collaboration among devices. As IoT
   platforms that allows users to manage and control these IoT devices
   become more prevalent, the security of IoT platforms has come under
   increasing scrutiny. Cryptographic authentication (CA) has long been
   central to authentication but poses significant security risks, such as
   account takeovers due to credential disclosure. Unfortunately, CA
   remains the most popular authentication scheme for IoT platforms, making
   them vulnerable to phishing attacks. Current enhancement methods,
   including challenge-response protocols and multifactor authentication,
   are still susceptible to phishing and face usability issues,
   particularly in cross-domain collaboration systems where seamless access
   is crucial. This article introduces Context-Auth, a context-aware
   authentication scheme designed to defend against phishing attacks
   without requiring tamper-resistant hardware. By incorporating contextual
   features of authentication and access behaviors into access credentials,
   Context-Auth detects inconsistencies and strengthens security. Our
   scheme addresses cross-domain verification challenges in federated
   identity scenarios, ensuring high usability across various devices
   without additional requirement from users. We conducted comprehensive
   evaluations and security analyses to ensure that Context-Auth remains
   secure against potential threats. The experimental results demonstrate
   that Context-Auth effectively defends against phishing attacks launched
   by real-world phishing kits.},

Abstract = {Introduction: We developed a mobile phone logbook application called
   LogMyScan. The study objectives were to evaluate a number of domains as
   per the technology acceptance model.Methods: A prospective pilot cohort
   study was conducted using a version of LogMyScan and reported according
   to Statement on Reporting of Evaluation studies in Health Informatics.
   Prospective participants were directed to a website which provided
   information and links. Participants were recruited via email
   distribution lists and social media. A task list was provided, which
   included entering simulated scan data and navigating the application,
   prior to completing a questionnaire. Questions were aligned to
   technology acceptance model domains, and Cronbach's alpha was calculated
   to assess reliability.Results: There were 49 participants and 7 were
   unable to complete the image upload and editing step. Levels of
   agreement for usability, educational and governance/security aspects
   were generally good. The desirability of existing and proposed features
   was high for images and video clip handling, feedback and reflection and
   less for motivational notifications and benchmarking. Comments
   identified some limitations and issues on the Android platform.
   Cronbach's alpha demonstrated good to excellent reliability: 0.87 (95\%
   confidence interval, 0.79-0.91) for usability, educational and
   governance/security and 0.86 (95\% confidence interval, 0.78-0.91) for
   desirability of existing and proposed features.Conclusion: There was
   generally high perceived ease of use, usefulness, attitude towards use
   and behavioural intention to use LogMyScan. Further research is needed
   to evaluate LogMyScan for future iterations, allowing recruitment of a
   larger number of participants and evaluating user expectations prior to
   using, and at timed intervals after using.},

   better customer care and build trust with buyers by answering questions
   quickly. Buyers also feel more confident to ask for details and get
   answers using chat or call, without waiting for email responses.
   Challenges and design solutions regarding trust and safety, building

Abstract = {We assessed a data security system using biometric fingerprint

   Clinical cases were initially discussed between the referring physician
   and radiologist in Tyrol using a video-phone. Subsequent correspondence,
   including the transmission of images between the referring physician and
   the radiologist, was carried out by email using the security system to
   prevent unauthorized access to patient information. Seventy-eight
   teleradiology sessions were conducted using this data security system.
   Speed and stability of data exchange were unaffected by the additional
   security feature. The average log-on time to the system was 7.8 s. The
   average training time on how to use the system was 15 min. The
   radiologist was able to issue a final patient report using the system
   within 1.5 of the initial contact. The data security feature was
   user-friendly and did not hinder the normal teleradiology consultation.},

Abstract = {Patient empowerment is the enhanced ability of patients to actively
   understand and influence their health status. Information is the key to
   patient empowerment. Without information, children and families cannot
   engage in meaningful discussions or make thoughtful decisions regarding
   medical care. Information sharing is a model for patient interaction
   with the health care system that may significantly improve the care of
   children and families. This article focuses on information technologies
   that utilize user-centered design principles and interactive
   capabilities to facilitate information sharing and to empower children
   and families. Examples include electronic pediatric personal medical
   records, customized health information systems, and interactive
   physician offices with electronic mail (e-mail) and telemedicine
   capabilities. Ideally, these systems would all be integrated. Successful
   implementation of new technologies will require thoughtful attention and
   balanced solutions to tensions between information sharing vs security,
   and curatorship vs censorship. Issues related to access and the digital
   divide must also be addressed. Acceptance and usability of new
   technologies is predicated on close collaboration among physicians,
   researchers in informatics, librarians, educators, and other
   professionals with expertise in the human-computer interface. Child and
   family empowerment will be both the driving force and ultimate outcome
   of information-sharing technologies.},

Abstract = {The usage of Internet of Things (IoT)/ Bring Your Own Devices (BYOD) has
   grown up exponentially, as expected 50 Billion IoT devices will get
   connected by the end of 2020 in the world in smart city environment.
   Advancement of Human Driven Edge Computing (HEC) with 5(th) Generation
   Internet services also makes this more feasible. Use of IoT and
   increased demand of BYOD becomes one of the fundamental needs to
   increase the organization employee productivity and business agility.
   But it increased the significant risk of the cyber-attack which is
   leading a major reason for business disruption and becomes a leading
   question about how to get a cyber secured citizenship in the smart city
   environment as well as in the organization where BYOD is used in large
   numbers. In order to conduct forensic investigation post incident
   detection of malicious activities from IoT/BYOD end point is most
   challenging task. A strategic practical approach in this research is
   presented to detect malicious activities so that organization can adopt
   to protect the critical infrastructure and smart city critical
   infrastructure. In order to achieve the goal of detecting of malicious
   activities in BYOD environment, simulation performed in 3 phases. The
   1(st) phase of the simulation performed while BYOD endpoint was outside
   the organization over the internet without VPN. The 2(nd) phase of the
   simulation was performed where BYOD endpoint was securely onboarded
   using a corporate wireless network with a secured onboarding process.
   The 3(rd) phase of the test done where IoT/BYOD was outside the
   organization with a VPN. A unique robust scalable model puts forward
   with significant result from this research and concluded for creating a
   cyber forensic ecosystem in IoT/BYOD environment to enable cyber secured
   citizenship in era of HEC with 5G and IoT.},

Abstract = {Increasingly, users access online services such as email, ecommerce, and
   social networking sites via 802.11-based wireless networks. As they do
   so, they expose a range of personal information such as their names,
   email addresses, and ZIP codes to anyone within broadcast range of the
   network. This paper presents results from an exploratory study that
   examined how users from the general public understand Wi-Fi, what their
   concerns are related to Wi-Fi use, and which practices they follow to
   counter perceived threats. Our results reveal that while users
   understand the practical details of Wi-Fi use reasonably well, they lack
   understanding of important privacy risks. In addition, users employ
   incomplete protective practices which results in a false sense of
   security and lack of concern while on Wi-Fi. Based on our results, we
   outline opportunities for technology to help address these problems.},

Abstract = {Phishing often causes more financial damages to enterprises and users
   than virus and worms. Proposed techniques so far mostly are to provide
   protection for the banks or other enterprise corporations and/or require
   changes in web servers. Regular home users are left without protection
   against phishing, other than the traditional rudimentary email
   filtering. Furthermore, security toolbars on browsers have been shown to
   be not effective. In this paper, we propose a light-weight user
   whitelist technique to provide protection for home users.
   We argue that for home users, whitelisting is advantageous over
   blacklisting, a popular technology. We show it is effective and
   efficient while imposing little burden on users and requiring no
   modification of servers.},

Title = {Persuasion: How phishing emails can influence users and bypass security
   measures},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES},

Abstract = {Phishing is a very dangerous form of social engineering with the aim to
   deceive people into disclosing private/confidential information. Despite
   widespread warnings and means to educate users to identify phishing
   messages, these are still a prevalent practice and a lucrative business.
   The authors believe that persuasion, as a style of human communication
   designed to influence others, has a central role in successful digital
   scams. Research on persuasion applied to phishing emails is scarce and
   tends to build on Cialdini's work alone. Only a single study has
   proposed a list of merged principles from three different perspectives
   but it has methodological limitations regarding the analysis'
   performance by a single researcher and the testing of principles in a
   small, not validated sample of phishing emails. This paper aims to fill
   those gaps by building on Cialdini's, Gragg's and Stajano \& Wilson's
   works to derive a unique list of Principles of Persuasion in Social
   Engineering (PPSE), resulting from the application of the relational
   method by two independent researchers. The PPSE are identified, by two
   independent researchers (Kappa > 0.789) on a sample of phishing email
   subject lines (N = 194), dated from 2008 to 2017 and randomly selected
   from a reliable phishing archive (millersmiles.co.uk ). A thematic
   content analysis, together with the sample characterization in terms of
   visual elements and targeted content, revealed that the most prominent
   principles of persuasion in phishing emails were `Authority', `Strong
   Affect', `Integrity' and `Reciprocation'. The larger percentage of
   references with the presence of visual elements was found for the
   `Strong Affect' principle. The use of the pronouns `you' and `your' was
   more evident for the categories `Strong Affect' and `Authority', while
   the employment of the pronouns `we, us, our' was more frequent in the
   `Reciprocation' principle. This paper constitutes a step further in
   understanding the use of principles of persuasion in phishing emails
   with future applications on how their recognition can be automated.},

Abstract = {Social networks are popular platforms for interaction, communication and
   collaboration between friends. Researchers have recently proposed an
   emerging class of applications that leverage relationships from social
   networks to improve security and performance in applications such as
   email, web browsing and overlay routing. While these applications often
   cite social network connectivity statistics to support their designs,
   researchers in psychology and sociology have repeatedly cast doubt on
   the practice of inferring meaningful relationships from social network
   connections alone. This leads to the question: Are social links valid
   indicators of real user interaction? If not, then how can we quantify
   these factors to form a more accurate model for evaluating
   socially-enhanced applications? In this paper, we address this question
   through a detailed study of user interactions in the Facebook social
   network. We propose the use of interaction graphs to impart meaning to
   online social links by quantifying user interactions. We analyze
   interaction graphs derived from Facebook user traces and show that they
   exhibit significantly lower levels of the ``small-world{''} properties
   shown in their social graph counterparts. This means that these graphs
   have fewer ``supernodes{''} with extremely high degree, and overall
   network diameter increases significantly as a result. To quantify the
   impact of our observations, we use both types of graphs to validate two
   well-known social-based applications (RE {[}Garriss 2006] and SybilGuard
   {[}Yu 2006]). The results reveal new insights into both systems, and
   confirm our hypothesis that studies of social applications should use
   real indicators of user interactions in lieu of social graphs.},

Abstract = {Trusting a computer for a security-sensitive task (such as checking
   email or banking online) requires the user to know something about the
   computer's state. We examine research on securely capturing a computer's
   state, and consider the utility of this information both for improving
   security on the local computer (e. g., to convince the user that her
   computer is not infected with malware) and for communicating a remote
   computer's state (e. g., to enable the user to check that a web server
   will adequately protect her data). Although the recent ``Trusted
   Computing{''} initiative has drawn both positive and negative attention
   to this area, we consider the older and broader topic of bootstrapping
   trust in a computer. We cover issues ranging from the wide collection of
   secure hardware that can serve as a foundation for trust, to the
   usability issues that arise when trying to convey computer state
   information to humans. This approach unifies disparate research efforts
   and highlights opportunities for additional work that can guide
   real-world improvements in computer security.},

   tool to teach cybersecurity. We present a pedagogical approach to train
   students to identify new threats and respond to mitigate them. This is
   accomplished through observatory, experiential, and real-life
   practice-oriented cybersecurity exercises. Seven malicious android
   applications targeting malware class and phishing, namely
   Email-Lite-Scare, Shop-Shock-Struck, Cyber-Safe Practices, Play-
   Read-Disrupt, Fish-A-Phish, Chat-Phish, and Spy-The-Trojan, have been
   developed. Psychological learning is emphasized in this approach by
   exercising the application extensively. The underlying goals of this
   work are to develop a security mindset, spread awareness on threats
   associated with smartphone/tablet usage, and to inculcate interest in

Abstract = {Phishing is a prevalent cyber threat, targeting individuals and
   organizations alike. Previous approaches on anti-phishing measures have
   started to recognize the role of the user, who, at the center of the
   target, builds the last line of defense. However, user-oriented phishing
   interventions are fragmented across a diverse research landscape, which
   has not been systematized to date. This makes it challenging to gain an
   overview of the various approaches taken by prior works.
   In this paper, we present a taxonomy of phishing interventions based on
   a systematic literature analysis. We shed light on the diversity of
   existing approaches by analyzing them with respect to the intervention
   type, the addressed phishing attack vector, the time at which the
   intervention takes place, and the required user interaction.
   Furthermore, we highlight shortcomings and challenges emerging from both
   our literature sample and prior meta-analyses, and discuss them in the
   light of current movements in the field of usable security. With this
   article, we hope to provide useful directions for future works on
   phishing interventions.},

Title = {Phishing detection tool for financial emails},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Phishing attacks have emerged as a significant cybersecurity threat,
   especially within the financial domain, where email serves as a
   prevalent vector for malicious activities. This project report outlines
   the development and evaluation of a Chrome browser extension tailored to
   bolster email security, specifically focusing on detecting and
   mitigating phishing attempts in financial communications. The study
   begins with a thorough examination of the techniques and tactics used by
   phishing attackers in financial email campaigns. A sophisticated
   awareness of the changing landscape of phishing assaults is required to
   develop successful defences. The key contribution of this work is the
   development of a powerful Chrome browser extension that easily
   integrates with common email services in the financial sector. This
   extension harnesses a blend of machine learning algorithms, URL
   analysis, and user-friendly interfaces to identify potentially malicious
   financial emails. It rigorously scans email content, scrutinizing
   hyperlinks and attachments for signs of phishing. The extension
   evaluates URL reputations, checks for typical phishing indicators, and
   examines email headers. In case any suspicious elements are identified,
   users receive real-time alerts, enabling them to make informed decisions
   about the safety of financial emails. To ensure the extension's accuracy
   and effectiveness within the financial context, an extensive dataset of
   real-world phishing emails and legitimate financial messages is employed
   for training and testing. The report offers a comprehensive analysis of
   the extension's performance, emphasizing its capability to detect and
   prevent phishing attempts in financial emails while minimizing false
   positives. In addition to its detection capabilities, the extension
   actively promotes user awareness and education regarding phishing

Abstract = {Over the past few decades, Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) has
   become a vital and extensive element of daily human life and activity.
   Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) have become the most promising
   components of ITS, which promises to enhance transport efficiency,
   passenger safety, and comfort by exchanging traffic and infotainment
   information to intelligent vehicles. Moreover, VANETs have emerged with
   new paradigms (e.g., Cloud, SDN (Software-Defined Networking), Fog
   computing, Blockchain, and AI (Artificial Intelligence) techniques) to
   provide strategic and secure communications to increase their
   reliability. Therefore, efficient and robust mechanisms, such as trust
   management, are essential requirements in VANETs. This survey provides
   an extensive overview of the VANET and trust management's main concepts.
   After that, we briefly review existing surveys, followed by the
   significant challenges of security and trust in VANETs. Then, we
   identify, review, classify, summarize, and compare related approaches.
   Finally, we give some future research directions.},

Title = {Perceptions of risk to patient safety in the pediatric ICU, a study of
   American pediatric intensivists},
Journal = {SAFETY SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {53},
Pages = {160-167},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Introduction: There is no study yet of the perception of risk in
   pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) physicians. The purpose of this
   study is to characterize these perceptions with respect to frequency and
   importance.
   Methods: The study is a cross sectional survey of physician members of
   the Society of Critical Care Medicine who report caring for critically
   ill children. Perceived frequency and importance of risks to patient
   safety across 11 domains in the pediatric ICU was obtained through a
   validated survey. Mean problem score was tested for trend across
   frequency categories.
   Results: 140 responses were obtained from 199 opened email invitations
   (73\%) and 822 total emails (17\%). The survey was internally valid with
   a Cronbach alpha value of 0.87. The most frequent risks to patient
   safety occurred in areas of ineffective communication, inadequate
   training and orientation, and poor hand hygiene. The most problematic
   risk domains were ineffective communication, healthcare acquired
   infections, inadequate training and orientation, and medication error.
   For most risk categories, as the perceived risk frequency increased, the
   mean perceived problem score of that risk decreased, excepting hand
   hygiene (p = 0.96) and central line infections (p = 0.27).
   Conclusions: Risks related to communication, training and orientation,
   and hand hygiene are perceived as frequent. Risks related to
   communication, healthcare acquired infections, training and orientation,
   and medication errors are perceived as the most important. Variance in
   attitude toward these risks is significant for most domains.
   Understanding variance will be important in changing human behavior
   related to risk in the PICU. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Real-time video surveillance based human fall detection system using
   hybrid haar cascade classifier},
Journal = {MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 8},
Abstract = {Human activity recognition is a burgeoning field with the aim of
   observing and understanding human actions, focusing on appearance and
   movement. The goal of this field is to develop advanced systems for
   creating lifelike models and facilitating interactions. Computer vision
   is the foundation, serving surveillance, robot learning, user
   interfaces, and human-computer interaction. CCTV advancements enable
   impactful applications like home nursing and elderly care through video
   surveillance. However, extracting behavior from varied camera sources
   remains challenging. This paper introduces a proof of concept: a
   cost-effective fall detection system using a 5MP Pi camera connected via
   MIPI. A three-stage hybrid Haar Cascade model coupled with video frame
   sequences, utilizing background subtraction, achieves 89.21\% accuracy
   with 2.5\% false positives and 2.0\% false negatives, surpassing
   state-of-the-art methods. The system's core purpose is to accurately
   monitor human movement, particularly detecting falls, and in
   emergencies, alert family via SMS or Email for the safety of solitary
   elderly individuals having age 60 years and above.},

Abstract = {Recently, targeted attacks are drastically increasing in both indivduals
   and companies. For technical countermeasure against such a targeted
   attack, various methods such as email/web contents analysis etc., are
   developed and realized. However, as it is often said, attackers
   precisely exploit the most vulnerable part in order to achieve their
   goals.
   Therefore, spear phishing against human user is employed for such
   attacks in a large propotion. Moreover, in order to increase success
   probability of such attacks, attackers often adopt social engineering
   technique.
   In this paper, we present a current effort of our research group on
   combating targeted attacks employing spear phishing with using social
   engineering, through user education.
   Specifically, at first we present relationship between human
   psychological characteristics and vulnerability against social
   engineering. The result can be used for testing whether a user has
   vulnerability on some social engineering technique, and the testing
   result can be utilized for countermeasure or user's training.
   Secondly, we present development of a web-based self learning material
   for countermeasure against social engineering which employs interactive
   motion picture contents.},

Title = {Public-key encryption with bidirectional keyword search and its
   application to encrypted emails},
Journal = {COMPUTER STANDARDS \& INTERFACES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {78},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {A traditional Public-key Encryption scheme with Keyword Search (PEKS)
   allows multiple senders to encrypt keywords under the public key of a
   receiver such that the receiver can search on these encrypted keywords
   using his/her searching secret key. In encrypted email systems, an email
   user not only needs to search on encrypted emails received from other
   users, but also needs to search on encrypted emails sent to other users.
   Motivated by this, the paper proposes a cryptographic method to allow
   these two types of user (i.e., senders and receivers) to search on
   encrypted keywords, which is called Public-key Encryption with
   Bidirectional Keyword Search (PEBKS). We give formal definitions of a
   PEBKS scheme and its indistinguishable security model to capture the
   scenario that no adversary can efficiently distinguish two ciphertexts
   of keywords from each other, even if the adversary can adaptively obtain
   search trapdoors of many keywords. Specifically, we propose a concrete
   PEBKS scheme, whose security relies on a standard hard problem, i.e.,
   bilinear Diffie-Hellman problem, in the random oracle model. Finally, we
   simulate the proposed PEBKS scheme to assess its practicability and
   convinces that its feasibility to be applied to encrypted email systems.},

Abstract = {The idea of an internet of things (IoT)-based smart city evolves with
   the aim of improving the quality of citizens' lives through the practice
   of data and announcement (such as email, connection, etc.) tools. The
   idea of smart cities is believed to be feasible through the
   incorporation of new technologies such as IoT, automation and machine
   learning in which IoT plays a key role. When billions of slight
   strategies drive online and start sharing their information,
   confirmation has already described as a major security issue nearby the
   IoT. To exacerbate things, as internet technology advances, advanced
   hacker methods and new forms of threats arise after each other. It is,
   therefore, necessary to create efficient authentication protocol that is
   simpler and easier in order to free users from their anxiety and enhance
   their user experience. Smart card-based key authentication protocols
   have formed the normal in the latest years, featuring their
   exceptionally lightweight, easy-to-use equipment and low-cost apps. We
   proposed an efficient robust authentication protocol using the extended
   chaotic map in this article. The security of the proposed authentication
   protocol formally and informally evaluated to demonstrate robustness.
   Examination of the quality of the proposed authentication protocol has
   also given sufficient care of demonstrating the possibility of
   application in real-time requests.},

Abstract = {Phishing is a network type attack where the attacker creates the fake of
   an existing webpage to fool an online user into elicit personal
   Information. The prime objective of this review is to do literature
   survey on social engineering attack: Phishing attack and techniques to
   detect attack. Phishing is the combination of social engineering and
   technical methods to convince the user to reveal their personal data.
   The paper discusses about the Phishing social engineering attack
   theoretically and their issues in the life of human Beings. Phishing is
   typically carried out by Email spoofing or instant messaging. It targets
   the user who has no knowledge about social engineering attacks, and
   internet security, like persons who do not take care of privacy of their
   accounts details such as Facebook, Gmail, credit banks accounts and
   other financial accounts. The paper discusses various types of Phishing
   attacks such as Tab-napping, spoofing emails, Trojan horse, hacking and
   how to prevent them. At the same time this paper also provides different
   techniques to detect these attacks so that they can be easily dealt with
   in case one of them occurs. The paper gives a thorough analysis of
   various Phishing attacks along with their advantages and disadvantages.},

Abstract = {The impact of machine learning (ML) explanations and different
   attributes of explanations on human performance was investigated in a
   simulated spam detection task. Participants decided whether the metadata
   presented about an email indicated that it was spam or benign. The task
   was completed with the aid of a ML model. The ML model's prediction was
   displayed on every trial. The inclusion of an explanation and, if an
   explanation was presented, attributes of the explanation were
   manipulated within subjects: the number of model input features (3, 7)
   and visualization of feature importance values (graph, table), as was
   trial type (i.e., hit, false alarm). Overall model accuracy (50\% vs
   88\%) was manipulated between subjects, and user trust in the model was
   measured as an individual difference metric. Results suggest that a
   user's trust in the model had the largest impact on the decision
   process. The users showed better performance with a more accurate model,
   but no differences in accuracy based on number of input features or
   visualization condition. Rather, users were more likely to detect false
   alarms made by the more accurate model; they were also more likely to
   comply with a model ``miss{''} when more model explanation was provided.
   Finally, response times were longer in individuals reporting low model
   trust, especially when they did not comply with the model's prediction.
   Our findings suggest that the factors impacting the efficacy of ML
   explanations depends, minimally, on the task, the overall model
   accuracy, the likelihood of different model errors, and user trust.},

Abstract = {Key Transparency (KT) systems enable service providers of end-to-end
   encrypted communication (E2EE) platforms to maintain a Verifiable Key
   Directory (VKD) that maps each user's identifier, such as a username or
   email address, to their identity public key(s). Users periodically
   monitor the directory to ensure their own identifier maps to the correct
   keys, thus detecting any attempt to register a fake key on their behalf
   to Meddler-in-the-Middle (MitM) their communications.
   We introduce and formalize a new primitive called Multi-Device
   Verifiable Key Directory (MVKD), which strengthens both the security,
   privacy, and usability guarantees of VKD by leveraging the multi-device
   setting. We formalize three properties for a MVKD (completeness,
   extraction-based soundness, and privacy), striking a non-trivial balance
   between strong guarantees and the limitations imposed by a truly
   practical system. We then present a new MVKD system called ELEKTRA. This
   system combines the core of the Keybase KT system (running in production
   since 2014) with ideas from SEEMless (Chase et. al., 2019) and RZKS
   (Chen et. al., 2022). Our construction is the first to achieve the above
   multi-device guarantees while having formal security and privacy proofs.
   Finally, we implement ELEKTRA and present benchmarks demonstrating its
   practicality.},

Title = {Active Surveillance of Adverse Events Following Human Papillomavirus
   Vaccination: Feasibility Pilot Study Based on the Regional Health Care
   Information Platform in the City of Ningbo, China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Background: Comprehensive safety data for vaccines from post-licensure
   surveillance, especially active surveillance, could guide
   administrations and individuals to make reasonable decisions on
   vaccination. Therefore, we designed a pilot study to assess the
   capability of a regional health care information platform to actively
   monitor the safety of a newly licensed vaccine.
   Objective: This study aimed to conduct active surveillance of human
   papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine safety based on this information platform.
   Methods: In 2017, one of China's most mature information platforms with
   superior data linkage was selected. A structured questionnaire and
   open-ended interview guidelines were developed to investigate the
   feasibility of active surveillance following HPV vaccination using the
   regional health care information platform in Ningbo. The questionnaire
   was sent to participants via email, and a face-to-face interview was
   conducted to confirm details or resolve discrepancies.
   Results: Five databases that could be considered essential to active
   surveillance of vaccine safety were integrated into the platform
   starting in 2015. Except for residents' health records, which had a
   coverage rate of 87\%, the data sources covered more than 95\% of the
   records that were documented in Ningbo. All the data could be inherently
   linked using the national identity card. There were 19,328 women who
   received the HPV vaccine, and 37,988 doses were administered in 2017 and
   2018. Women aged 30-40 years accounted for the largest proportion.
   Quadrivalent vaccination accounted for 73.1\% of total vaccination, a
   much higher proportion than that of bivalent vaccination. Of the first
   doses, 60 (60/19,328, 0.31\%) occurred outside Ningbo. There were no
   missing data for vaccination-relevant variables, such as identity card,
   vaccine name, vaccination doses, vaccination date, and manufacturer.
   ICD-10 coding could be used to identify 9,180 cases using a predefined
   list of the outcomes of interest, and 1.88\% of these cases were missing
   the identity card. During the 90 days following HPV vaccination, 4
   incident cases were found through the linked vaccination history and
   electronic medical records. The combined incident rate of rheumatoid
   arthritis, optic neuritis, and Henoch-Schonlein purpura was 8.84/100,000
   doses of bivalent HPV, and the incidence rate of rheumatoid arthritis
   was 3.75/100,000 doses of quadrivalent HPV.
   Conclusions: This study presents an available approach to initiate an
   active surveillance system for adverse events following HPV vaccination,
   based on a regional health care information platform in China An
   extended observation period or the inclusion of additional functional
   sites is warranted to conduct future hypothesis-generating and
   hypothesis-confirming studies for vaccine safety concerns.},

Abstract = {Phishing is a constant threat to the online security of endusers. Since
   technical measures currently fall short of preventing phishing attacks
   completely, educating end-users is an important factor in reducing the
   risk of successful attacks. Here, game-based learning has emerged as a
   scalable, motivational educational approach. While learning games that
   focus on phishing emails have been created in the past, they mainly
   include simple game mechanics, which do not map to the complex decisions
   that are involved in recognizing malicious emails. To this end, we
   present a novel anti-phishing learning game, consisting of two different
   game modes: Either, players have to create phishing emails from given
   templates themselves, or they have to analyze emails for malicious cues
   and mark relevant parts. The game is designed for a broad target group
   of adult users with little to no prior knowledge about phishing. To
   facilitate immersion, the game content is generated automatically and
   allows for personalization. This paper presents the design,
   implementation, and a preliminary usability evaluation of the game.},

Title = {Two-User Gaussian Broadcast Wiretap Channel With Common Message and
   Feedback: Revisit},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {178-193},
Abstract = {The two-user Gaussian broadcast wiretap channel with common message and
   feedback (GBC-WTC-CM-F) is revisited. Traditionally, achievable secrecy
   rate of this model is achieved by combining Marton's coding scheme for
   the two-user broadcast channel (BC) and the secret-key based feedback
   scheme, where both of the two feedback links are used to transmit secret
   keys shared between the transceivers. Recently, it has been shown that
   for the Gaussian wiretap channel with feedback, the Schalkwijk-Kailath
   (SK) feedback scheme achieves its secrecy capacity. Then it is natural
   to ask: can we do better when applying the SK-type scheme to the
   GBC-WTC-CM-F? In this paper, we answer this question by proposing two
   kinds of SK-type schemes. Specifically, first, we propose a hybrid
   scheme where one feedback link is used to transmit a secret key, and the
   other one is used for SK-type coding. We show that this hybrid scheme
   may perform better than the existing one in some cases. Next, we show
   that Ozarow's extended SK scheme for the two-user Gaussian BC with
   feedback, where both feedback links are used for SK-type coding, is
   self-secure (satisfying perfect weak secrecy constraint by itself) and
   may perform the best. We further show that Ozarow's scheme is in fact a
   secure finite blocklength coding scheme, and extend it to the static
   fading SISO and SIMO cases. Finally, the results of this paper are
   further explained by numerical examples.},

Abstract = {While the advancement of digital technologies is making our life more
   convenient, the sensation we feel while using analog tools or
   contrivances might be lost with digital devices. It negatively affects
   the joy of or motivation toward using digital content, and often causes
   various problems related to content use when user's awareness declines
   due to the lack of sensory reality. For example, while we can
   conveniently send an email with a single click with today's email
   clients, we often experience email issues such as sending one to an
   unintended recipient due to mistouching or using a wrong address. This
   is caused by `sending an email' with a single click, which deprives the
   user of the sensory reality of the operation. This study focuses on the
   email client interface and aims to represent the sensation of mailing a
   letter by integrating the pressing gesture operation. In this paper, we
   propose an email client interaction (MCI) system which realizes physical
   movements of `sending a mail/holding out a letter' by the 3-dimensional,
   pressure-sensitive functionality (3D Touch). We also design an email
   interface to be operated only by gestures, featuring a 4-direction
   display interface, and devise a mechanism to detect / notify mistakes in
   the email content, using the function to give feedbacks of different
   pressure intensities. The study emphasizes the sensory reality of
   emailing tasks by integrating above functions and proposes a method to
   prevent email mistakes by improving users' awareness while emailing.
   Thus we present and consider a possible design method, which
   incorporates an element of sensory reality},

Abstract = {The distinction is made between regulation of the Internet in general
   and of e-mail. Five topics are presented: identity and trust,
   employment, contents administration, records management and security
   issues. In all of them the important step is to define the issues, and
   the actual regulation then develops from that of non-digital
   equivalents. The key finding is the need for education for all levels of
   user to clarify the issues. Simply not taking enough care seems to be at
   the root of many actionable issues. The characteristics of the medium
   are not being allowed for. The paper concludes with what we can put into
   a course right now and what relevant research questions could be asked.},

   Architecture Based on Behavioral Biometrics},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RELIABILITY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {74},
Number = {2},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Zero-trust architecture has received massive attention globally and been
   a significant development in the field of cybersecurity. Within
   zero-trust architecture, the continuous authentication (CA) strategy has
   been proposed to counter the network security threats posed by
   traditional static authentication mechanisms. However, most studies have
   focused on either device-to-device authentication or user
   authentication. This limitation results in risks of identity spoofing or
   credential theft despite the implementation of the CA mechanism, thus
   concluding the parity in significance between authenticating users and
   devices. Furthermore, considering the CA of users, it is essential to
   face the issue posed by user authentication fatigue. In response to
   these challenges, this work aims to introduce an unconsciously CA
   protocol (UCAP) based on zero-trust concepts and behavior biometrics.
   UCAP utilizes the behavior of keystroke dynamics as a main factor in
   consistently evaluating the user trust level. This method enables the
   continual updating of communication keys to preserve robust
   authentication of both devices and users. The robustness of UCAP has
   been examined through formal tools, while the experimental outcomes have
   shown satisfactory performance.},

Abstract = {The mobile era is marked by exciting opportunities for utilization of
   contextual information in computing. Applications from different
   categories-including commercial and enterprise email, instant messaging,
   social, banking, insurance and retail-access, process and transmit over
   the network numerous pieces of sensitive information, such as the user's
   geographical location, device ID, contacts, calendar events, passwords,
   and health records, as well as credit-card, social-security, and
   bank-account numbers.
   Understanding and managing how an application handles private data is a
   significant challenge. There are not only multiple sources of such data
   (including primarily social accounts, user inputs and platform
   libraries), but also different release targets (such as advertising
   companies and application servers) and different forms of release (for
   example, passwords transmitted in the clear, hashed or encrypted). To
   the end users, and particularly those who are not tech savvy, it is
   nontrivial to manage these complexities.
   In response, we have designed Labyrinth, a system for privacy
   enforcement. The unique features of Labyrinth are (i) an intuitive
   visual interface for configuration of the privacy policy, which consists
   of enriched app screen captures annotated with privacy-related
   information; combined with (ii) a lightweight mechanism to detect and
   suppress privacy threats that is completely decoupled from the host
   platform. Labyrinth supports both Android and iOS. In this paper, we
   describe the Labyrinth architecture and illustrate its flow steps.},

Abstract = {User authentication is necessary for the majority of online services. If
   users fail to authenticate due to the loss of an authentication factor,
   fallback processes allow users to regain access to their accounts.
   However, most of the proposed and deployed fallback methods have
   substantial weaknesses that degrade security, e.g., guessable security
   questions. This is even more serious since through account dependencies
   (e.g., password reset via email), additional accounts can be
   compromised. On the other hand, misconfiguration of (fallback)
   authentication might result in locking a user out of an account.
   To help users to analyze their account security and accessibility risk,
   we present the multi-account dashboard (MAD). The MAD evaluates account
   types, applied primary and fallback authentication methods as well as
   the formed account network. By analyzing dependencies and transitive
   risks, weak links are discovered and indicated, and improvements are
   suggested. We further propose a service authentication description to
   collect the required information in an transparent way. The MAD is
   implemented as a plugin of the password manager KeePass. A following
   small-scale user study evaluates the usefulness and usability of the
   implementation.},

Abstract = {This paper details the design and development of IoT based security
   surveillance system in buildings using Raspberry Pi Single Board
   Computer(SBC) with WiFi network connectivity. Adding wireless fidelity
   to embedded systems will open up various feasibilities such as worldwide

   of wireless sensor nodes and a controller section for surveillance.
   Remote user alerts, live video streaming and portability are the prime
   features of the system. WiFi enabled IoT(Internet of Things) module
   processes the sensor based events and sends the sensor status to
   controller section. Upon receiving the event notification, the
   controller enables the camera for capturing the event, alerts the user
   via email, phone call and SMS and places the live video of event on
   webpage. The IoT module eliminates the need of a microcontroller and
   wireless transceiver module in sensor node, thus it makes the node
   compact, cost effective and easy to use. The biggest advantage of the
   system is that the user can seek surveillance from anywhere in the world
   and can respond according to the situations.},

Abstract = {In light of the rise of malicious attacks on the internet and the

   propagation exploited by worms is through the victim's contact book. The
   contact book, which reflects the acquaintance profiles of people, is
   used as a ``hit-list'', to which the worm can try and send itself in
   order to spread fast. In this paper we propose a discrete worm
   propagation model that relies upon a combined email and Instant
   Messaging (IM) communication behavior of users in a scale free
   environment. We also model the effect in propagation based on user
   reaction when a threat is recognized, the installation and update of
   antivirus software as well as the network connectivity, arising
   conclusions about the behavior of the network infrastructure in presence
   of a worm. Our analysis is based on Wormald's differential equations
   method for approximating ``well-behaving'' random processes with
   deterministic functions.},

Journal = {HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Interactions between humans and American alligators (Alligator
   mississippiensis), often resulting in negative outcomes for both
   participants, have occurred for centuries in the United States. As both
   populations increased over time, contact and conflict with one another
   became inevitable. Although human-alligator conflicts have been well
   documented, there has been no detailed classification of risk factors
   associated with human activities immediately preceding, and in most
   cases precipitating, an encounter. Herein, we provide a ranking system
   to categorize different human activities, based on risk levels,
   immediately preceding an encounter with an alligator. To complete our
   review in 2021, we initially gleaned data regarding alligator attacks on
   humans from the CrocBITE website between the years 1734 and 2021. We
   augmented the details of each incident with additional information
   obtained by an internet search (e.g., Google) and then cross-referenced
   all information with existing literature (e.g., books detailing specific
   human-alligator interactions) and by communicating via email and/ or
   telephone with state fish and wildlife agencies. Our ranking system
   indicated that 96\% (26\% low risk, 48\% moderate risk, 22\% high risk)
   of the recorded human-alligator incidents reviewed were caused by some
   level of human inattention in the form of risky behaviors, often while
   participating in recreational water activities. These results highlight
   the need for increased and targeted public education concerning safe and
   responsible human activities in areas inhabited by alligators. By making
   a conscious effort to implement proactive and preventative safety
   measures, human injury and death as well as the needless destruction of
   alligators can be reduced.},

Abstract = {Human trafficking is a worldwide crisis and the U. S. Department of
   State's 2012 Trafficking in Persons Report highlights the critical need
   to address this issue both home and abroad. Today, it is estimated as
   many as 27 million people around the world are victims of trafficking
   into the sex trade and other forms of servitude known as modern slavery
   or trafficking in persons. ``Trafficking in persons{''} and ``human
   trafficking{''} has been used by the U. S. Department of State and other
   governmental and multinational organizations as umbrella terms for the
   act of recruiting, harboring, transporting, providing, or obtaining a
   person for compelled labor or commercial sex acts through the use of
   force, fraud, or coercion. Recent research reflects that the
   exploitation of people through trafficking, is being channeled heavily
   through cyber activity such as Internet service, local bulletin board
   service, or any device capable of electronic data storage or
   transmission including social networking sites like Craig's List,
   Facebook, MySpace, and email instant messaging, text messaging,
   fictitious employment advertisements, immigration assistance and online
   bride websites. The goals of the research include: (1) identifying some
   of the key present challenges in cybertrafficking investigations, (2)
   understanding the impact of cybertrafficking in our society, locally,
   nationally and globally; and (3) assessing the role of the private
   sector in regulating the Internet for human trafficking activity.
   Presently, human trafficking scholarship and education is in its early
   stages particularly as it relates to understanding victim protection and
   assistance, technological, evidentiary and surveillance issues and
   international legal frameworks for the prevention of human trafficking.
   Greater awareness and education is needed to assist in the challenges
   faced by our Executive and Legislative Branches as they address
   important issues of national security and the growing incidence of
   cybercrime. This paper will introduce common law legal doctrines,
   procedural and evidentiary tools, forensic analysis, and case studies
   that will assist in creating a deeper understanding of the impact of
   cyber activity on the human trafficking industry in the effort to find
   greater solutions for the prevention, prosecution and protection of the
   innocent from the growing incidence of cyber activity as it relates to
   human trafficking around the globe.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) connects enormous objects through various
   sensors to facilitate daily life by interconnecting the information
   space with the decision-makers. Security and privacy are, however, the
   main concerns in IoT due to the openness of communication channels and
   the unattended nature of common sensors. To provide security and privacy
   for sensors and users in IoT-based systems; in 2019, Zhou et al.
   proposed an unlinkable authentication scheme using bilinear pairings.
   However, the vulnerability of their scheme against sensor node
   impersonation attack as proved in this article renders the scheme of
   their work impractical and insecure. A pairing free lightweight and
   unlinkable authentication scheme for distributed IoT devices
   (PFLUA-DIoT) is then proposed in this article. The security of
   PFLUA-DIoT is proved using the formal method along with a discussion on
   its provision of security features. The performance and security
   comparisons show that PFLUA-DIoT provides known security features and
   provides better performance. Due to the avoidance of bilinear
   pairing-based expensive operations, PFLUA-DIoT completes authentication
   in less than half running time as compared with their and related
   schemes. Therefore, the PFLUA-DIoT can address the security and privacy
   issues of IoT, practically and efficiently.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveThis study aimed to explore the association of nurses'
   perceptions of patient safety climate with missed nursing care in labor
   and delivery (L\&D) units.MethodsWe recruited nurse respondents via
   email distribution of an electronic survey between February 2018 and
   July 2019. Hospitals with L\&D units were recruited from states with
   projected availability of 2018 state inpatient data in the United
   States. Measures included the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire Safety
   Climate Subscale and the Perinatal Missed Care Survey. We estimated the
   relationship between safety climate and missed care using Kruskal-Wallis
   tests and mixed-effects linear regression.ResultsThe analytic sample
   included 3429 L\&D registered nurses from 253 hospitals (response rate,
   35\%). A majority of respondents (65.7\%) reported a perception of good
   safety climate in their units, with a mean score of 4.12 (+/- 0.73) out
   of 5. The mean number of aspects of care occasionally, frequently, or
   always missed on respondents' units was 11.04 (+/- 6.99) out of 25.
   chi(2) Tests showed that six mostly commonly missed aspects of care
   (e.g., timely documentation) and three reasons for missed care
   (communications, material resources, and labor resources) were
   associated with safety climate groups (P < 0.001). The adjusted
   mixed-effects model identified a significant association between better
   nurse-perceived safety climate and less missed care (beta = -2.65; 95\%
   confidence interval, -2.97 to -2.34; P < 0.001) after controlling for
   years of experience and highest nursing education.ConclusionsOur
   findings suggest that improving safety climate-for example, through
   better teamwork and communication-may improve nursing care quality
   during labor and birth through decreasing missed nursing care.
   Conversely, it is also possible that strategies to reduce missed
   care-such as staffing improvements-may improve safety climate.},

Abstract = {Food waste is a matter intrinsically linked with the growing challenges
   of food security, resource and environmental sustainability, and climate
   change. In developed economies, the largest food waste stream occurs in
   the consumption stage at the end of the food chain. Current approaches
   for dealing with the wasted food have serious limitations. Historically,
   livestock animals had functioned as bio-processors, turning
   human-inedible or - undesirable food materials into meat, eggs, and
   milk. Contemporary treatment technologies can help convert the food
   waste into safe, nutritious, and value-added feed products. Recovering
   consumption-stage food waste for animal feeding is a viable solution
   that simultaneously addresses the issues of waste management, food
   security, resource conservation, and pollution and climate-change
   mitigation.},

Abstract = {There are a multitude of collaborative and network applications that are
   vulnerable to interference, infiltration, or attack by automated
   computer programs. Malicious programs can spam or otherwise disrupt
   email systems, blogs, and file sharing networks. They can cheat at
   online gaming, skew the results of online polls, or conduct
   denial-of-service attacks. And sophisticated AI ``chat-bots{''} can pose
   as humans in order to gather intelligence from unsuspecting targets.
   Thus, a recurring problem in collaborative systems is how to verify that
   a user is a human and not a computer. Following the work of Coates et
   al. {[}1], von Ahn et al. {[}2], and others, we propose several AI-hard
   problems in perception and cognition that can serve as ``CAPTCHAs,{''}
   or tests capable of distinguishing between human-level intelligence and
   artificial intelligence, ensuring that all collaborators interfacing a
   particular system are humans and not nefarious computer programs.},

Title = {A new bio inspired technique based on octopods for spam filtering},

Abstract = {Email is an important service to exchange information for Internet
   users, this important use of email made it the target of various
   disturbances, such as spam attacks, most of the time it's generated by
   advertising (Clayton 2003). Short Message Service (SMS) like emails are
   also the target of spam attacks, so it is necessary to make emails and
   messages safe from spams (Karami and Zhou 2014). This motivates the
   researchers to provide new solutions which can filter and detect spams
   based on heuristic techniques represented by the inspiration from nature
   (or bio-inspiration), it's a new discipline that studies the best ideas
   of nature, then imitates them and applies their concepts and processes
   to human problems (Tahir et al. 2017, Ferreira et al. 2014), after
   exploring the marine world we opted for the octopods, because of its
   high quality of defense, and even are not very used in the world of
   bio-inspiration. One of the most defensive animals in their life is the
   octopods, they have a great ability to avoid attacks from predators, and
   they make an intelligent system of security that is hard to break it
   (Octopus-defenses 2018). In our work we proposed a technique based on
   the natural function of the octopod for the purpose of detect spam sms,
   the technique is based on two objective functions, the first is to
   calculate the force of move of each message, and the second is the
   probability of messages of each class from the learning base.},

Abstract = {Spam emails have been a chronic issue in computer security. They are
   very costly economically and extremely dangerous for computers and
   networks. Despite of the emergence of social networks and other Internet
   based information exchange venues, dependence on email communication has
   increased over the years and this dependence has resulted in an urgent
   need to improve spam filters. Although many spam filters have been
   created to help prevent these spam emails from entering a user's inbox,
   there is a lack or research focusing on text modifications. Currently,
   Naive Bayes is one of the most popular methods of spam classification
   because of its simplicity and efficiency. Naive Bayes is also very
   accurate; however, it is unable to correctly classify emails when they
   contain leetspeak or diacritics. Thus, in this proposes, we implemented
   a novel algorithm for enhancing the accuracy of the Naive Bayes Spam
   Filter so that it can detect text modifications and correctly classify
   the email as spam or ham. Our Python algorithm combines semantic based,
   keyword based, and machine learning algorithms to increase the accuracy
   of Naive Bayes compared to Spamassassin by over two hundred percent.
   Additionally, we have discovered a relationship between the length of
   the email and the spam score, indicating that Bayesian Poisoning, a
   controversial topic, is actually a real phenomenon and utilized by
   spammers.},

Title = {Cybersecurity Readiness Model Based on Human Factors},
Journal = {ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JUN 19},
Abstract = {Human error is one of the leading causes of data and security breaches,
   as cybersecurity attackers prey on psychological manipulations to push
   users into performing unwanted actions or providing information. Humans
   act as a weak link in cyberattacks, and as a result, organizations are
   prone to phishing, business email compromise, and malware types of
   cybersecurity attacks. In this study, we identify the human-centric
   barriers and success factors that influence an organization's readiness
   to handle cybersecurity threats. Moreover, we develop a readiness model
   to help organizations assess and implement security practices for
   cybersecurity from the human factor perspective. We conducted a
   multivocal literature review on 120 primary studies to identify human
   barriers, success factors, and best practices that positively influence
   cybersecurity. The results show that researchers consider trust,
   ignorance, and a lack of technological knowledge the significant
   obstacles, while industry practitioners point to a lack of technological
   knowledge, negligence, and impulsive or reckless behavior as the primary
   barriers. On the other hand, knowledge, proactive awareness, and
   cognitive ability are the most significant success factors from both
   researchers' and industry practitioners' perspectives. We mapped the
   identified barriers to the CyBOK cybersecurity knowledge areas. Next, we
   used the identified success factors to develop a cybersecurity readiness
   model. The readiness model was validated by applying it to a real-world
   scenario using the case studies approach. This paper provides a
   knowledge base to develop threat prevention strategies for human factors
   in cybersecurity and assist organizations in devising approaches to
   tackle pressing security issues.},

Title = {Relevance of microbial finished product testing in food safety
   management},
Journal = {FOOD CONTROL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {60},
Pages = {31-43},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Management of microbiological food safety is largely based on good
   design of processes, products and procedures. Finished product testing
   may be considered as a control measure at the end of the production
   process. However, testing gives only very limited information on the
   safety status of a food. If a hazardous organism is found it means
   something, but absence in a limited number of samples is no guarantee of
   safety of a whole production batch. Finished product testing is often
   too little and too late. Therefore most attention should be focussed on
   management and control of the hazards in a more proactive way by
   implementing an effective food safety management system. For
   verification activities in a food safety management system, finished
   product testing may however be useful. For three cases studies; canned
   food, chocolate and cooked ham, the relevance of testing both of
   finished products and the production environment is discussed. Since the
   level of control of different processes can be largely different it is
   beneficial if the frequency of sampling of finished products and
   production environments would be related to the associated human health
   risk, which can be assessed on the basis of risk assessment and
   epidemiological data. (c) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Comparing Car-Following Behavior Patterns of Human-Driven Vehicles and
   Autonomous Vehicles in a Mixed Traffic Environment},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {26},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Human-driven Vehicles (HVs) and Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) will
   inevitably coexist in the future, resulting in mixed traffic conditions.
   Modeling car-following behavior in such mixed traffic is crucial for
   better understanding the differences in driving behavior between AVs and
   HVs, thereby facilitating the development of AV driving strategies to
   enhance traffic safety. In such mixed traffic, the car-following modes
   typically include AVs following HVs, HVs following HVs and HVs following
   AVs. Previous studies have compared the driving behavior of HVs
   following HVs and HVs following AVs, but few have considered the driving
   behavior of AVs following HVs in the comparison. To bridge this gap,
   this paper first decomposes car-following events in mixed traffic
   extracted from a Lyft level-5 dataset into driving primitives using the
   Hidden Markov Model with Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM-HMM). Then, the
   Latent Dirichlet Allocation with GMM (GMM-LDA) is introduced to cluster
   the driving primitives into different car-following behavior patterns.
   Based on the identified patterns, the differences across the three
   car-following modes are further explored. The results show that the
   driving behavior under three car-following modes differs from each
   other. Specifically, compared to the HVs following HVs mode, in the AVs
   following HVs mode, AVs tend to maintain car-following behavior patterns
   with a longer distance gap and adopt a lower speed to ensure safety.
   This study offers a comprehensive understanding of car-following
   behavior in mixed traffic, which will facilitate the development of
   human-like driving strategies for AVs and enhance the safety of mixed
   traffic.},

Title = {Phishing Happens Beyond Technology: The Effects of Human Behaviors and
   Demographics on Each Step of a Phishing Process},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {44928-44949},
Abstract = {Prior studies have shown that the behaviours and attitudes of Internet
   users influence the likelihood of being victimised by phishing attacks.
   Many scammers design a step-by-step approach to phishing in order to
   gain the potential victim's trust and convince them to take the desired
   actions. It is important to understand which behaviours and attitudes
   can influence following the attacker in each step of a phishing scam.
   This will enable us to identify the root causes of phishing and to
   develop specific mitigation plans for each step of the phishing process
   and to increase prevention points. This study investigates to what
   extent people's risk-taking and decision-making styles influence the
   likelihood of phishing victimisation in three specific phishing steps.
   We asked participants to play a risk-taking game and to answer questions
   related to two psychological scales to measure their behaviours, and
   then conducted a simulated phishing campaign to assess their
   phishability throughout the three phishing steps selected. We find that
   the attitude to risk-taking and gender can predict users' phishability
   in the different steps selected. There are however other possible direct
   and indirect behavioural factors that could be investigated in future
   studies. The results of this study and the model developed can be used
   to build a comprehensive framework to prevent the success of phishing
   attempts, starting from their root causes.},

Title = {Investigating the concept of participant burden in aging technology
   research},
Journal = {BMC GERIATRICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},

Month = {FEB 12},
Abstract = {Background Research participation burden, despite being an integral
   concept in research ethics, is not well-conceptualized in the context of
   the use of technology in research. This knowledge gap is especially
   critical for the older adult population as new technology solutions are
   increasingly embedded in clinical trials for this demographic. Our
   objective was to investigate how older adults conceptualize
   participation burden in contact for research participation and research
   trials using technology. Methods We developed and conducted an
   Internet-based survey consisting of 22 multiple choice and Likert-scale
   type questions investigating older adults' preferred means and frequency
   of being contacted about research opportunities, their willingness to
   use specific kinds of technology and their concerns regarding technology
   use in clinical trials. We received a total of 273 completed surveys
   from eligible participants aged 50 or older. Results Older adults
   preferred to be contacted about research opportunities monthly, over
   email. Survey participants were least willing to use monitoring devices
   and their biggest concern was the security of the storage of information
   gathered by technology. This concern was positively correlated with age.
   Participants indicated a preference to use technology daily, in short
   sessions, preferably in a way that can be incorporated into their daily
   routine. Conclusions Results from this work provide insights for the
   design of effective recruitment campaigns as well as technology
   interventions in clinical trials through minimizing the burden of
   research participation.},

Abstract = {Risk-based Authentication (RBA) is an adaptive security measure that
   improves the security of password-based authentication by protecting
   against credential stuffing, password guessing, or phishing attacks. RBA
   monitors extra features during login and requests for an additional
   authentication step if the observed feature values deviate from the
   usual ones in the login history. In state-of-the-art RBA
   re-authentication deployments, users receive an email with a numerical
   code in its body, which must be entered on the online service. Although
   this procedure has a major impact on RBA's time exposure and usability,
   these aspects were not studied so far. We introduce two RBA
   reauthentication variants supplementing the de facto standard with a
   link-based and another code-based approach. Then, we present the results
   of a between-group study (N = 592) to evaluate these three approaches.
   Our observations show with significant results that there is potential
   to speed up the RBA re-authentication process without reducing neither
   its security properties nor its security perception. The link-based
   re-authentication via ``magic links{''}, however, makes users
   significantly more anxious than the code-based approaches when perceived
   for the first time. Our evaluations underline the fact that RBA
   re-authentication is not a uniform procedure. We summarize our findings
   and provide recommendations.},

Abstract = {Phishing is a form of online identity theft that aims to steal sensitive

   According to a study by Gartner, 57 million US Internet users have
   identified the receipt of email linked to phishing scams and similar to
   2 million of them are estimated to have been tricked into giving away
   sensitive information. This paper presents a novel browser extension,
   AntiPhish, that aims to protect users against spoofed web site-based
   phishing attacks. To this end, AntiPhish tracks the sensitive
   information of a user and generates warnings whenever the user attempts
   to give away this information to a web site that is considered

Abstract = {Ransomware is currently one of the biggest threats in malware attacks.
   Although the first known attack occurred in 1989, only in the last 6
   years has this threat greatly increased and become more sophisticated.
   The lack of adequate security measures and awareness propelled the rapid
   spread and increased severity of ransomware variants (e.g., WannaCry
   ransomware in 2017). Further, there is little research work on this
   matter, only traditional protections are available and even
   state-of-the-art mobile malware detection approaches are still
   ineffective. This greatly increases the attack surface on the mobile
   domain. To better understand the research work performed on this
   subject, this paper presents a detailed review of the literature on
   ransomware, existing mainly since 2015. Results show that most work
   focus on the analysis of ransomware structures and development/testing
   of detection solutions. Very few studies focus on human related
   solutions or ransomware prevention. This paper also presents an analysis
   of a sample of ransomware email subject lines regarding the integration
   of persuasion content and targeted/personal aspects, so to identify and
   understand more human aspects of the attack. In order to avoid mistakes
   similar to other social engineering malware research approaches (e.g.,
   email phishing and scams), which have been more comprehensively studied,
   ransomware research direction must be completely reversed. It must focus
   mainly on prevention and backup/restoring procedures, which are related
   to socio-technical solutions that can manage and understand users'
   awareness, workflow, behaviours and needs.},

Abstract = {Phishing is one of the biggest security threats to organizations.
   Anti-phishing awareness measures can improve phishing email detection
   rates. These measures need to be efficient, effective, and have an
   enduring impact over months, rather than days. Related research provides
   evidence of their effectiveness in the short term. However, questions
   remain as to how long this impact endures. We conducted a retention user
   study in two phases, with almost 200 participants in the first phase and
   almost 80 in the second phase, to determine whether a five-minute video
   retains its effectiveness five months after the intervention (similar to
   related work on more time-intensive measures). Our results suggest that
   short videos can indeed still exert a positive influence five months
   later. We also report on the video's influence on phishing detection
   strategies, as well as on viewers' confidence in this respect. Based on
   our results, we propose recommendations to inform the content of future
   awareness refreshment measures.},

Title = {Co-worker unprofessional behaviour and patient safety risks: an analysis

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR QUALITY IN HEALTH CARE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {36},

Abstract = {A key component of professional accountability programmes is online
   reporting tools that allow hospital staff to report co-worker
   unprofessional behaviour. Few studies have analysed data from these
   systems to further understand the nature or impact of unprofessional
   behaviour amongst staff. Ethos is a whole-of-hospital professional
   accountability programme that includes an online messaging system. Ethos
   has now been implemented across multiple Australian hospitals. This
   study examined reported unprofessional behaviour that staff indicated
   created a risk to patient safety. This study included 1310 Ethos
   submissions reporting co-worker unprofessional behaviour between 2017
   and 2020 across eight Australian hospitals. Submissions that indicated
   the behaviour increased the risk to patient safety were identified.
   Descriptive summary statistics were presented for reporters and subjects
   of submissions about unprofessional behaviour. Logistic regression was
   applied to examine the association between each unprofessional behaviour
   (of the six most frequently reported in the Ethos submissions) and
   patient safety risk reported in the submissions. The descriptions in the
   reports were reviewed and the patient safety risks were coded using a
   framework aligned with the World Health Organization's International
   Classification for Patient Safety. Of 1310 submissions about
   unprofessional behaviour, 395 (30.2\%) indicated that there was a risk
   to patient safety. Nurses made the highest number of submissions that
   included a patient safety risk {[}3.47 submissions per 100 nursing
   staff, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 3.09-3.9] compared to other
   professional groups. Medical professionals had the highest rate as
   subjects of submissions for unprofessional behaviour with a patient
   safety risk (5.19 submissions per 100 medical staff, 95\% CI:
   4.44-6.05). `Opinions being ignored' (odds ratio: 1.68; 95\% CI:
   1.23-2.22; P < .001) and `someone withholding information which affects
   work performance' were behaviours strongly associated with patient
   safety risk in the submissions (odds ratio: 2.50; 95\% CI: 1.73-3.62; P
   < .001) compared to submissions without a patient safety risk. The two
   main types of risks to patient safety described were related to clinical
   process/procedure and clinical administration. Commonly reported events
   included staff not following policy or protocol; doctors refusing to
   review a patient; and interruptions and inadequate information during
   handover. Our findings indicate that unprofessional behaviour was
   associated with risks to patient safety. Co-worker reports about
   unprofessional behaviour have significant value as they can be used by
   organizations to better understand how unprofessional behaviour can
   disrupt work practices and lead to risks to patient safety.},

Abstract = {In cloud storage, public key encryption with equality test (PKEET) is
   suitable for testing whether two ciphertexts generated from different
   public keys contain the same message without decryption. Recently, (Y.
   J. Wang et al., 2019) have proposed a public key signcryption scheme
   with designated equality test (PKS-DET). In this scheme, since the
   public key of the tester is used in the encryption, the tester needs to
   use its secret key to test the ciphertexts. Without trapdoor, PKS-DET
   prevents the attacker from testing the user's ciphertexts with the
   stolen trapdoor. Therefore, the privacy of the user can be protected.
   However, if the user in the PKS-DET wants to authorize the other tester
   to test his/her ciphertexts for some reason, the message needs to be
   encrypted again by the public key of the other tester. This will lead to
   higher computational complexity. Hence, the PKS-DET is not flexible to
   authorize multiple testers. In this article, we propose a construction
   of PKEET supporting flexible designated authorization (PKEET-FDA). The
   user in our PKEET-FDA can adaptively authorize multiple testers to test
   his/her ciphertexts, and each authorized tester must use its secret key
   to perform equality test for the ciphertexts. More importantly, the user
   does not need to encrypt the message repeatedly any more. We demonstrate
   the security of PKEET-FDA under two types of adversaries. Compared with
   the related efficient PKEET schemes, PKEET-FDA satisfies high efficiency
   from the point of view of the user. In terms of storage requirement, our
   construction is superior to the PKS-DET.},

Abstract = {Virtual reality training simulations to acquire surgical skills are
   important for increasing patient safety and save valuable resources,
   e.g., cadavers, supervision and operating room time. However, as surgery
   is a craft, simulators must not only provide a high degree of visual
   realism, but especially a realistic haptic behavior. While such
   simulators exist for surgeries like laparoscopy or arthroscopy, other
   surgical fields, especially where large forces need to be exerted, like
   total hip arthroplasty (THA; implantation of a hip joint protheses),
   lack realistic VR training simulations. In this paper we present for the
   first time a novel VR training simulation for the five steps of THA
   (from femur head resection to stem implantation) with realis-tic haptic
   feedback. To achieve this, a novel haptic hammering device, an upgraded
   version of the Virtuose 6D haptic device from Haption, novel algorithms
   for collision detection, haptic rendering, and material removal are
   introduced. In a study with 17 surgeons of diverse experience levels, we
   confirmed the realism, usefulness and usability of our novel methods.},

Abstract = {Through an academic-community partnership, an evidence-based
   intervention to reduce mammography appointment no-show rates in
   underserved women was expanded to safety net clinics. The partnership
   implemented four strategies to improve the adoption and scale-up of
   evidence-based interventions with Federally Qualified Health Centers and
   charity care clinics: (1) an outreach email blast targeting the
   community partner member clinics to increase program awareness, (2) an
   adoption video encouraging enrollment in the program, (3) an outreach
   webinar educating the community partner member clinics about the
   program, encouraging enrollment and outlining adoption steps, and (4) an
   adoption survey adapted from Consolidated Framework for Implementation
   Research constructs from the Cancer Prevention and Control Research
   Network for cancer control interventions with Federally Qualified Health
   Centers. The development of academic-community partnerships can lead to
   successful adoption of evidence-based interventions particularly in

Abstract = {Warning users about suspicious emails usually happens through visual
   interventions such as banners. Evidence from laboratory experiments
   shows that email banner warnings are unsuitable for blind and low-vision
   (BLV) users as they tend to miss or make no use of them. However, the
   laboratory settings preclude a full understanding of how BLV users would
   realistically behave around these banner warnings because the
   experiments don't use the individuals' own email addresses, devices, or
   emails of their choice. To address this limitation, we devised a study
   with n=21 BLV email users in realistic settings. Our findings indicate
   that this user population misses or makes no use of Gmail and Outlook
   banner warnings because these are implemented in a narrow sense, that
   is, (i) they allow access to the warning text without providing context
   relevant to the risk of associated email, and (ii) the formatting,
   together with the possible actions, is confusing as to how a user should
   deal with the email in question. To address these barriers, our
   participants proposed designs to accommodate the accessibility
   preferences and usability habits of individuals with visual disabilities
   according to their capabilities to engage with email banner warnings.},

Title = {Evaluating the effectiveness of email-based nudges to reduce
   postoperative opioid prescribing: study protocol of a randomised
   controlled trial},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Introduction Surgical patients are commonly prescribed more opioids at
   discharge than needed to manage their postoperative pain. These excess
   opioids increase the risks of new persistent opioid use, opioid-induced
   ventilatory impairment and opioid diversion. This study tests the
   effectiveness of two behavioural nudges, one based on peer behaviour and
   one based on best practice guidelines, in reducing excessive
   postoperative opioid prescriptions.
   Methods and analysis The study will be conducted at 19 hospitals within
   a large healthcare delivery system in northern California, USA. Three
   surgical specialties (general surgery, orthopaedic surgery and
   obstetric/gynaecological surgery) at each hospital will be randomised
   either to a control group or to one of two active intervention arms. One
   intervention is grounded in the theory of injunctive norms, and provides
   feedback to surgeons on their postoperative opioid prescribing relative
   to prescribing guidelines endorsed by their institution. The other
   intervention draws from the theory of descriptive norms, and provides
   feedback similar to the first intervention but using peers' behaviour
   rather than guidelines as the benchmark for the surgeon's prescribing
   behaviour. The interventions will be delivered by a monthly email. Both
   interventions will be active for twelve months. The effects of each
   intervention relative to the control group and to each other will be
   tested using a four-level hierarchical model adjusted for multiple
   hypothesis testing.
   Ethics and dissemination Using behavioural nudges rather than rigid
   policy changes allows us to target excessive prescribing without
   preventing clinicians from using their clinical judgement to address
   patient pain. All study activities have been approved by the RAND Human
   Subjects Protection Committee (ID 2018-0988). Findings will be
   disseminated through conference presentations, peer-reviewed
   publications and social media accounts.},

Abstract = {Electronic mail (e-mail) system are widely are used in Internet. A user
   usually needs to send an e-mail to a specific group of users via a
   secure delivery mechanism. In this paper, a new e-mail delivery
   mechanism using secure multicast key protocol with ID-based factorial
   number structure (ID-based FNS) is proposed in an encryption multicast
   system. In the e-mail delivery mechanism, the message of e-mail is
   required to encrypt first before sending out in order to safeguard the
   secrecy of the message on a public channel, such as wire-lined public
   switching communication links and wireless communication systems.
   Without loss generality, the public-key system is usually adopted in the
   multicast environment for the convenience at the easy key management
   need. As a manner of fact, the mechanism is having analyzed the space
   occupation; our scheme outperforms the existed methods in the way of
   magnitude order of reconstructing secure command key. Besides, the
   extraction of direct secure command key associated each intended
   receiver is fast operated to succeed the subsequent e-mail message
   recovery. Therefore, we provide a new and feasible solution for e-mail
   message encryption multicast in network system.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the functionality of smartphones has been rapidly
   improved; then, the smartphones are not only used for telecommunication
   but also for various applications, such as email and social network
   accessing. These applications raise new security issues to smartphone
   users; however, the current protection mechanisms of smartphones are not
   sufficient due to convenience issue and shoulder-surfing issue. We
   therefore propose a non-intrusive authentication approach based on
   touchscreen of smartphones. To the best of our knowledge, this work is
   the first publicly reported study that adopts the histogram features of
   touchscreen to build an authentication model for smartphone users. Our
   empirical results for fifty-five participants show that the proposed
   approach is feasible. The performance of the proposed approach could be
   increased if users continuously operate their smartphone after a period
   of time. Finally, we further discuss the applications and limitations of
   the proposed approach.},

Title = {The Moderating Effect of App Trustworthiness and User Attitudes on
   Intention to Use Adopt Mobile Applications Among Employees in The Oil
   and Gas Industry},
Journal = {SAGE OPEN},

Abstract = {In today's technologically advanced world, the adoption of mobile
   applications has become a transformative force across various
   industries, significantly impacting the way businesses operate and
   manage their processes. One area where mobile applications are making a
   remarkable impact is in the realm of Occupational Health and Safety
   (OHS). The integration of mobile applications in OHS practices has
   ushered in a new era of efficiency, accessibility, and data-driven
   decision-making, elevating workplace safety standards to unprecedented
   heights. Occupational health and safety are paramount concerns for
   organizations as they strive to create safe and healthy work
   environments for their employees. Historically, OHS management relied on
   manual and paper-based processes, which could be time-consuming,
   error-prone, and challenging to track comprehensively. However, with the
   advent of mobile technology, organizations now have the opportunity to
   streamline their OHS protocols, enhance communication, and proactively
   manage workplace risks, all through the convenience of mobile
   applications. This research aims to analyze the effects between
   perceived ease of use and the attitude towards the use of the mobile
   application. Perceived usefulness of applications on Attitude towards
   the use of the app, attitude towards the use of the app on intention to
   use the application. The population of this research is the employees
   from the oil and gas industry in Malaysia. The theory of the Technology
   Acceptance Model (TAM) was applied. Perceived danger, perceived utility,
   perceived ease of use, and perceived intention to use were the
   antecedents for mobile apps. Employees' intentions to use mobile
   applications were shown to be significantly influenced by their
   satisfaction with the information system and their inventiveness. In
   this study, devices were categorized as large or small according to
   their screen size, while respondents were categorized as young (<30
   years old) or old (>30 years old) according to their age. A data
   collection of 545 responses to an online survey with 32 questions was
   obtained for analysis. The survey was distributed via email to
   respondents using a Survey among employees. The factors impacting the
   intention to use mobile applications were investigated using structural
   equation modeling. We looked at the moderating impact of the app's
   trustworthiness on users' intentions to use/adopt it. The variables'
   responses for perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude
   towards the use of the App, trust (integrity) of the App, and intention
   to use/adopt the application varied significantly between the subgroups,
   according to the results. The study also showed the existence of
   moderating effects on the intention to use/adopt an app related to the
   trust integrity of the app. This paper discusses the survey, the
   findings, and the ramifications of the observations. This research
   contributes to the current literature by presenting empirical evidence
   on the importance of trustworthiness and user attitudes in mobile app
   adoption in the oil and gas industry. It also discusses the broader
   implications for improving workplace safety through the strategic use of
   mobile devices in OHS practices.},

Abstract = {Confidence tricksters have always defrauded the unwary. The computer era
   has merely extended their range and made it possible for them to target
   anyone in the world who has an email address. Nowadays, they send
   phishing messages that are specially crafted to deceive. Improving user
   awareness has the potential to reduce their effectiveness. We have
   previously developed and empirically-validated phishing awareness
   programmes Our programmes are specifically designed to neutralize common
   phish-related misconceptions and teach people how to detect phishes.
   Many companies and individuals are already using our programmes, but a
   persistent niggle has been the amount of time required to complete the
   awareness programme This paper reports on how we responded by developing
   and evaluating a condensed phishing awareness video that delivered
   phishing awareness more efficiently. Having watched our video,
   participants in our evaluation were able to detect phishing messages
   significantly more reliably right after watching the video (compared to
   before watching the video). This ability was also demonstrated after a
   retention period of eight weeks after first watching the video.},

Abstract = {Electronic communication is an emerging technique where we send
   information from sender to receiver in the form of E-Mail. To send and
   receive an Email, each user should have an ID. That ID must be locked
   with the unique password. The password is in the form of text. It may be
   alphabetical, numbers, alphanumerical and etc. Email servers provide the
   constraints to set the passwords, for the users. Even most of the
   servers secured, Black hat hackers hack the account and access the
   informations. A graphical password is an authentication system, that
   works by having the user select from images, in a specific order,
   presented in a graphical user interface(GUI). The most common computer
   authentication method is to use alphanumerical usernames and passwords.
   This method has been shown to have significant drawbacks. For example,
   user tends to pick a passwords that can be easily guessed. On the other
   hand, if a password is hard to guess, then it is often hard to remember.},

Abstract = {The study aims at discussing the security of medical data in the
   Internet era. By using k-anonymity (K-A) and differential privacy (DP),
   an algorithm model combining K-A and DP was proposed, which was
   simulated through the experiments. In the Magic and EIA datasets, the
   algorithm constructed was compared with K-A and the L-diversity model to
   verify the performance of the model. The model constructed based on DP
   had the lowest privacy-leakage risks, which increased with the number of
   identifiers in the Magic and EIA datasets, and the information
   disclosure was the least. In addition, in its usability analysis, it was
   found that its value was the most obviously improved and its operation
   efficiency was the highest. The K-A-DP algorithm can effectively reduce
   the risk of privacy leakage and information loss, and has achieved
   excellent results. Despite the deficiencies in the process of the
   experiment, the study still provides a reference for solving the problem
   of medical data security.},

Abstract = {In spite of education institutes subject their staff and students to a
   compulsory health safety course; however, many events have proven that
   college students do not follow the correct health safety instructions in
   case of emergencies. In this paper, an on-line exam of health safety was
   designed and implemented. PhP programming language was used to design
   the web pages of the exam while the data base was manipulated by MySQL
   language. The exam consists of about 20 specialized questions for each
   of all College of Science departments. The user should be able to access
   the exam through the website of the University or the College. Also, the
   user should register by entering his name, email, and password. After
   the exam practicing, the user will be notified about his score and if
   he/she put the correct or wrong answer for every question individually.
   The user can retry the exam again until he has got the full mark, which
   is the only mark that allows the examinee to pass the exam and then will
   be authorized to access the college laboratories and other workplaces.
   The student can know his mark through his email directly. The admin will
   also know all the examined students and their marks. Consequently, the
   college departments could be provided with a list of practiced students.
   The aim of this research focuses on increasing the education level of
   the health safety of the students and staff inside the laboratories of
   universities. So it ensures the entire workers at our laboratories will
   be conscious in case of any emergencies. Empirical results have been
   received by subjecting about 20 students in the college of science by
   measuring four knowledge parameters. Results have discussed the
   difference between the conventional manner of learning the health safety
   course through a brochure only and the proposed manner which is based on
   e-learning and on-line practicing.},

Abstract = {In today's digitized societies, phishing attacks are a security threat
   with damaging consequences. Organizations remain vulnerable to phishing
   attacks, and it is not clear how the work context influences people's
   perceptions and behaviors related to phishing attempts. I investigate
   (1) how contextual factors influence reactions to a spear-phishing
   attempt, (2) why people report or do not report phishing attempts, (3)
   which opportunities for security-enhancing interventions people
   identify. I use an in-situ deception methodology to observe participants
   (N=14) in their realistic work environment. I triangulate observational
   and self-reported data to obtain rich qualitative insights into
   participants' emotions, thoughts, and actions when receiving a targeted
   phishing email. I find that task, IT, internal and social context play
   an important role. The email's request being aligned with expectations
   and perceived time pressure when responding to emails were associated
   with insecure behavior. The social context positively infuenced phishing
   detection, but ``phished{''} participants did not tell anyone.},

Abstract = {The paper designs the Hybrid Messaging System (HMS) as an integration of
   electronic mail system and common mail system based on PKI (Public Key
   Infrastructure). A user composes mail through Web Browser and sends it
   to Web Server. CGI (Common Gateway interface) Program sends the mail
   received through the Web Sever to Post Office Electronic Mail Server
   using SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). The End Module of the HMS in
   a Post Office fetches the mail from the Post Office Electronic Mail
   Server using POP3 (Post Office Protocol 3), prints and delivers it to
   recipients. Also, the HMS can sign the mail with a signature private key
   that a CA (Certificate Authority) publishes for users. Also, the system
   encrypts the mail with a public key of a Web Server in order securely to
   communicate between a Web Browser and an end system.},

Title = {HiPass: Hijacking CTAP in Passkey Authentication},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {92086-92101},
Abstract = {Passkeys are designed to enhance the security and convenience of
   authentication by leveraging Fast Identity Online (FIDO) and Web
   Authentication (WebAuthn) protocols and utilizing credential information
   stored on user devices to securely complete the authentication process.
   This study explores the potential for Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks
   during the Passkey authentication process using the
   Client-to-Authenticator Protocol (CTAP). We applied existing MitM attack
   techniques to the Passkey authentication process and analyzed the
   outcomes. Through this analysis, we developed a scenario in which an
   attacker can use the victim's Passkey to log into the attacker's PC and
   explained why such an attack is feasible. Our implementation
   successfully hijacked the victim's session during the CTAP process by
   connecting the victim's authenticator to the attacker's PC via
   Bluetooth, thereby gaining access to the victim's account. By
   demonstrating the feasibility of this attack, our study highlights the
   need for more robust security measures in future implementations of FIDO
   and WebAuthn, which constitute the foundational technologies of
   Passkeys.},

Abstract = {Lateral phishing attacks can be devastating for users and organisational

   accounts that benefit from the implicit trust between sender and
   recipients. In this paper, we begin to explore the human-centred space
   of lateral phishing attacks through interviews with 5 security
   practitioners and 17 employees from the UK and India. We report how
   security practitioners predominantly rely on employees to alert them to
   compromised accounts, and how this can create a delay during which the
   attack can continue. Our interviews with employees, on the other hand,
   found that individuals may not be reliable; they struggled to detect
   slight changes to messages, and over-relied on markers that cannot
   identify lateral attacks. We discuss the symbiotic relationship between
   security practitioners and employees for combatting lateral phishing
   attacks within organisations, and present recommendations for improving
   resistance to these attacks.},

Abstract = {Repeat clickers refer to individuals who repeatedly fall prey to
   phishing attempts, posing a disproportionately higher risk to the
   organizations they inhabit. This study sought to explore the potential
   influence of three factors on repeat clicking behavior. First, building
   from previous research, we examined the impact of individual
   characteristics such as personality traits (Big 5 and Locus of Control),
   expertise (security and phishing knowledge), and technology usage.
   Second, social engineering tactics were considered as a potential
   factor, based on the specifications of the NIST Phish Scale, a metric
   for rating an email's human phishing detection difficulty. Third, the
   impact of contextual factors, such as world events, were investigated.
   Data was collected from study participants via a survey on their
   individual differences, followed by campaigns in which they were emailed
   a total of eight messages (four phishing and four controls) over a
   fourweek period of time. Repeat clickers were found to spend less
   timeworking online, check email more often, have a more internally
   oriented locus of control, and a lower need for cognition than the
   comparison groups. The Phish Scale resulted in difficulty scores closely
   corresponding to observed click-rates in phishing emails, suggesting
   that it is an effective metric of evaluating human phishing detection
   difficulty in a university environment.},

Abstract = {There has been a significant rise in ransomware attacks over the last
   few years. Cyber attackers have made use of tried and true ransomware
   viruses to target the government, health care, and educational
   institutions. Ransomware variants can be purchased on the dark web by
   amateurs giving them the same attack tools used by professional cyber
   attackers without experience or skill. Traditional antivirus and
   antimalware products have improved, but they alone fall short when it
   comes to catching and stopping ransomware attacks. Employee training has
   become one of the most important aspects of being prepared for attempted
   cyberattacks. However, training alone only goes so far; human error is
   still the main entry point for malware and ransomware infections. In
   this paper, we propose a multi-layered defense approach to safeguard
   against ransomware. We have come to the startling realization that it is
   not a matter of ``if{''} your organization will be hit with ransomware,
   but ``when{''} your organization will be hit with ransomware. If an
   organization is not adequately prepared for an attack or how to respond
   to an attack, the effects can be costly and devastating. Our approach
   proposes having innovative antimalware software on the local machines,
   properly configured firewalls, active DNS/Web filtering, email security,
   backups, and staff training. With the implementation of this layered
   defense, the attempt can be caught and stopped at multiple points in the
   event of an attempted ransomware attack. If the attack were successful,
   the layered defense provides the option for recovery of affected data
   without paying a ransom.},

   United States},
Journal = {HUMAN-ANIMAL INTERACTIONS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Objective: Hippotherapy is a treatment strategy used by occupational
   therapy, speech-language, and physical therapy clinicians to influence
   client outcomes through the movement of a horse. While hippotherapy has
   been widely researched among pediatric populations with neuromuscular
   disorders, limited evidence exists regarding hippotherapy for adult
   populations. This study describes the practice patterns, safety
   patterns, and changes in these trends over time for clinicians who
   incorporate hippotherapy into treatment plans for adult populations in
   the United States (USA). Design: A survey was distributed via email
   listserv to American Hippotherapy Association, Inc. (AHA, Inc.) and
   Professional Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship, International
   (PATH, Intl.) members for 5 consecutive years. Clinicians were included
   in the study if they worked with adults (ages 18-64), practiced in the
   USA and were licensed physical therapists, physical therapy assistants,
   occupational therapists, occupational therapy assistants,
   speech-language pathologists, and speech-language pathologist
   assistants. Descriptive analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel.
   Results: The majority of the clinicians were physical therapists (2019 n
   = 8; 2020 n = 21; 2021 n = 26; 2022 n = 20; 2023 n = 20) working with
   clients who had cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorder, or attention
   deficit disorder aged 18-26 and addressing neuromuscular client factors.
   Across the five years, <0.001-0.012 out of every one session included an
   emergency dismount, <0.001-0.003 out of every one session resulted in a
   safety occurrence that required on-site first aid, and <0.001-0.01 out
   of every one session resulted in an injury that required off-site first
   aid. Conclusions: The study findings describe consistent practice and
   safety patterns across time for adult clients with low numbers of
   adverse events. As the population ages, hippotherapy should be
   considered more often for adult clients. Clinicians can educate
   referring providers to advertise hippotherapy as adult-inclusive or
   age-friendly as appropriate. Researchers should examine the efficacy of
   hippotherapy for specific adult populations to guide the practice of
   clinicians incorporating hippotherapy into treatment plans for adult
   clients. Educators in accredited therapy programs and the AHA, Inc.
   should consider expanding their curriculum to include more
   adult-specific information for hippotherapy and draw attention to how
   and why the treatment strategy should be used with this population.},

Abstract = {Background and objective Physician awareness of the results of tests
   pending at discharge (TPADs) is poor. We developed an automated system
   that notifies responsible physicians of TPAD results via secure, network
   email. We sought to evaluate the impact of this system on self-reported
   awareness of TPAD results by responsible physicians, a necessary
   intermediary step to improve management of TPAD results.
   Methods We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial at a major
   hospital affiliated with an integrated healthcare delivery network in
   Boston, Massachusetts. Adult patients with TPADs who were discharged
   from inpatient general medicine and cardiology services were assigned to
   the intervention or usual care arm if their inpatient attending
   physician and primary care physician (PCP) were both randomized to the
   same study arm. Patients of physicians randomized to discordant study
   arms were excluded. We surveyed these physicians 72 h after all TPAD
   results were finalized. The primary outcome was awareness of TPAD
   results by attending physicians. Secondary outcomes included awareness
   of TPAD results by PCPs, awareness of actionable TPAD results, and
   provider satisfaction.
   Results We analyzed data on 441 patients. We sent 441 surveys to
   attending physicians and 353 surveys to PCPs and received 275 and 152
   responses from 83 different attending physicians and 112 different PCPs,
   respectively (attending physician survey response rate of 63\%).
   Intervention attending physicians and PCPs were significantly more aware
   of TPAD results (76\% vs 38\%, adjusted/clustered OR 6.30 (95\% CI 3.02
   to 13.16), p<0.001; 57\% vs 33\%, adjusted/clustered OR 3.08 (95\% CI
   1.43 to 6.66), p=0.004, respectively). Intervention attending physicians
   tended to be more aware of actionable TPAD results (59\% vs 29\%,
   adjusted/clustered OR 4.25 (0.65, 27.85), p=0.13). One hundred and
   eighteen (85\%) and 43 (63\%) intervention attending physician and PCP

   Conclusions Automated email notification represents a promising strategy
   for managing TPAD results, potentially mitigating an unresolved patient
   safety concern.},

Title = {Why people keep falling for phishing scams: The effects of time pressure
   and deception cues on the detection of phishing emails},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {123},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Lack of personalisation and poor mechanics (e.g., grammar, spelling and
   punctuation) are commonly cited as cues of deception that people can use
   to identify phishing emails. However, in an online email classi-fication
   experiment ( N = 472), we found no empirical evidence that the presence
   of these features was associated with better phishing email
   discrimination. We also manipulated time pressure and found that it
   significantly reduced detection accuracy. Participants rarely inspected
   the URLs associated with links in the phishing emails but, when they
   did, their detection performance improved. Better performance in
   distinguishing between genuine and phishing emails was linked to lower
   levels of an intuitive decision-making style and relatively lower
   education levels amongst a highly educated sample. Older participants
   and those with greater computer proficiency and stronger email habit
   showed a slight increase in ten-dency to judge emails as suspicious. The
   results are discussed in terms of intervention strategies such as cyber
   security training to improve resilience to phishing attacks.Crown

Abstract = {Phishing emails provide a means to infiltrate the technical systems of
   organisations by encouraging employees to click on malicious links or
   attachments. Despite the use of awareness campaigns and phishing
   simulations, employees remain vulnerable to phishing emails. The present
   research uses a mixed methods approach to explore employee
   susceptibility to targeted phishing emails, known as spear phishing. In
   study one, nine spear phishing simulation emails sent to 62,000
   employees over a six-week period were rated according to the presence of
   authority and urgency influence techniques. Results demonstrated that
   the presence of authority cues increased the likelihood that a user
   would click a suspicious link contained in an email. In study two, six
   focus groups were conducted in a second organisation to explore whether
   additional factors within the work environment impact employee
   susceptibility to spear phishing. We discuss these factors in relation
   to current theoretical approaches and provide implications for user
   communities.},

Abstract = {Humans represent one of the most persistent vulnerabilities in many
   computing systems. Since human users are independent agents who make
   their own choices, closing these vulnerabilities means persuading users
   to make different choices. Focusing on one specific human choice -
   clicking on a link in a phishing email - we conducted an experiment to
   identify better ways to train users to make more secure decisions. We
   compared traditional facts-and-advice training against training that
   uses a simple story to convey the same lessons. We found a surprising
   interaction effect: facts-and-advice training works better than not
   training users, but only when presented by a security expert. Stories
   don't work quite as well as facts-and-advice, but work much better when
   told by a peer. This suggests that the perceived origin of training
   materials can have a surprisingly large effect on security outcomes.},

Abstract = {Purpose - The discussion about firearms in the United States often
   involves a contentious confrontation between two polarized groups: gun
   owners and those that might increase regulation of guns. The former
   group often uses rights-based arguments, including the Second Amendment
   to the U.S. Constitution, while the latter assesses problems related to
   gun violence from a collectivist perspective, focusing on the health,
   social, and policy implications of firearm ownership. The National Rifle
   Association (NRA) adds to the mix through communicating and lobbying
   activities.
   Methodology - The chapter uses qualitative data and interpretive methods
   to gain an in-depth insight into the values of the gun culture and the
   role of the NRA in this community. Data used are from nine depth
   interviews with gun owners and field notes derived from participant
   observation in addition to examination of email communications sent by
   the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action.
   Findings - Three significant values espoused by members of the culture -
   self-sufficiency, safety, and privacy - are based on the individualist
   perspective and this perspective is reinforced by public narrative
   provided by the NRA.
   Research limitations/implications - A limitation is the geographic
   limitation on data collection, although it is expected that rural gun
   culture does not vary significantly throughout the United States. The
   study has implications for a more nuanced understanding of the gun
   debate in the United States by suggesting how the narrative is
   structured by lobbying groups such as the NRA.
   Originality/value of paper - This chapter provides insight into the U.S.
   gun culture that has not been previously addressed through a consumer
   culture theory lens.},

Abstract = {Email-based phishing is still a widespread problem, that affects many
   users worldwide. Although many aspects of phishing have been extensively
   studied in the past, they mainly focus on the execution and prevention
   of different types of phishing and do not consider the process how
   attackers collect the contact information of potential victims. In this
   paper, we analyze the collection process of email addresses in more
   detail. Based on the results of this analysis, we propose email address
   separation as a way for users to detect phishing emails, and reason
   about its effectiveness against several typical types of phishing
   attacks. We find, that email address separation has the potential to
   greatly reduce the perceived authenticity of general phishing emails,
   that target a large amount of users, e.g., by impersonating a popular
   service and spreading malware or links to phishing websites. It is,
   however, not likely to prevent more sophisticated phishing attacks, that
   do not depend on the impersonation of a previously known organization or
   entity. Our results motivate further studies to analyze the usability
   and applicability of the proposed method, and to determine, whether
   address separation has additional positive effects on users' phishing
   awareness or automated phishing detection.},

Abstract = {Nowadays web applications play an important role in online business
   including social networks, online services, banking, shopping, classes,
   email and etc. Ease of use and access to web application make them more
   popular in offering online services instead of in person services. a
   simple user just need a computer and an internet connection to access
   web application and use online services provided by that application.
   There is one core in common between all dynamic web application and that
   is their need to use a database to store information inside that and
   retrieve that information upon the user request or add, edit and delete
   them. Among all database types, rational databases are very popular.
   Most of relational database management systems such as MySQL, Oracle, MS
   SQL Server, MS Access, Postgres use SQL as their language. Flexibility
   of SQL makes it a powerful language. It allows the user to ask what
   information he wants without having any knowledge about how the
   information will be fetch. However vast use of SQL based databases make
   it the center of attention of hackers. SQL injection attack is a
   well-known security threat to database driven web applications. A
   successful SQL injection attack reveals critical confidential
   information to the hacker. In this paper first we provided background
   information on this vulnerability. Next we present a comprehensive
   review of different types of SQL injection attack. For each attack we
   provide an example that shows how the attack launches. Finally we
   propose the best solution at development phase to defeat SQL injection
   and conclusion.},

Title = {Sharing Individual Participant Data from Clinical Trials: An Opinion
   Survey Regarding the Establishment of a Central Repository},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 29},
Abstract = {Background: Calls have been made for increased access to individual
   participant data (IPD) from clinical trials, to ensure that complete
   evidence is available. However, despite the obvious benefits, progress
   towards this is frustratingly slow. In the meantime, many systematic
   reviews have already collected IPD from clinical trials. We propose that
   a central repository for these IPD should be established to ensure that
   these datasets are safeguarded and made available for use by others,
   building on the strengths and advantages of the collaborative groups
   that have been brought together in developing the datasets.
   Objective: Evaluate the level of support, and identify major issues, for
   establishing a central repository of IPD.
   Design: On-line survey with email reminders.
   Participants: 71 reviewers affiliated with the Cochrane Collaboration's
   IPD Meta-analysis Methods Group were invited to participate.
   Results: 30 (42\%) invitees responded: 28 (93\%) had been involved in an
   IPD review and 24 (80\%) had been involved in a randomised trial. 25
   (83\%) agreed that a central repository was a good idea and 25 (83\%)
   agreed that they would provide their IPD for central storage. Several
   benefits of a central repository were noted: safeguarding and
   standardisation of data, increased efficiency of IPD meta-analyses,
   knowledge advancement, and facilitating future clinical, and
   methodological research. The main concerns were gaining permission from
   trial data owners, uncertainty about the purpose of the repository,
   potential resource implications, and increased workload for IPD
   reviewers. Restricted access requiring approval, data security,
   anonymisation of data, and oversight committees were highlighted as
   issues under governance of the repository.
   Conclusion: There is support in this community of IPD reviewers, many of
   whom are also involved in clinical trials, for storing IPD in a central
   repository. Results from this survey are informing further work on
   developing a repository of IPD which is currently underway by our group.},

Abstract = {Smart home security control system has became indispensable in daily
   life. The design and development of a home security system, based on
   human face recognition technology and remotely monitoring technology, to
   confirm visitor identity and to control door accessibility has been
   reported in this paper. This paper describes about the implementation
   and deployment of wireless control system and accessibility in to a home
   environment for authenticated people only. A wireless network technique
   ZigBee based and image processing technique PCA based, dedicatedly make
   the security system alive as per the request. ZigBee module and
   electromagnetic door lock module combinedly operate the door
   accessibility, has been designed and developed. Face detection and
   recognition algorithms, as well as a wireless interface are used to
   detect and identify visitors and send an email and/or an alert message
   about the current home environment status via GSM network automatically
   to the home owner's mobile phone or any communication devices. The
   concerned authority can control the system through his/her mobile phone
   or any communication devices by sending AT Commands to GSM MODEM or by
   taking necessary actions for authentication through email, which is
   again password protected. Users can monitor visitors and control the
   door lock on active Web pages enhanced with JavaScript and HTML. This
   system finds a wide application in areas where physical presence is not
   possible all the time. The entire control system is built using
   ARM1176JZF-S microcontroller and tested for actual use in home
   environment.},

   usability of a private key infrastructure (PKI) email security system
   among clinicians at small family practices. The original security
   intervention involved the clinician's regular machine-based email
   programs, however, early problems resulted mainly from the lack of
   standardization among computer systems. A new approach was designed and
   it involves a web-based security email program. This poster discusses
   the experiences with both approaches to a PKI system.},

Title = {Developing Implementation Strategies to Support the Uptake of a Risk
   Tool to Aid Physicians in the Clinical Management of Patients With
   Syncope: Systematic Theoretical and User-Centered Design Approach},
Journal = {JMIR HUMAN FACTORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Abstract = {Background: The Canadian Syncope Risk Score (CSRS) was developed to
   improve syncope management in emergency department settings.
   Evidence-based tools often fail to have the intended impact because of
   suboptimal uptake or poor implementation.Objective: In this paper, we
   aimed to describe the process of developing evidence-based
   implementation strategies to support the deployment and use of the CSRS
   in real-world emergency department settings to improve syncope
   management among physicians.Methods: We followed a systematic approach
   for intervention development, including identifying who needs to do what
   differently, identifying the barriers and enablers to be addressed, and
   identifying the intervention components and modes of delivery to
   overcome the identified barriers. We used the Behaviour Change Wheel to
   guide the selection of implementation strategies. We engaged CSRS end
   users (ie, emergency medicine physicians) in a user-centered design
   approach to generate and refine strategies. This was achieved over a
   series of 3 qualitative user-centered design workshops lasting 90
   minutes each with 3 groups of emergency medicine physicians. Results: A
   total of 14 physicians participated in the workshops. The themes were
   organized according to the following intervention development steps:
   theme 1-identifying and refining barriers and theme 2-identifying the
   intervention components and modes of delivery. Theme 2 was subdivided
   into two subthemes: (1) generating high-level strategies and developing
   strategies prototypes and (2) refining and testing strategies. The main
   strategies identified to overcome barriers included education in the
   format of meetings, videos, journal clubs, and posters (to address
   uncertainty around when and how to apply the CSRS); the development of a
   web-based calculator and integration into the electronic medical record
   (to address uncertainty in how to apply the CSRS); a local champion (to
   address the lack of team buy-in); and the dissemination of evidence
   summaries and feedback through email communications (to address a lack
   of evidence about impact).Conclusions: The ability of the CSRS to
   effectively improve patient safety and syncope management relies on
   broad buy-in and uptake across physicians. To ensure that the CSRS is
   well positioned for impact, a comprehensive suite of strategies was
   identified to address known barriers.(JMIR Hum Factors 2023;10:e44089)

Abstract = {Due to the popularity and user friendliness of the Internet, numbers of
   users of online social networks (OSNs) and social media have grown
   significantly. However, globally utilised, social networks are the
   consequence of the lack of understanding of secrecy and protection on
   OSN and media has increased. Secrecy and surety of OSNs need to be
   inquired from various positions. According to recent studies, OSN users
   expose their private information such as email address, phone number
   etc. In this paper, we have presented a high-level classification of
   recent OSN attacks for recognising the problem and analysing the blow of
   such attacks on World Wide Web. We have also discussed OSN attacks on
   different social networking web applications by citing certain recent
   reports such as Kaspersky security network and Sophos security threat
   report. We also offer some simple-to-implement user practice tips to
   protect the system and user's information. In addition to this, we have
   discussed a comprehensive analysis of numerous defensive approaches on
   OSN security. Lastly, based on the acknowledged strength and faults of
   these defensive approaches, we have explained open research issues.},

Abstract = {A perennial need for safety in the community depends on country, city,
   and district. In some instances, feeling safe is required on a 24/7
   basis. A popular and cost-effective solution based on the Raspberry Pi
   has the promise of being both user-friendly and cost-effective. It pairs
   the Raspberry Pi to a camera module for face recognition. It learns to
   detect those with granted access to the specified area under protection.
   Such stored faces are the subject of system training. If during
   operation the system recognizes the face in the dataset, then the camera
   shows the matching name with a confidence level possibly granting
   access, but alternatively it takes a photo of the subject and sends it
   as an email notifications warning. The proposed system can implement
   face recognition even from poor quality images performing well over both
   known and unknown datasets. Face recognition leverages techniques from
   the OpenCV library and is written in the Python language.},

Abstract = {In a public key encryption, we may want to enable someone to test
   whether something is a keyword in a given document without leaking
   anything else about the document. An email gateway, for example, may be
   desired to test whether the email contains a keyword ``urgent{''} so
   that it could route the email accordingly, without leaking any content
   to the gateway. This mechanism was referred as public key encryption
   with keyword search {[}4]. Similarly, a user may want to enable an email
   gateway to search keywords conjunctively, such as ``urgent{''} email
   from ``Bob{''} about ``finance{''}, without leaking anything else about
   the email. We refer to this mechanism as public key encryption with
   conjunctive field keyword search. In this paper, we define the security
   model of this mechanism and propose two efficient schemes whose security
   is proved in the random oracle model.},

Abstract = {Aim: Off-label intravitreal injections of bevacizumab (Avastin) have
   been given for the treatment of neovascular and exudative ocular
   diseases since May 2005. Since then, the use of intravitreal bevacizumab
   has spread worldwide, but the drug-related adverse events associated
   with its use have been reported only in a few retrospective reviews. The
   International Intravitreal Bevacizumab Safety Survey was initiated to
   gather timely information regarding adverse events from doctors around
   the world via the internet.
   Methods: An internet-based survey was designed to identify adverse
   events associated with intravitreal bevacizumab treatment. The survey
   web address was disseminated to the international vitreoretinal
   community via email. Rates of adverse events were calculated from
   participant responses.
   Results: 70 centres from 12 countries reported on 7113 injections given
   to 5228 patients. Doctor-reported adverse events included corneal
   abrasion, lens injury, endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, inflammation
   or uveitis, cataract progression, acute vision loss, central retinal
   artery occlusion, subretinal haemorrhage, retinal pigment epithelium
   tears, blood pressure elevation, transient ischaemic attack,
   cerebrovascular accident and death. None of the adverse event rates
   exceeded 0.21\%.
   Conclusion: Intravitreal bevacizumab is being used globally for ocular
   diseases. Self-reporting of adverse events after intravitreal
   bevacizumab injections did not show an increased rate of potential
   drug-related ocular or systemic events. These short-term results suggest
   that intravitreal bevacizumab seems to be safe.},

Abstract = {In this research, we address the over-generalized perspective of
   spam/ham (non-spam) classification. Despite the intricacies of spam
   classification, reliance on user feedback may inadvertently skew filters
   to misclassify legitimate and malicious emails, as users are prone to
   flag innocuous commercial mail as spam rather than unsubscribing.
   Current spam datasets have a propensity to include such user-flagged
   spam which can lead to further misclassification, leading to filters
   biased against warranted commercial correspondence. Motivated to address
   this concern, we introduce two new classification categories that delve
   deeper into the nuances of spam. `Warranted spam', refers to consensual
   communications, from a credible source with transparent and safe opt-out
   mechanisms, and `unwarranted spam' describes unsolicited messages, often
   of a malicious nature. Utilizing these classifications, we propose an
   innovative and dynamic `warranted spam' dataset that seeks to pave the
   way for researchers to develop more sophisticated spam filtering
   techniques. Furthermore, our study delves into pioneering machine
   learning and natural language processing approaches, harnessing our
   dataset's potential. The overarching aspiration of our work is to
   augment online safety, preserve brand integrity, and optimize both the
   user experience and the efficacy of email marketing campaigns.},

Abstract = {User browsing behavior is tracked by search providers in order to
   construct activity profiles that are used to fine-tune searches and
   present user-specific advertisements. When a search input matches a
   commercial product or service offering, ads based on the
   previously-saved interests, likes and dislikes are displayed. The number
   of web searches from mobile devices has exceeded those conducted from
   desktops. Mobile devices are being used for critical business tasks such
   as e-commerce, banking transactions, video conferences, email
   communications and confidential data storage. Companies are moving
   towards mobile-app-only strategies and advertisers are displaying ads on
   mobile apps as well. Mobile device ads can often reveal information such
   as location, gender, age and other valuable data about users. This
   chapter describes a methodology for extracting and analyzing ads on
   mobile devices to retrieve user-specific information, reconstruct a user
   profile and predict user identity. The results show that the methodology
   can identify a user even if he or she uses the same device, multiple
   devices, different networks or follows different usage patterns. The
   methodology can be used to support a digital forensic readiness
   framework for mobile devices. Additionally, it has applications in
   context-based security and proactive and reactive digital forensic

Abstract = {Plain Language Summary Clinical trials can be stressful experiences for
   patients and their caregivers, especially when participants are affected
   by serious diseases. By understanding trial participants' attitudes and
   experiences, researchers may be better able to accommodate their
   interests when designing and conducting research studies. This study
   sought insight into attitudes and experiences of spinal muscular atrophy
   (SMA) clinical trial participants by surveying people who participated
   in SMA clinical trials in the USA. The data used in analysis reflected
   70 unique clinical trial experiences. Survey responses revealed positive
   attitudes about clinical trial management overall. Top motivators for
   trial participation included clinical benefit, investigational drug
   access, and the opportunity to help others. Top concerns were safety,
   whether benefits would justify risks, and concerns about pain
   accompanying tests. The greatest stressors were fear of pain, adverse
   event concerns, and challenges managing medical complications of SMA.
   Top benefits of trial participation were hope for a better future,
   helping others, and relationships with the study team. Whether or not
   specific motivators, concerns, stressors, and benefits were important
   was predicted by participant gender, age, and race, as well as
   respondent type (participant or caregiver), knowledge about SMA,
   distance to the trial site, and treatment era. Top recommendations for
   improving study management all related to receiving more information.
   This research provides new perspective on patient experiences in SMA
   clinical trials, and may be used to inform future study design and
   interactions with research participants.
   Introduction Understanding clinical trial experiences can illuminate
   opportunities to optimize trial design and management, with potential
   benefits for recruitment and retention. This study sought to better
   understand clinical trial participant experiences and attitudes within
   spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and how the evolving treatment landscape
   and participant characteristics may predict attitudes. Methods A survey
   was developed following a review of published literature and discussions
   with caregivers of SMA trial participants. This was distributed via
   email to known trial participants in Cure SMA's database, announcements
   in Cure SMA's newsletter, and emails to SMA clinical trial principal
   investigators. Results Seventy complete surveys reflecting unique
   clinical trial experiences were included in analysis. Responses revealed
   positive attitudes about clinical trial management overall. Top
   motivators for trial participation included clinical benefit,
   investigational drug access, and the opportunity to help others. Top
   concerns were safety, whether benefits would justify risks, and concerns
   about pain accompanying tests. The greatest stressors were fear of pain,
   adverse event concerns, and challenges managing medical complications of
   SMA. Top benefits of trial participation were hope for a better future,
   helping others, and relationships with the study team. In regression
   analysis, participant gender, age, and race all emerged as significant
   predictors (p < 0.05) of motivators, concerns, stressors, and benefits,
   as did respondent type, knowledge about SMA, distance to the trial site,
   and treatment era. Top recommendations for improving study management
   all related to receiving more information. Conclusion This research
   provides new perspective on patient experiences in SMA clinical trials.
   It underscores the importance of information and efforts to anticipate
   and accommodate participant needs. These findings may inform study
   design and interactions with research participants. They may become
   especially important in supporting recruitment and retention as more
   treatment options become available.},

Abstract = {In the evolving landscape of mixed traffic environments, the interaction
   between Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) and Human-driven
   Vehicles (HVs) introduces complex dynamics that challenge traditional
   traffic control paradigms. The Mixed Platoon Hierarchical Control (MPHC)
   model innovatively addresses these dynamics by integrating advanced
   control strategies that optimize the coexistence of CAVs and HVs.
   Specifically, the model introduces two novel approaches: the Incorporate
   Real-time Changes in Dynamic Headway (IRC\_DH), which dynamically
   adjusts CAV headways by utilizing real-time traffic data and road
   conditions, enhancing platoon efficiency and reducing headway by up to
   24.35\%; and the Incorporate Controls to Improve Response Speed
   (IC\_IRS) for HVs, a multi-variable control strategy that considers
   vehicle states, reducing speed differentials by as much as 53.125\%,
   thereby stabilizing platoon dynamics and significantly lowering
   collision risks. These strategies distinguish themselves from existing
   approaches by providing a more precise, adaptable, and robust solution
   to the dynamic challenges of mixed traffic flow, addressing both
   efficiency and safety. Simulation results confirm that these strategies
   significantly improve traffic flow efficiency and safety, providing a
   scalable and adaptable framework for traffic management in mixed
   vehicular environments. This work makes a substantial contribution to
   the field by emphasizing a comprehensive, real-time, and
   multi-dimensional approach to managing mixed traffic environments,
   thereby advancing the state-of-the-art in CAV-HV integration.},

Abstract = {Social Engineering attacks are among the most exploited methods in
   today's cybersecurity threat landscape. Despite the impact and the
   volume of such incidents, there is still a surprising lack of
   comprehensive tools or frameworks offering an in-depth insight into
   Social Engineering attacks. The paper delivers a handy yet comprehensive
   framework for the analysis of the Social Engineering tactics,
   techniques, and procedures (TTPs), distinguishing six major phases of
   the Social Engineering process, together with detailed TTPs linked with
   each of them. In the long-term, it may lead to devising better and more
   effective defense mechanisms against such attacks by providing an
   in-depth insight into the process and methods behind them. The outcome
   presents that framework in the form of a legible, transparent, and
   ready-to-use matrix, similar to the MITRE ATT\&CK matrix. The paper also
   contains a cross-comparison between the proposed framework and the MITRE
   ATT\&CK to underline the added value of the proposed approach. In order
   to demonstrate the practical usefulness of the approach proposed in this
   paper, after formulating the entire framework, we apply it to decompose

Abstract = {Research into the human factors of cyber security is becoming
   increasingly important in helping to understand how human behaviour can
   be influenced in the modern age of human targeted cyber-attacks.
   Phishing is one of the most prevalent methods used to socially engineer
   human targets, and as such it is important to establish which factors
   may influence susceptibility to phishing emails. The majority of
   research has thus far been dedicated to individual level and semantic
   factors of susceptibility, while other important issues such as
   organisational context have been largely absent. This paper explores
   whether industry type influences behaviours resulting from phishing
   simulations. Here we present a large sample of real-world data from
   phishing simulations deployed to employees from banking, education,
   healthcare and pharmaceutical organisations and construction. Analyses
   were conducted across multiple potential responses - opening an email,
   clicking a link, replying to the email, entering data, and reporting the
   email as suspicious. The results revealed significant differences in
   susceptibility to phishing depending on which industry type employees
   belonged to. Consistent with previous work, the banking industry had the
   fewest number of employees engaged in opening phishing emails and
   clicking links. Implications for future work and industry professionals
   are discussed.},

   for Small and Midsize Enterprises: A Comprehensive Analysis},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {28335-28352},
Abstract = {The proliferation of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has
   driven significant innovation but also introduced new security risks,
   particularly in social engineering attacks such as phishing. Despite the
   potential for misuse of GenAI in such attacks, research on its use for
   defense against these threats is limited. To address this issue, this
   study addresses the unique cybersecurity needs of small and midsize
   enterprises (SMEs) by utilizing high-quality email datasets, categorized
   into human and AI-generated phishing and legitimate emails, to evaluate
   the effectiveness of different GenAI models. The results demonstrated
   that the open-source Llama-3-8b-instruct model outperformed other
   alternatives, achieving the highest accuracy and F1-score, while
   offering a cost-effective and flexible solution for SMEs. This approach
   lies in its focus on base models with default parameters, emphasizing
   ease of implementation without the need for additional training or
   fine-tuning. Compared to existing methods, this approach simplifies
   adoption while maintaining robust detection capabilities. The proposed
   prompt template enables LLMs to provide explanations and suggestions,
   assisting users in making informed decisions. Practical recommendations
   for SMEs include deployment strategies and cost-effective management of
   human factors in cybersecurity. However, the study acknowledges
   limitations in its reliance on base models and emphasizes the need for
   further research on fine-tuning and parameter optimization. These
   findings suggest the feasibility of using LLMs for real-world
   cybersecurity applications against phishing attacks in the context of
   SMEs, although certain risks and challenges remain.},

Abstract = {Ever-driven by technological innovation, the Internet of Things (IoT) is
   continuing its exceptional evolution and growth into the common consumer
   space. In the wake of these developments, this paper proposes a
   framework for an IoT home security system that is secure, expandable,
   and accessible. Congruent with the ideals of the IoT, we are proposing a
   system utilizing an ultra-low-power wireless sensor network which would
   interface with a central hub via Bluetooth 4, commonly referred to as
   Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to monitor the home. Additionally, the
   system would interface with an Amazon Echo to accept user voice
   commands. The aforementioned central hub would also act as a web server
   and host an internet accessible configuration page from which users
   could monitor and customize their system. An internet-connected system
   would carry the capability to notify the users of system alarms via SMS
   or email. Finally, this proof of concept is intended to demonstrate
   expandability into other areas of home automation or building monitoring
   functions in general.},

Abstract = {Dynamic and optimal management of radio spectrum congestion is becoming
   a major problem in networking. Various factors can cause damage and
   interference between different users of the same radio spectrum.
   Cognitive radio provides an ideal and balanced solution to these types
   of problems (overload and congestion in the spectrum). The cognitive
   radio concept is based on the flexible use of any available frequency
   band of the radio spectrum that could be detected. In the world of
   cognitive radio, we distinguish two categories of networks, namely the
   primary ones, which have priority and control over access to the radio
   spectrum, and the secondary ones, called cognitive radio networks, which
   allocate the spectrum dynamically. In this paper, we focus on the
   dynamic management of the radio spectrum based on a multi-criteria
   algorithm to ensure the quality of service (QoS) of the utilization by
   secondary users. Our approach is to use a multi-agent system based on
   autonomous learning and focused on a competitive cognitive environment.
   In this paper, we evaluate the secondary user's performance in an ideal
   environment of cognitive radio systems; we use the multi-agent platform
   called Java Agent Development (JADE), in which we implement a program
   that applies the multi-criteria TOPSIS algorithm to choose the best
   primary user (PU) among several PUs detected in the radio spectrum.
   Another paper allows scalability over 100 primary users evaluating four
   different types of technologies, namely voice, email, file transfer and
   video conferencing, and a comparison at the end of the convergence time
   for the latter technology with results from another paper.},

Abstract = {While real-time electricity consumption data of users in smart grids can
   enable value-added services, such as Big Data analytics, each individual
   user's privacy needs to be protected. How to balance data utility and
   privacy protection is a significant issue, of which privacy-preserving
   data aggregation (PPDA) is a viable solution. Prior to this, researchers
   have proposed a number of PPDA schemes to address the above challenge.
   Unluckily, most of them suffer from security and privacy drawbacks,
   while others are inappropriate for resource-limited smart meters due to
   high cost of cryptographic operations. To tackle this issue, in this
   article, we propose a pairing-free and exponentiation-free
   certificateless PPDA scheme named CL-PPDA for smart grids. We prove the
   security of our design and analyze its performance. Comparative analyses
   with state-of-the-art work in theory and experiment show that our design
   not only has better security properties, but also has competitive
   computation overhead, especially on the resource-constrained smart meter
   side. Besides, we present an extension of our CL-PPDA scheme to support
   multidimensional data aggregation, which further enriches the
   functionality of our design.},

Abstract = {The evolution of the Internet has introduced many features such as
   Assortment of Information, Communication, Transaction, Shopping, Social
   Networks, Chats, Advertisements, Online Education, Encyclopedia etc.,
   Although Internet helps to make our life simple and rich, there is a
   dangerous threat to Internet security (Le.) Hacking {[}2]. Especially,
   Electronic communication is an emerging technique where we send
   information from sender to receiver in the form of E-Mail. The basic
   requirement for each user is to have a separate ID known as Mail
   Identity. That ID is used for all purposes specified above. Each user
   can have more than one ID for different mail services including social
   networking. But most of the Mail ID's are not really safe and are easily
   accessible by anyone. Nowadays, most of the mail servers providing Email
   communication for their valuable users. Among the mail servers, some of
   them only have well secured communications. We analyzed some well
   secured mail servers regarding their security based on some unchancy
   hacking techniques. From our analysis, we found some of the loopholes
   are in existing mail servers, which are allowing the hackers, to hack
   the victim's account. In this paper, we described some dangerous
   techniques that are considered as loopholes in the existing mail
   servers. Beyond the loopholes, we analyzed some vulnerabilities from
   existing mail servers. To compromise the loopholes and vulnerabilities,
   we planned to create a new mail server as a solution to block the given
   problems.},

Abstract = {Without enforced standards or reliable third-party verification, food
   safety threats such as pesticide residues and aflatoxin contamination
   are generally unobservable or only partially observable to both buyers
   and sellers, especially of staple foods in rural maize markets in
   sub-Saharan Africa. As a result, sellers have more information about
   food quality than do buyers. Such information asymmetries can impede
   market development and undermine human health. We study farm household
   behaviour in the context of imperfect food safety information. We pool
   observations obtained from 707 food storage containers maintained by 309
   farm households in Benin, surveyed following the maize harvests of
   2011/2012 and 2013/2014. Our results indicate that when a household
   perceives a food safety risk associated with application of
   insecticides, on average it is 33 percentage points less likely to apply
   insecticides to maize it intends to consume than it is to maize it
   intends to sell. These individuals are also more likely to sell maize
   than households without food safety concerns. Results highlight the
   potential value of improved storage technologies and quality control to
   promote market transactions and reduce hidden health risks.},

Abstract = {In the computer world, data security is the main issue. Many attacks and
   techniques are used for stealing data. Instead of considering on
   internet, o ine storage like in hard disk, etc., should also get secured
   enough so that in case of theft, user information should not get
   accessed. Till now, third party software is available for securing but
   they all are easily cracked. For securing hard disk in such a way that
   attacker not get information from device, a small chip will be mounted
   inside the hard disk which is always concatenated with user email and
   always sends location and information of the attached machine. It also
   contains double password security and can also receive message from
   concatenated email for blocking or encrypting the data inside the disk.
   This approach is like using IOT for securing data in hard disk.},

Abstract = {As we know that security is an important issue in distributed system,
   that create many problems when a user want to access, or accessing
   services through the internet then credential management acting a main
   role in enhancing the security of that system, or an organization. In
   this proposed work w provide security solution with the help of Open PGP
   (RFC 4880) certificates in Grid Framework. Open PGP is nothing but it is
   an email encryption standard. In explanation I want to say that X.509
   certificates are issuing by certification authority (CA) that certified
   by multiple companies, it secure by own point of view but when it is
   used distributed Grid system infrastructure then it becomes quite
   unsecure, when updating alert send to admin of the database through
   email then some email attacks may be possible like man in middle attack,
   pretexting, phishing etc. in this propose work we presented a framework
   which uses open PGP to prevents man in middle in the grid computing
   environment and provide robust and secure grid system.},

Abstract = {Order-revealing encryption (ORE) enables the untrusted server to perform
   greater-than-comparison over ciphertext without compromising data
   privacy, which allows anyone to evaluate the lexicographic ordering of
   two arbitrary ciphertexts with a public comparison algorithm. However,
   most ORE constructions merely support ciphertext comparison for
   single-user. Recently, a variant of ORE named delegatable ORE has been
   introduced, which achieves cross-user ciphertext comparison by employing
   token mutual authorization technique at the cost of weak security, i.e.,
   reveals the most significant differing bit of underlying plaintexts. To
   tackle this problem, we first present a deterministic
   property-preserving hash called DPPH with short-size hash value, and
   then propose a novel multi-client ORE scheme (m-ORE) from DPPH that
   supports ciphertext comparison among multiple users while hiding the
   most significant differing bits. Furthermore, we present an enhanced
   construction dubbed m-H-ORE by introducing a two-phase comparison
   method, which can achieve supper-efficient comparison in some cases,
   i.e., two ciphertexts with different bit-length. Finally, we provide
   formal security proofs of the proposed schemes and run extensive
   experiments to evaluate their performance on real-world and synthetic
   datasets. The results demonstrate that both of the proposed schemes can
   achieve a speedup of 47x and 138x in comparison cost to that of
   parameter-hiding ORE, respectively.},

Abstract = {Objective To actively solicit adverse events experienced in the days
   following immunisation with quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine
   using Australia's near real-time, participant-based vaccine safety
   surveillance system, AusVaxSafety.
   Design and setting Observational cohort study conducted in 194 sentinel
   surveillance immunisation sites (primary care, hospital and
   community-based clinics) across Australia.
   Participants Individuals aged >= 6 months who received a routine
   seasonal influenza vaccine at a participating site (n=102 911) and
   responded to a survey (via short message service or email) sent 3 days
   after vaccination about adverse events experienced (n=73 892; 71.8\%).
   Main outcome measure Near real-time and cumulative participant-reported
   rates of any adverse event, fever or medical attendance experienced
   within 3 days after vaccination overall, by brand, age, pregnancy status
   and concomitant vaccine receipt.
   Results Participant median age was 57 years (range: 6 months to 102
   years); 58.1\% (n=42 869) were female and 2.7\% (n=2018) were pregnant.
   Near real-time fast initial response cumulative summation and Bayesian
   analyses of weekly event rates did not demonstrate a safety signal.
   Children aged 6 months to 4 years had higher event rates (522/6180;
   8.4\%) compared with older ages; participants aged >= 65 years reported
   fewer events (1695/28 154; 6.0\%). There were no clinically significant
   differences in safety between brands, by age group or overall.
   Cumulative data analysis demonstrated that concomitant vaccination was
   associated with increased rates of fever (2.1\% vs 0.8\%) and medical
   attendance (0.8\% vs 0.4\%), although all rates were low and did not
   exceed expected levels.
   Conclusions Novel, postmarketing AusVaxSafety surveillance demonstrated
   comparable and expected safety outcomes for the 2017 quadrivalent
   inactivated influenza vaccine brands used in Australia. These near
   real-time, participant-reported data are expected to encourage
   confidence in vaccine safety and promote uptake.},

Abstract = {The security and privacy of encrypted mobile applications have attracted
   the attention of researchers. However, most of the existing researches
   focus on analysis of SSL/TLS traffic, while few studies focus on
   proprietary encrypted traffic, which is also important and challenging.
   In this paper, we make a deep study of WeChat, which is one of the most
   popular social applications in the world with over one billion active
   users. The application uses a proprietary encryption protocol called as
   MMTLS for most of its communications. It is designed based on Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 drafts for both performance and security. We
   explore the fine-grained classification of typical user activities
   inside the MMTLS encrypted channels and compare the MMTLS with the HTTPS
   (e.g. flow duration and packet size), which are jointly used in WeChat.
   It is found that MMTLS is suitable for scenarios of low latency and
   lightweight messaging. With the WeChat traffic collected from different
   platforms (Android, iOS) and devices (Huawei, Samsung, iPhone, iPad,
   etc.) by different users, we classify seven typical activities,
   encrypted by MMTLS protocol such as payment, advertisement click,
   browsing moments and so on. The experimental results show that both of
   the average precision and recall can reach over 92\%. Our work is the
   first to perform classification on this proprietary encrypted protocol
   and understanding the difference between MMTLS and TLS. It is believed
   that the work will benefit the security and privacy of WeChat and other
   proprietary encryption applications.},

Abstract = {With increase in Smartphone users, uses have also increased such as
   email, gaming, internet banking etc. which requires it to always remain

   endeavour in this paper is to explore Smartphone malware and combat
   challenges associated with it. Authors have proposed a novel three layer
   security model which detect and defence against the malware attack in
   network traffic and communication access point. Fine grained channel
   permission system is used to grant the permission to access the Wi-Fi
   access point thus providing security when any communication session
   takes place between Smartphone user and server though SSL handshake
   protocol. It also helps in detection of the interval time between
   packets sent and received which give impetus for threshold value used by

   handling of information and incident prevention and handling. The study
   was conducted among librarians in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. A total
   of 1,217 librarians from the public, special, school and research
   libraries of the three Baltic countries responded to the survey. Pearson
   correlation, average scores and descriptive statistics were used to
   achieve the research objective. The results revealed that Estonian
   librarians are more cyber-aware than their Latvian and Lithuanian
   colleagues, but everyone has their weaknesses. The chosen methodology is
   well suited for assessing the cyber awareness of not only library
   employees but also employees of all memory institutions (archives,

Title = {The Acceptance and Use of Digital Technologies for Self-Reporting
   Medication Safety Events After Care Transitions to Home in Patients With
   Cancer: Survey Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {26},
Month = {MAR 8},
Abstract = {Background: Actively engaging patients with cancer and their families in
   monitoring and reporting medication safety events during care
   transitions is indispensable for achieving optimal patient safety
   outcomes. However, existing patient self -reporting systems often cannot
   address patients' various experiences and concerns regarding medication
   safety over time. In addition, these systems are usually not designed
   for patients' just -in -time reporting. There is a significant knowledge
   gap in understanding the nature, scope, and causes of medication safety
   events after patients' transition back home because of a lack of patient
   engagement in self -monitoring and reporting of safety events. The
   challenges for patients with cancer in adopting digital technologies and
   engaging in self -reporting medication safety events during transitions
   of care have not been fully understood. Objective: We aim to assess
   oncology patients' perceptions of medication and communication safety
   during care transitions and their willingness to use digital
   technologies for self -reporting medication safety events and to
   identify factors associated with their technology acceptance. Methods: A
   cross-sectional survey study was conducted with adult patients with
   breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal cancer (N=204) who had experienced
   care transitions from hospitals or clinics to home in the past 1 year.
   Surveys were conducted via phone, the internet, or email between
   December 2021 and August 2022. Participants' perceptions of medication
   and communication safety and perceived usefulness, ease of use, attitude
   toward use, and intention to use a technology system to report their
   medication safety events from home were assessed as outcomes. Potential
   personal, clinical, and psychosocial factors were analyzed for their
   associations with participants' technology acceptance through bivariate
   correlation analyses and multiple logistic regressions. Results:
   Participants reported strong perceptions of medication and communication
   safety, positively correlated with medication self -management ability
   and patient activation. Although most participants perceived a
   medication safety self -reporting system as useful (158/204, 77.5\%) and
   easy to use (157/204, 77\%), had a positive attitude toward use
   (162/204, 79.4\%), and were willing to use such a system (129/204,
   63.2\%), their technology acceptance was associated with their
   activation levels (odds ratio {[}OR] 1.83, 95\% CI 1.12-2.98), their
   perceptions of communication safety (OR 1.64, 95\% CI 1.08-2.47), and
   whether they could receive feedback after self -reporting (OR 3.27, 95\%
   CI 1.37-7.78). Conclusions: In general, oncology patients were willing
   to use digital technologies to report their medication events after care
   transitions back home because of their high concerns regarding

   Weather Education},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Pages = {2195-2206},
Abstract = {This study introduces an augmented reality (AR) authoring tool tailored
   for flight instructors without technical expertise. While AR offers
   potential in aviation weather education and instructors desire to use it
   in the classroom, they face challenges due to limited digital
   proficiency and complexity of authoring tools. Many existing AR
   authoring tools prioritize technical aspects over user experience. To
   address these challenges, a no-programming-required AR authoring tool
   was developed based on instructor-informed requirements, such as
   incorporating features of flight waypoints and weather phenomena. A
   total of 41 participants tested the tool by crafting three AR learning
   modules. After using the tool, there was a significant increase in
   participants' confidence in AR content creation (+30\%), AR authoring
   process (+51\%), and interactive AR development (+50\%). In addition,
   there was a significant decrease in their concerns about technical
   complexity (-19\%), mental effort (-30\%), and time consumption (-30\%).
   Participants rated the incorporated functions highly preferable and
   indicated the tool has high usability. Participants completed the most
   challenging task quickly and with a low cognitive load. The findings
   demonstrate the tool's effectiveness in enabling participants to
   competently and efficiently author AR content, reducing technical
   concerns. Such tools can facilitate the integration of AR technology
   into the classroom, offering students improved access to interactive 3-D
   visualizations of dynamic subjects, such as aviation weather, which
   require students to mentally visualize weather conditions and understand
   their manifestations.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel method, based on keystroke dynamics,
   to distinguish between fake and truthful personal information written
   via a computer keyboard. Our method does not need any prior knowledge
   about the user who is providing data. To our knowledge, this is the
   first work that associates the typing human behavior with the production
   of lies regarding personal information. Via experimental analysis
   involving 190 subjects, we assess that this method is able to
   distinguish between truth and lies on specific types of autobiographical
   information, with an accuracy higher than 75\%. Specifically, for
   information usually required in online registration forms (e.g., name,
   surname and email), the typing behavior diverged significantly between
   truthful or untruthful answers. According to our results, keystroke
   analysis could have a great potential in detecting the veracity of
   self-declared information, and it could be applied to a large number of
   practical scenarios requiring users to input personal data remotely via
   keyboard.},

Abstract = {Certified e-mail delivery is a quickly emerging field with significant
   legal benefits for e-commerce and e-government. Existing
   service-providers provide individual solutions that rely on a trusted
   third party and are in general limited in their scope and
   interoperability; as a consequence, they are unsuitable for cross-border
   application as required by transnational unions like the EU.
   In contrast to existing service-providers, we present a working system
   for certified email that does not rely on a trusted third party for fair
   non-repudiation of receipt. We achieve fair non-repudiation of receipt
   through a novel protocol that involves splitting an encrypted message
   into a chain of parts, which the addressee gradually acquires,
   generating proof-of-receipt for each individual part. The protocol
   cryptographically prevents the addressee from obtaining the message in
   case they terminate the protocol prematurely.
   The universality of the presented system makes it feasible for
   unobtrusive operation using existing user agents and e-mail providers.
   The system is presented as a proof-ofconcept implementation for the
   open-source Mozilla Thunderbird user agent. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The rise of the Internet and the push for ubiquitous computing has
   brought a proliferation of numerous single method solutions, forcing
   users to remember numerous secret codes, a task that is becoming
   increasingly difficult. On the web, codes are used by publications,
   blogs, webmail, e-commerce sites, and financial institutions. Elsewhere,
   they serve as authentication mechanism for internet service providers
   (ISPs), email servers, local and remote host account, ATM, voicemails
   and so on. Existing textual passwords, token based systems, and other
   methods often do not offer the necessary security standard. Fortunately
   biometric systems that are based on the biological features of the user
   when typing texts are very promising in enhancing the de facto textual
   password. The main objective of this paper is to assess and report on
   the suitability of keystrokes dynamics in protecting access to resources
   when users are typing the different types of password that exist.},

Abstract = {Leaked passwords from data breaches can pose a serious threat if users
   reuse or slightly modify the passwords for other services. With more
   services getting breached today, there is still a lack of a quantitative
   understanding of this risk. In this paper, we perform the first
   large-scale empirical analysis of password reuse and modification
   patterns using a ground-truth dataset of 28.8 million users and their
   61.5 million passwords in 107 services over 8 years. We find that
   password reuse and modification is very common (observed on 52\% of the
   users). Sensitive online services such as shopping websites and email
   services received the most reused and modified passwords. We also
   observe that users would still reuse the already-leaked passwords for
   other online services for years after the initial data breach. Finally,
   to quantify the security risks, we develop a new training-based guessing
   algorithm. We show that more than 16 million password pairs (including
   30\% of the modified passwords) can be cracked within just 10 guesses.},

Abstract = {With the rapid growth of handheld devices in the Internet of Things
   (loT) networks, mobile applications have become ubiquitous in everyday
   life. As technology is developed, so also do the risks and threats
   associated with it - especially in the forthcoming quantum era. Existing
   loT networks, however, lack a quantum-resistant secret key sharing
   scheme to meet confidential message transmission demands in wide-area
   mobile applications. To address this issue, this article proposes a new
   scheme, channel reciprocity (CR), based on quantum key distribution
   (QKD) CR-QKD, accomplishes the secret key sharing goal by combining
   emerging QKD and CR-based key generation (CRKG) techniques. Exploiting
   the laws of quantum physics and wireless channels properties, the
   proposed scheme is able to ensure key secrecy, even against
   computationally unbounded adversaries. Elaborated for a single-user
   case, the basic mechanism is extended into a multi-user case - by
   redesigning a multi-user edge forwarding strategy. In addition, to make
   CR-QKD more practical, some enhancement strategies are studied to reduce
   the time delay, and to improve the secret key generation rate in a
   secure manner. A CR-QKD prototype is demonstrated in a metropolitan area
   network, where secret keys are shared between two remote loT devices
   roughly fifteen kilometers apart. Experimental results have verified
   CR-QKD allows a secret key rate of 424 bits per second, with a
   retransmission rate of 2.1 percent.},

Abstract = {Recent high profile data breaches have highlighted the importance of
   insider threat detection research for cyber security. Anomaly based
   insider detection approaches are generally associated with high false
   positives; thus, there has been increased focus on including prediction
   of user psychology and attack motivations. However, data relating to
   psychological profile and personality trait of employees are challenging
   to collect, and do not generally adequately capture attack motivations
   such as disgruntlement (e.g. towards certain behavior). Therefore, in
   this paper, we demonstrate how one can build a user psychological
   profile based on the sentiment analysis of their network browsing and
   email content. We then evaluate our approach using real-world datasets,
   and the findings suggest that our approach can proactively and
   accurately detect malicious insiders with extreme or negative emotional
   tendencies. This is the first work to build user profile and predict
   insider threats using sentiment analysis of their browsing and email
   content.},

Abstract = {Account security to protect user accounts against sensitive data
   breaches is a major mission for online service providers. Therefore,
   they exert tremendous effort in securing account authentication.
   Although threats from complete outsiders, such as account hijacking for
   monetization, still occur, recent studies have shed light on threats to
   privacy from insiders. This paper sheds light on the latter threats.
   Specifically, we present the first comprehensive study of an attack from
   insiders that identifies the existence of a target's account by using
   the target's email address and insecure login-related messages
   displayed. Such a threat may violate intimates' or acquaintances'
   privacy because the kinds of service accounts a user has implies his/her
   personal preferences or situation. We conducted surveys regarding user
   expectations and behaviors on online services and a measurement study of
   the login-related messages on online services that are considered
   sensitive. We found that over 80\% of participants answered that there
   are sensitive services and that almost all services were vulnerable to
   our attack. Moreover, about half the participants who have sensitive
   services are insecurely registered on them and thus could be potential
   victims. Finally, we make recommendations on the basis of our findings
   for online service providers to improve login-related messages and for
   users to take appropriate defensive actions.},

Title = {Assessing Secure OpenID-Based EAAA Protocol to Prevent MITM and Phishing
   Attacks in Web Apps},
Journal = {CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS \& CONTINUA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {75},

Pages = {4713-4733},
Abstract = {To secure web applications from Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) and phishing
   attacks is a challenging task nowadays. For this purpose,
   authen-tication protocol plays a vital role in web communication which
   securely transfers data from one party to another. This authentication
   works via OpenID, Kerberos, password authentication protocols, etc.
   However, there are still some limitations present in the reported
   security protocols. In this paper, the presented anticipated strategy
   secures both Web-based attacks by leveraging encoded emails and a novel
   password form pattern method. The proposed OpenID-based encrypted
   Email's Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (EAAA) protocol
   ensure security by relying on the email authenticity and a Special
   Secret Encrypted Alphanumeric String (SSEAS). This string is deployed on
   both the relying party and the email server, which is unique and
   trustworthy. The first authentication, OpenID Uniform Resource Locator
   (URL) identity, is performed on the identity provider side. A second
   authentication is carried out by the hidden Email's server side and
   receives a third authentication link. This Email's third SSEAS
   authentication link manages on the relying party (RP). Compared to
   existing cryptographic single sign-on protocols, the EAAA protocol
   ensures that an OpenID URL's identity is secured from MITM and phishing
   attacks. This study manages two attacks such as MITM and phishing
   attacks and gives 339 ms response time which is higher than the already
   reported methods, such as Single Sign-On (SSO) and OpenID. The
   experimental sites were examined by 72 information technology (IT)
   specialists, who found that 88.89\% of respondents successfully
   validated the user authorization provided to them via Email. The
   proposed EAAA protocol minimizes the higher-level risk of MITM and
   phishing attacks in an OpenID-based atmosphere.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The existing literature on young and elderly drivers indicates that they
   have the highest crash risks compared to other age groups of drivers.
   This study improves our understanding of the risk factors contributing
   to young and elderly drivers' elevated crash risk by examining
   self-report data from the E-Survey of Road User's Safety Attitudes
   (ESRA). The primary objective of this study is to compare the attitudes
   and behaviours of young, elderly, and middle-age drivers in Canada, the
   United States, and Europe. The main focus is on the practice of driving
   while distracted by mobile phones and driving while fatigued, as these
   are two dangerous behaviours that demonstrate the impact age may have.
   The analyses consistently showed that there are differences in the
   responses attributable to age. In all regions, drivers aged 18-21 years
   consistently reported higher rates of distracted and fatigued driving
   and higher rates of perceived social and personal acceptability of these
   behaviours than drivers aged 35-54 years. Elderly drivers aged 65+ years
   reported even lower rates of these behaviours and acceptability. Young
   drivers were also the least likely to believe that distraction and
   fatigue are frequent causes of road crashes, while elderly drivers were
   the most likely to believe this. This pattern with respect to age
   repeats in the support for policy measures as well; young drivers are
   least likely to support zero tolerance policies for mobile phone use
   when driving, while elderly drivers are the most likely to support this
   measure. Multivariate logistic regression modeling confirmed that
   elderly drivers were the least likely to engage in the use of mobile
   phones while driving or driving while fatigued. Statistically
   significant results showed that the middle-age group was less likely
   than young drivers to read a text message/email or check social media
   while driving and driving while fatigued. (C) 2020 International

Abstract = {Password based authentication schemes are widely used in our daily life
   when we log into websites. However, there are varieties of problems with
   the simple methods, including susceptibility to unintentional exposure
   via phishing and cross-sites password reuse. We present a novel mobile
   phone based authentication scheme, which intends to provide security and
   usability greater than that of traditional two-factor authentication
   protocols. It contains four parties, i.e. the user, the mobile phone,
   the current computer and the remote server. At first, a user's personal
   device-mobile phone-stores the key token by scanning QR code, which is
   sent from the server after user completes the registration phase.
   Secondly, the current computer can use the Bluetooth device address
   registered in remote server to launch a connection request and then it
   can communicate with the mobile phone via Bluetooth. Thirdly, when user
   wants to log into a website, server would transmit an OTP(One time
   password) to user's mobile phone through the current computer in order
   to verify the user. Finally, our scheme has achieved the mutual
   authentication via Bluetooth. Our scheme only needs lower computation.
   In terms of users' requirements, our scheme provides request about
   changing bind-phone for legal users over the email address registered
   during registration phase. After usability and security analysis, we can
   demonstrate that the new scheme fits for the complicated network
   environment.},

Abstract = {Cyber situational awareness (CSA) is a prerequisite for justified
   decision-making and to maintain cyber security. This becomes
   particularly complex when establishing inter-organizational awareness
   across sectors. For example, computer security incident response teams
   (CSIRTs) and national cyber security centers need to establish CSA among
   countries when coordinating regional cyber incident response. Today's
   state of the art of information sharing across larger numbers of
   organizations is often still the least common denominator in the shape
   of web-based forms and email reports. These are easily applicable by
   almost everyone who wants to report findings even in stressful
   situations. However, these do not prove to be efficient for the
   coordinator that aggregates and merges the data. Therefore, a cyber
   coordination platform using online surveys is proposed. This approach
   uses surveys to collect, aggregate and visualize data in a dashboard to
   support cyber coordination and knowledge management. Furthermore, the
   online surveys are easy to use and respond to and therefore simplify the
   participation of stakeholders. We propose an architecture and implement
   a prototype using popular web application frameworks. The evaluation in
   a user study revealed promising results with respect to increased
   efficiency and decreased resource requirements for establishing
   situational awareness.},

Abstract = {Introduction The health crisis of the last 3 years has revealed the
   weaknesses of the child and family support system based on the
   professional use of digital resources in social agencies. This study
   addresses three aims: to examine the level of professional digital
   competence; to analyze the user profiles in a variety of digital
   resources; and to test the impact of level of competences and user
   profiles on four aspects: professional practice, family satisfaction
   with the services, child and family wellbeing, and family autonomy in
   the exercise of the parenting role.Methods Participants were 148
   practitioners from social agencies who voluntarily responded to an
   online survey with 47 questions.Results and discussion Results showed
   that professionals perceive themselves as more competent in areas of
   information / data management and communication / collaboration than in
   the creation of digital content, security measures, and technical
   problem solving. Websites, email, and instant messaging were the sources
   more frequently used and with higher satisfaction, than structured
   programs, social networks and multimedia content. Variability in the
   user profiles showed three clusters: Cluster 1 Social network user (n =
   13), Cluster 2 Diversified user (n = 75) and Cluster 3 Communicative
   instant user (n = 60). Participants in Cluster 2 compared to those in
   the other clusters were the most proficient on their digital competences
   and acknowledge the positive impact of digital resources on their
   professional practice and the psychological and social wellbeing of
   families. This study points the need for improvement in professionals'
   digital competences in some of the measured areas and the user profile
   of digital resources since both provide benefits on professional
   practice and family autonomy and wellbeing.},

Title = {Vaccination Coverage Against Human Papillomavirus in Female Students in
   Cyprus},
Journal = {CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 8},
Abstract = {Background Human papillomavirus (HPV) has been associated with the
   development of several cancers and cardiovascular diseases in females.
   Nevertheless, there is still poor data on vaccination coverage against
   HPV in several countries, including Cyprus. The main target of the
   present research was to assess the vaccination status of female students
   in Cyprus.Methodology An online survey was conducted via a cloud-based
   short questionnaire on Google Forms. Students with a known email address
   were initially invited via email to complete the survey. The
   questionnaire was distributed to 340 students, aged 18-49 years old, who
   lived in Cyprus (60\% response rate).Results The total vaccination
   coverage was 38.1\%. The mean age of participants was 23.5 (+/- 6.5)
   years. The major reason for non-vaccination was the belief that
   participants were not at risk of serious illness from HPV infection
   (22\%), followed by the reported lack of time to get vaccinated (16\%)
   and inertia (13\%). The students who had information about the safety of
   HPV vaccines from electronic sources of information (television,
   websites, and blogs) had lower vaccination coverage compared to those
   who had received information from alternative sources (primary health
   centers, family doctors, or obstetricians) (relative risk (RR) = 1.923,
   95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.9669-3.825; p = 0.033). No significant
   differences in vaccination rates between participants who were coming
   from schools of health sciences versus those from financial schools (RR
   = 1.082, 95\% CI = 0.7574-1.544; p = 0.3348) were observed.Conclusions
   Public health policy interventions and education on HPV vaccines are
   effective ways to improve the awareness and acceptance rate of HPV
   vaccination among female students and improve the HPV vaccination
   coverage level in Cyprus.},

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Pages = {3720-3733},
Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the physical layer security in the
   reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided cell-free networks. A
   maximum weighted sum secrecy rate problem is formulated by jointly
   optimizing the active beamforming (BF) at the base stations and passive
   BF at the RISs. To handle this non-trivial problem, we adopt the
   alternating optimization to decouple the original problem into two
   sub-ones, which are solved using the semidefinite relaxation and
   continuous convex approximation theory. To decrease the complexity for
   obtaining overall channel state information (CSI), we extend the
   proposed framework to the case that only requires part of the RIS' CSI.
   This is achieved via deliberately discarding the RIS that has a small
   contribution to the user's secrecy rate. Based on this, we formulate a
   mixed integer non-linear programming problem, and the linear conic
   relaxation is used to obtained the solutions. Meanwhile, we also study
   the system performance under the imperfect CSI. Finally, the simulation
   results show that the proposed schemes can obtain a higher secrecy rate
   than the existing ones.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONFLICT \& SECURITY LAW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1, SI},
Pages = {49-67},
Month = {SPR},
Abstract = {This article examines the potential role of national courts in reducing
   the `security gap' in the context of armed conflicts. Judges in
   democratic States assume different roles. They may variously serve as a
   legitimating agent of the State; avoid exercising jurisdiction for
   extra-legal considerations; defer to other branches of the government;
   enforce the law in line with the rule of law ideal; or develop the law
   and introduce forms of ethical judgment that go beyond positive
   application of the law. Identifying the various roles assumed by
   national judiciaries, their institutional limits and interactions with
   the executive offers a useful tool for assessing their potential role in
   advancing human security. In relation to the concept of human security,
   it has been suggested that the distinction between internal and external
   notions of security is becoming increasingly blurred, whereby `internal'
   implies judicial guarantees and human rights based security and
   `external' implies war-based security. In this context, the changing
   roles of national courts in situations of armed conflict that are
   explored in the article could be understood as a method for
   strengthening human security. The analysis of Israeli and US cases
   involving targeted killings suggests that while national courts have
   been largely reluctant to limit government action and have tended to
   apply international law in a selective manner, they have nonetheless
   become increasingly willing to review armed conflict cases, including
   State action beyond its territorial borders.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, everyone is living in a digital world with various of virtual
   experiences and realities, but all of them may eventually cause real
   threats in our real world. Some of these threats have been born together
   with the first electronic mail service. Some of them might be considered
   as really basic and simple, compared to others that were developed and
   advanced in time to adapt themselves for the security defense mechanisms
   of the modern digital world. On a daily basis, more than 238.4 billion
   emails are sent worldwide, which makes more than 2.7 million emails per
   second, and these statistics are only from the publicly visible
   networks. Having that information and considering around 60\% and above
   of all emails as threatening or not legitimate, is more than concerning.
   Unfortunately, even the modern security measures and systems are not
   capable to identify and prevent all the fraudulent content that is
   created and distributed every day. In this paper we will cover the most
   common attack vectors, involving the already mass email infrastructures,
   the required contra measures to minimize the impact over the corporate
   environments and what else should be developed to mitigate the modern
   sophisticated email attacks.},

Abstract = {Communication plays a very important and indeed a crucial part in our
   daily lives. Electronic mail, data transfer, and the development of the
   Internet have changed the way the world communicates. As the Internet
   grows in popularity and therefore also in size, more and more
   transmissions take place, mainly because the technology is more readily
   available and applications have become more user friendly, allowing
   entry to less sophisticated users over a broad spectrum. Intertwined
   herewith, is the significant increase in business related use and
   transmission of critical data, ultimately leading to a significant
   increase in security risks. This has attracted and encouraged the entry
   of common criminals with a high level of computer based skills. Most
   data transfers are mainly text based, not secure and vulnerable to
   various forms of security risks. The open and distributed structure of
   the Internet has caused this major global security problem - for
   businesses and the individual. In the case of an individual, a security
   breach is localised, whereas with businesses the implications are far
   reaching. Leakage of intellectual property, confidential information
   and/or financial information could greatly harm businesses and their
   stakeholders. This presentation looks at a model that uses SSH for
   securing an insecure channel like Internet, whilst integrating smart
   cards for client authentication and encryption and decryption of data.},

Abstract = {Online messaging provides a convenient and effective means of fast
   communication. Along with personal communication it is being used by
   organizations for official communication. Many organizations make use of
   online messaging for exchanging sensitive and secret information.
   Although online messaging is used for legitimate purpose, it can be
   misused by various means. An attacker may masquerade as legitimate user
   by hijacking the connection or by conducting man-in-the-middle attack or
   by obtaining physical access to a user's computer. The reason behind
   masquerade as someone else could be spying, snooping and other malicious
   intentions. Unsupervised Techniques for Forensic Analysis of online
   messages are relatively unexplored area in Authorship Analysis research.
   This paper explores the application of unsupervised techniques for
   authorship Verification problem. The approach is based on comparing the
   similarity between a given unknown documents against the known documents
   using various features so that an unknown document can be classified as
   having been written by the same author. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {Second factor (2FA) or passwordless authentication based on
   notifications pushed to a user's personal device (e.g., a phone) that
   the user can simply approve (or deny) has become widely popular due to
   its convenience. In this paper, we show that the effortlessness of this
   approach gives rise to a fundamental design vulnerability. The
   vulnerability stems from the fact that the notification, as shown to the
   user, is not uniquely bound to the user's login session running through
   the browser, and thus if two notifications are sent around the same time
   (one for the user's session and one for an attacker's session), the user
   may not be able to distinguish between the two, likely ending up
   accepting the notification of the attacker's session. Exploiting this
   vulnerability, we present HIENA1, a simple yet devastating attack
   against such ``one-push{''} 2FA or passwordless schemes, which can allow
   a malicious actor to login soon after the victim user attempts to login
   triggering multiple near-concurrent notifications that seem
   indistinguishable to the user. To further deceive the user into
   accepting the attacker-triggered notification, HIENA can optionally
   spoof/mimic the victim's client machine information (e.g., the city from
   which the victim logs in, by being in the same city) and even issue
   other third-party notifications (e.g., email or social media) for
   obfuscation purposes. In case of 2FA schemes, we assume that the
   attacker knows the victim's password (e.g., obtained via breached
   password databases), a standard methodology to evaluate the security of
   any 2FA scheme. To evaluate the effectiveness of HIENA, we carefully
   designed and ran a human factors lab study where we tested benign and
   adversarial settings mimicking the user interface designs of well-known
   one-push 2FA and passwordless schemes. Our results show that users are
   prone to accepting attacker's notification in HIENA with high rates,
   about 83\% overall and about 99\% upon using spoofed information, which
   is almost similar to the rates of acceptance of benign login sessions.
   Even for the non-spoofed sessions (our primary attack), the attack
   success rates are about 68\%, which go up to about 90-97\% if the attack
   attempt is repeated 2-3 times. While we did not see a statistically
   significant effect of using third-party notifications on attack success
   rate, in real-life, the use of such obfuscation can be quite effective
   as users may only see one single 2FA notification (corresponding to
   attacker's session) on top of the notifications list which is most
   likely to be accepted.
   We have verified that many widely deployed one-push 2FA schemes (e.g.,
   Duo Push, Authy OneTouch, LastPass, Facebook's and OpenOTP) seem
   directly vulnerable to our attack.},

Title = {It's the deceiver and the receiver: Individual differences in phishing
   susceptibility and false positives with item profiling},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {13},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 26},
Abstract = {Phishing email is one of the biggest risks to online information
   security due to its ability to exploit human trust and naivety. Prior
   research has examined whether some people are more susceptible to
   phishing than others and what characteristics may predict this
   susceptibility. Given that there are no standardised measures or
   methodologies to detect phishing susceptibility, results have
   conflicted. To address this issue, the current study created a 40-item
   phishing detection task to measure both cognitive and behavioural
   indicators of phishing susceptibility and false positives (misjudged
   genuine email). The task is based on current real-life email stimuli
   (i.e., phishing and genuine) relevant to the student and general
   population. Extending previous literature we also designed a methodology
   for assessing phishing susceptibility by allowing participants to
   indicate perception of maliciousness of each email type and the actions
   they would take (keep it, trash it or seek further information). This
   enabled us to: (1) examine the relationships that psychological
   variables share with phishing susceptibility and false positives-both
   captured as consistent tendencies; (2) determine the relationships
   between perceptions of maliciousness with behavioural outcomes and
   psychological variables; and (3) determine the relationships between
   these tendencies and email characteristics. In our study, 150
   undergraduate psychology students participated in exchange for partial
   course credit (98 Females; Mean age = 19.70, SD = 2.27). Participants
   also completed a comprehensive battery of psychometric tests assessing
   intelligence, pre- and on-task confidence, Big 6 personality, and
   familiarity/competence in computing and phishing. Results revealed that
   people showed distinct and robust tendencies for phishing susceptibility
   and false positives. A series of regression analyses looking at the
   accuracy of both phishing and false positives detection revealed that
   human-centred variables accounted for a good degree of variance in
   phishing susceptibility (about 54\%), with perceptions of maliciousness,
   intelligence, knowledge of phishing, and on-task confidence contributing
   significantly, directly and/or indirectly via perception of
   maliciousness. A regression model looking at discriminating false
   positives has also shown that human-centred variables accounted for a
   reasonable degree of variance (41\%), with perceptions of maliciousness,
   intelligence and on-task confidence contributing significantly, directly
   and/or indirectly via perception of maliciousness. Furthermore, the
   characteristics of the most effective phishing and misjudged genuine
   email items were profiled. Based on our findings, we suggest that future
   research should investigate these significant variables in more detail.
   We also recommend that future research should capture consistent
   response tendencies to determine vulnerability to phishing and false
   positives (rather than a one off response to a single email), and use
   the collection of the most current phishing email obtained from relevant
   sources to the population. It is important to capture perceptions of
   maliciousness of email because it is a key predictor of the action taken
   on the email. It directly predicts accuracy detection of phishing and
   genuine email, as well as mediating the relationships between some other
   predictors whose role would have been overlooked if the perceptions were
   not captured.
   The study provides the framework of human-centred variables which
   predict phishing and false positive susceptibility as well as the
   characteristics of email which most deceive people.},

Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {144},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Cybersecurity vulnerability ranks among the foremost global business
   risks. Phishing attempts, in particular through email, persistently
   challenge organizations despite substantial investments in IT security
   and awareness training. Recognizing the limitations of unilateral
   technology- or human-centered approaches, this study explores how visual
   risk indication can support employees in detecting phishing attempts. To
   do so, we conducted an eyetracking lab experiment in which participants
   rated the trustworthiness of emails with varying levels of credibility.
   Our analysis focuses on human information processing in identifying
   phishing attempts, indicating that the availability of a visual risk
   indicator can significantly influence trust and response behavior,
   without incapacitating implicit phishing cues (such as conspicuous
   senders or anonymous recipients). Our findings suggest that
   organizations should appropriately calibrate visual risk indicators to
   achieve the intended guiding effects. However, the calibration remains a
   trade-off and depends on the organization's environment. We discuss
   implications for integrative cybersecurity approaches to mitigate
   phishing attempts more effectively.},

Abstract = {Phishing attacks pose serious challenges to users, commercial
   institutions and governments alike including identity theft, companies
   and government secrets. The weakest link in any computer security system
   is the people and the success of phishing attacks is substantially based
   on manipulating human emotions. Therefore, we cannot solely rely on
   humans to detect phishing attacks as phishing attacks are becoming more
   and more sophisticated and can bypass filters set by anti-phishing
   techniques. More effective and automatic phishing detection mechanisms
   are required and many detectors have been proposed. However, the high
   number of phishing emails and attacks urges additional efforts. In this
   study, the effectiveness of word embedding in classifying phishing
   emails is investigated. Pre-trained transformer model BERT
   (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is fine-tuned
   to execute the task of classifying emails into phishing and
   non-phishing. The results show that transformer technology is accurate
   enough to improve phishing emails detection and can complement existing
   classifiers.},

Abstract = {In recent years, Online Social Networks (OSN) have become an integral
   part of human society. OSN has become an important and crucial mode of
   interaction among people around the world. For the past two decades, the
   need for data privacy security among the participants of an OSN has been
   challenged as technological advances have provided a lot of benefits and
   exposure to all active members sharing content in various online
   communities. Large amounts of data are usually stored on different
   network nodes, which can lead to malicious data security and privacy
   issues. When OSN users share any private content with the other
   participants of same network like with their friends and colleagues,
   their information may be inadvertently leaked to various other
   individuals to whom it is not supposed to be shared. Those individuals
   may include one's enemies, social robots, and users with fake
   credentials, spammers or data cutters. In addition, the spread of
   malicious through OSN can lead to massive damage to the network and
   privacy leakage. To overcome this problem, we propose a hybrid soft
   computing with big data analytics based protection and recovery strategy
   (HSBD-PR) for security enhancement in large scale OSNs. First, we
   introduce a modified teaching-learning with fish swarm optimization
   (MTL-FS) technique to classify the abnormal network users as five
   classes are susceptive, contagious, doubt, immune and recoverable users.
   Second, we fuse a block window optimization with Bayesian belief network
   (BWB2) for analyze the propagation mechanism of abnormal users in
   network. After that, deep belief neural network (DBNN) based protection
   and recovery strategy is developed to improve the immunity of abnormal
   users and reduce the count of it. Finally, the performance of proposed
   HSBD-PR approach evaluate by standard benchmark datasets is Enron email,
   Epinions and Facebook. The results of this proposed method are compared
   with the existing state-of-art methods in terms of different performance
   metrics are detection failure rate, detection success rate, marginal
   detection gain and detection accuracy respectively.(c) 2022 Published by

   Re-Encryption Scheme for Securing Group Message},

Abstract = {Puncturable proxy re-encryption (PPRE) is envisioned to provide secure
   access control delegation and fine-grained forward security for
   asynchronous group messaging systems. Nevertheless, the existing PPRE
   scheme not only suffers from the burden of certificate management but
   also merely achieves selective security based on the nonstandard
   assumption. In this article, a puncturable identity-based PRE (P-IB-PRE)
   scheme is proposed to efficiently protect the security and privacy of
   the group message. The proposed scheme introduces a message server as
   the proxy to transform ciphertext for each participant in the group;
   thus, the heavy computation overhead is delegated to the message server
   with abundant resources. Most importantly, our scheme enables the
   recipient to revoke its private key's decryption capability of the
   specific messages without affecting other messages. Moreover, the
   identity-based mechanism eliminates the burden of certificate management
   as well as improves efficiency. The proposed scheme achieves adaptive
   security under the standard decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH)
   assumption. Eventually, theoretical and experimental analyses
   demonstrate that the proposed scheme has an excellent performance in
   efficiency and practicality.},

Abstract = {In this era of silicon age, the internet services have become an
   indispensable part of human life. People moving fast towards the
   digitized world and sending an information have never been much easier
   from the onset of file transfer applications, cloud-based applications,
   messengers and email services. Big companies and startups prefer
   cloud-based software solutions due to its accessibility, security and
   easy sharing features. Unfortunately, ``Where there are rivers, there
   are potholes{''}. Crackers and unethical hackers exist in the
   environment, who make this digitization a `nightmare' for newcomers and
   existing users. Millions of security breaches have occurred in decades
   in which few of them are highly severe. The hackers stole highly
   sensitive information such as personal and official. And this incident
   left with millions of information at risk of spamming, phishing attacks
   and etc. The proposed approach focuses the transferring file securely
   (TranSecure) from the authenticated user. Therefore there requires
   features for encrypting the data such that even if it is stolen it will
   be indecipherable. Thus the user's privacy is still satisfied. This
   demand brings out the idea of the approach which securely transmits data
   between users along with first in class encryption and compression for
   security and storage space conservation respectively.},

Abstract = {Security and authentication are ubiquitous problems that impact all
   modern networked systems. Password-based authentication systems are
   still prevalent, and information leaked via other channels may be used
   to attack networked systems. Researchers have previously used email
   addresses as an identifier in leaked data breach information to
   understand password reuse and behaviours, but this has its limitations.
   In this work, we explore the use of passwords themselves as identifiers
   in linking accounts together to provide an alternative view of
   large-scale reuse. We filter for high entropy passwords on the
   Compilation of Many Breaches (COMB) data set, which contains 3.2 billion
   email/password combinations. Using this approach, we find that passwords
   are reused 13 times on average, with a username reuse rate of 66.7\%
   (compared to 40\% when considering emails mergers). We identify that
   potentially malicious actors are engaging in large-scale email and
   password generation and reuse, which also appears to be prominent on
   social media.},

Abstract = {Online surveys using crowdsourcing services have been widely adopted in
   academic research projects aimed at understanding human perception and
   behavior. Because there is a concern that online surveys may include
   dishonest or careless responses by crowdworkers who perform a large
   number of tasks, or responses by bots, several screening methods have
   been proposed to discard such low-quality responses. However, in
   security research, especially in phishing research where the attention
   of participants is considered to influence the results, the elimination
   of careless responses may lead to the removal of participants who should
   be included in the research. In this study, we address the following
   research question: ``Does the adoption of existing screening methods
   bias the results of security surveys?{''} Using Amazon Mechanical Turk
   and Prolific Academic, two popular crowdsourcing platforms used in
   online surveys, we conducted online user studies (N = 600) on security
   knowledge, security behavior, and phishing email detection performance
   to elucidate the influence of screening methods on the results. The
   obtained results indicate that the adoption of the instructional
   manipulation check (IMC) screening method triggers bias in the
   demographics of the participants, as well as differences in the results
   of phishing email detection performance. In addition, the degree of
   these differences depends on the crowdsourcing platform. We also
   demonstrated that it is non-trivial to determine the correlation between
   screening methods and factors that can influence the results of a survey
   on security behavior. These findings suggest that caution should be
   exercised when applying screening methods such as attention checks and
   IMC in studies where the extent of user attention could have a
   significant impact on the results.},

Abstract = {Electronic and internet-based tools for patient-provider communication
   are becoming the standard of care, but disparities exist in their
   adoption among patients. The reasons for these disparities are unclear,
   and few studies have looked at the potential communication technologies
   have to benefit vulnerable patient populations.
   To characterize access to, interest in, and attitudes toward
   internet-based communication in an ethnically, economically, and
   linguistically diverse group of patients from a large urban safety net
   clinic network.
   Observational, cross-sectional study
   Adult patients (a parts per thousand yen 18 years) in six
   resource-limited community clinics in the San Francisco Department of
   Public Health (SFDPH)
   Current email use, interest in communicating electronically with health
   care professionals, barriers to and facilitators of electronic
   health-related communication, and demographic data-all self-reported via
   survey.
   Sixty percent of patients used email, 71 \% were interested in using
   electronic communication with health care providers, and 19 \% reported
   currently using email informally with these providers for health care.
   Those already using any email were more likely to express interest in
   using it for health matters. Most patients agreed electronic
   communication would improve clinic efficiency and overall communication
   with clinicians.
   A significant majority of safety net patients currently use email, text
   messaging, and the internet, and they expressed an interest in using
   these tools for electronic communication with their medical providers.
   This interest is currently unmet within safety net clinics that do not
   offer a patient portal or secure messaging. Tools such as email
   encounters and electronic patient portals should be implemented and
   supported to a greater extent in resource-poor settings, but this will
   require tailoring these tools to patients' language, literacy level, and
   experience with communication technology.},

Abstract = {Phishing is an attack where the attacker creates the fake object
   (e-mail, web site, etc) to fool an online user into eliciting personal
   information. This is a base for a big variety of other security attacks
   as during this social engineering attack user provides sensitive
   personal information. In order to protect against phishing attacks a
   variety of tools are proposed; however, the majority agrees that the
   best countermeasure is user training and education rather than hardware
   or software solutions. In this paper, we analyze how credulous to
   phishing attacks are educated persons (people with no less than bachelor
   degree). The real-world study was executed to inspect how personnel of
   higher education organization react to phishing email, how credulous,
   suspicious they are and how far they will go in revealing their personal

Abstract = {Phishing emails typically attempt to persuade recipients to reveal
   private or confidential information (e.g., passwords or bank details).
   Interaction with such emails places individuals at risk of financial
   loss and identity theft. We present an ongoing study using eye tracking
   metrics and varying interface components to assess users' ability to
   spot simulated phishing attempts. Findings seek to establish how users
   interact with email inbox interfaces and will inform future design of
   usable security tools.},

Abstract = {the internet these days plays an important role in our daily lives, as
   the number of web services are increasing such as search engines and
   email, they are threatened by different types of attacks from computer
   programs such as robots. In order to solve this problem, CAPTCHA
   (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans
   Apart) was implemented to be used as a base to distinguish between human
   users and computer bots. Although this technique limits the automatic
   registration to web services to provide security but, still some
   CAPTCHAs have several weaknesses which allow the computer bots to
   infiltrate the mechanism of the CAPTCHA. The aim of this paper is to
   search for the problems in the existing types of CAPTCHA systems and to
   provide solutions or alternative approaches to solve these problem.},

Abstract = {Low intensity transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) in humans,
   encompassing transcranial direct current (tDCS), transcutaneous spinal
   Direct Current Stimulation (tsDCS), transcranial alternating current
   (tACS), and transcranial random noise (tRNS) stimulation or their
   combinations, appears to be safe. No serious adverse events (SAES) have
   been reported so far in over 18,000 sessions administered to healthy
   subjects, neurological and psychiatric patients, as summarized here.
   Moderate adverse events (AEs), as defined by the necessity to intervene,
   are rare, and include skin burns with tDCS due to suboptimal
   electrode-skin contact. Very rarely mania or hypomania was induced in
   patients with depression (11 documented cases), yet a causal
   relationship is difficult to prove because of the low incidence rate and
   limited numbers of subjects in controlled trials. Mild AEs (MAEs)
   include headache and fatigue following stimulation as well as prickling
   and burning sensations occurring during tDCS at peak-to-baseline
   intensities of 1-2 mA and during tACS at higher peak-to-peak intensities
   above 2 mA.\& para;\& para;The prevalence of published AEs is different
   in studies specifically assessing AEs vs. those not assessing them,
   being higher in the former. AEs are frequently reported by individuals
   receiving placebo stimulation. The profile of AEs in terms of frequency,
   magnitude and type is comparable in healthy and clinical populations,
   and this is also the case for more vulnerable populations, such as
   children, elderly persons, or pregnant women. Combined interventions
   (e.g., co-application of drugs, electrophysiological measurements,
   neuroimaging) were not associated with further safety issues.\& para;\&
   para;Safety is established for low-intensity `conventional' TES defined
   as <4 mA, up to 60 min duration per day. Animal studies and modeling
   evidence indicate that brain injury could occur at predicted current
   densities in the brain of 6.3-13 Afin(2) that are over an order of
   magnitude above those produced by tDCS in humans. Using AC stimulation
   fewer AEs were reported compared to DC. In specific paradigms with
   amplitudes of up to 10 mA, frequencies in the kHz range appear to be
   safe.\& para;\& para;In this paper we provide structured interviews and
   recommend their use in future controlled studies, in particular when
   trying to extend the parameters applied. We also discuss recent
   regulatory issues, reporting practices and ethical issues. These
   recommendations achieved consensus in a meeting, which took place in
   Gottingen, Germany, on September 6-7, 2016 and were refined thereafter
   by email correspondence. (C) 2017 International Federation of Clinical

Title = {Comprehensive Feedback on User Experiences With Brain Injury
   Identification Cards},
Journal = {REHABILITATION PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 3},
Abstract = {Purpose/Objective: Brain injuries are often ``invisible{''} injuries
   that can have lifelong consequences including changes in identity,
   functional independence, relationships, and reduced participation in
   daily activities. Survivors of brain injury experience stigma and
   challenges related to the misattribution of symptoms to other causes
   that are significant barriers to recovery and adjustment. Changes in
   policy and other large-scale interventions are cited as an
   underexplored, yet critical path to reducing the impact of brain injury.
   The present study sought to comprehensively characterize the impact of
   one such initiative-Brain Injury Identification Cards-among survivors to
   further refine the resource. Research Method/Design: In this
   cross-sectional qualitative focus group study, we recruited 16
   individuals with a history of brain injury via email listservs of
   individuals who registered for a Brain Injury Identification Card. We
   used rapid data analysis with a hybrid of deductive and inductive
   analytic strategies to identify themes within a priori domains. Results:
   We extracted themes within four domains: (a) process and reasons for
   obtaining cards; (b) overall impressions of the cards; (c) uses of the
   cards; and (d) feedback and proposed changes. Participants described the
   process of obtaining cards as straightforward and shared wide-ranging
   benefits across domains, including improving survivors' sense of safety,
   self-advocacy, and ability to participate in daily activities.
   Conclusions/Implications: Findings highlight the utility of Brain Injury
   Identification Cards for improving community understanding of brain
   injury symptoms and how injury-related challenges may manifest in daily
   life.},

   applications have emerged as a powerful integrated technology,
   showcasing remarkable results in many domains with numerous advantages.
   However, this technology encounters several challenges, and security is
   one of them. Given that, authentication and verification of legitimate
   devices with data privacy pose key concerns in a wireless communication
   environment. Even though, the literature highlights the growing security
   threats of this technology, where attackers can easily compromise the
   existing authentication and data preservation schemes. Therefore, it is
   crucial for all involved stakeholders to address these concerns using
   Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL),
   and Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms, as they offer cost-effective
   solutions. While some algorithms have been used in the literature to
   accurately and effectively predict, detect, and prevent vulnerabilities
   in this technology, they may not adequately handle modern or advanced
   security threats. Therefore, in this article, we provide a comprehensive
   survey of the existing literature from 2014 to 2022, specifically
   focusing on AI, ML, DL, and RL-enabled prototypes. Our goal is to
   highlight the contributions and limitations of the considered articles.
   Based on our observations, we will emphasize on the open challenges to
   set the stage for future research to enhance the security of this
   emerging technology. Moreover, to bridge this gap of all aspects of this
   technology, we will discuss layer-wise security threats and
   countermeasure schemes following the TCP/IP stack. Finally, we will
   compare our work with existing review articles to demonstrate its
   novelty, uniqueness, and potential usefulness for the people working in
   this field.},

Abstract = {The initiation of Online Social Networks (OSN) has distorted a shared
   passive reader into an information provider. The Social Networks (SN)
   utilization of media in long-range interpersonal communication in our
   community is progressively getting to be well known. A victim of a
   winning attack is in which data including user names, email addresses,
   session tokens, and encoded/salted secret phrase of users undermined in
   a Twitter. It helps the users to share knowledge and to exchange
   viewpoints, and also to represent themselves in interactive online
   communities and to connect other users with common interests. OSN has
   transformed users' social domain into commercial space. It generates a
   problem around privacy and protection for OSN users. The OSN service
   providers store their consumers' private and confidential data securely,
   and sometimes it may be misused by data administrators, third parties,
   or unauthorized users. In this article, the trend of social networking
   websites aims to review and analyse these types of cyber threats of SN
   and develop measures to shield the identity in cyberspace, i.e., the
   security of non-public data and identity in social networks is studied.
   Specific protection and privacy concerns are clarified along with the
   guidelines for OSN users to defend themselves against these problems
   while utilizing SN. And this paper proposed a new method over the design
   of the multi-Dimensional Clustering (m-DC) method for FB-Friends, which
   characterize the weight esteems which utilize the assessments of
   inactive and dynamic user attacks. The better percentages of using m-DC
   for Face book users are achieved 45.64\% in the precision, recall, and
   F1 score as 51.15\%, 45.8 \%, 59.19 \%.},

Abstract = {Researchers reveal that personal computers are not exclusively liable to
   attacks. Mobile devices have become the very best target due to the fact
   that, they are largely accustomed to performing numerous activities.
   Email communication, sending and receiving text messages, installation
   of monetary applications (apps) such as mobile banking apps and Bring
   Your Own Device (BYOD) adoption in enterprises for work-related
   functions are among others. Literature review establishes that attackers
   of mobile devices gather sensitive user and enterprise data, which they
   use for blackmailing or for amerceable monetary gains. As the subsequent
   result of mobile app protection and Android vulnerability concerns,
   researchers and practitioners are evaluating the impact the security of
   android mobile device has on enterprise and personal data. This paper
   reviews the extent of data leakage through android devices in a BYOD
   enabled environment, android application security model and BYOD
   benefits and risks using desktop review as the methodology.},

Abstract = {With so much of our lives digital, online, and not entirely under our
   control, we risk losing access to our communications, reputation, and
   data. Recent years have brought a rash of high-profile account
   compromises, but account hijacking is not limited to high-profile
   accounts. In this paper, we report results of a survey about people's
   experiences with and attitudes toward account hijacking. The problem is
   widespread; 30\% of our 294 participants had an email or social
   networking account accessed by an unauthorized party. Five themes
   emerged from our results: (1) compromised accounts are often valuable to
   victims, (2) attackers are mostly unknown, but sometimes known, to
   victims, (3) users acknowledge some responsibility for keeping their
   accounts secure, (4) users' understanding of important security measures
   is incomplete, and (5) harm from account hijacking is concrete and
   emotional. We discuss implications for designing security mechanisms to
   improve chances for user adoption.},

Abstract = {It is very common for people to forget their passwords and request to
   reset their password through web browsers. This leads to the critical
   question of how a software developer should simply and safely, store and
   change a user's password for a web application. When an application
   stores a user's password in a database, the password must be encrypted
   so nobody can query the fields and see the original value. It is bad
   design to send or display the original password to the user when a user
   resets their password, as the information could be seen or intercepted.
   On the other hand, it is also inconvenient that users must memorize
   additional information in the form of security questions when attempting
   to reset the password. When resetting a password, it is better to use a
   user's basic personal information and email or text them a reset URL
   link with encrypted codes. This paper presents an integrated mechanism
   that utilizes PHP and MySQL functions to reset user passwords and
   improve the security for resetting passwords. The method can also
   protect the database from being attacked by reducing unnecessary access
   to the database. A case study is discussed in this paper.},

Abstract = {Objectives To determine acceptability and feasibility of a quality
   improvement (QI) collaborative in safety net dental practices, and
   evaluate its effects on financial stability, access, efficiency, and
   care for pregnant women and young children. Methods Five safety net
   dental practices participated in a 15-month learning collaborative
   utilizing business assessments, QI training, early childhood oral health
   training, and prenatal oral health training. Practices collected monthly
   data on: net revenue, no-show rates, total encounters, and number of
   encounters for young children and pregnant women. We analyzed
   quantitative data using paired t-tests before and after the
   collaborative and collected supplemental qualitative feedback from
   clinic staff through focus groups and directed email. Results All mean
   measures improved, including: higher monthly revenue (\$28,380-\$33,102,
   p = 0.37), decreased no-show rate (17.7-14.3\%, p = 0.11), higher
   monthly dental health encounters (283-328, p = 0.08), and higher monthly
   encounters for young children (8.8-10.5, p = 0.65), and pregnant women
   (2.8-9.7, p = 0.29). Results varied by practice, with some demonstrating
   largest increases in encounters for young children and others pregnant
   women. Focus group participants reported that the collaborative improved
   access for pregnant women and young children, and that QI methods were
   often new and difficult. Conclusion for practice Participation by safety
   net dental practices in a QI collaborative is feasible and acceptable.
   Individual sites saw greater improvements in different outcomes areas,
   based on their own structures and needs. Future efforts should focus on
   specific needs of each dental practice and should offer additional QI
   training.},

   based on ECC is proposed first, which can be used in the following email
   service scenarios: Alice can delegate her decryption rights to Bob for
   an encrypted mails sent to her, which contains a specific word and
   satisfies the condition set on the proxy by Alice, and Bob also can
   delegate the right to others just like Alice through the proxy, as the
   condition set by him is satisfied, and so on if required. Furthermore,
   as an important part for fulfilling our main goal, a new method to
   generate the partial re-encryption keys is proposed, and the security of
   our scheme is proven secure against chosen ciphertext attacks based on
   the random oracle model.},

Abstract = {Modern cities represent one of the fastest growing ecosystems on the
   planet. Urbanization occurs in stages; each stage characterized by a
   distinct habitat that may be more or less susceptible to the
   establishment of disease vector populations and the transmission of
   vector-borne pathogens. We performed longitudinal entomological and
   epidemiological surveys in households along a 1900 x 125 m transect of
   Arequipa, Peru, a major city of nearly one million inhabitants, in which
   the transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi, the aetiological agent of Chagas
   disease, by the insect vector Triatoma infestans, is an ongoing problem.
   The transect spans a cline of urban development from established
   communities to land invasions. We find that the vector is tracking the
   development of the city, and the parasite, in turn, is tracking the
   dispersal of the vector. New urbanizations are free of vector
   infestation for decades. T. cruzi transmission is very recent and
   concentrated in more established communities. The increase in land
   tenure security during the course of urbanization, if not accompanied by
   reasonable and enforceable zoning codes, initiates an influx of
   construction materials, people and animals that creates fertile
   conditions for epidemics of some vector-borne diseases.},

Abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into Multimodal Large Language
   Models (MLLMs), significantly enhancing their capabilities by
   integrating visual information and other types, thus aligning more
   closely with the nature of human intelligence, which processes a variety
   of data forms beyond just text. Despite advancements, the undesirable
   generation of these models remains a critical concern, particularly due
   to vulnerabilities exposed by text-based jailbreak attacks, which have
   represented a significant threat by challenging existing safety
   protocols. Motivated by the unique security risks posed by the
   integration of new and old modalities for MLLMs, we propose a unified
   multimodal universal jailbreak attack framework that leverages iterative
   image-text interactions and transfer-based strategy to generate a
   universal adversarial suffix and image. Our work not only highlights the
   interaction of image-text modalities can be used as a critical
   vulnerability but also validates that multimodal universal jailbreak
   attacks can bring higher-quality undesirable generations across
   different MLLMs. We evaluate the undesirable context generation of MLLMs
   like LLaVA, Yi-VL, MiniGPT4, MiniGPT-v2, and InstructBLIP, and reveal
   significant multimodal safety alignment issues, highlighting the
   inadequacy of current safety mechanisms against sophisticated multimodal
   attacks. This study underscores the urgent need for robust safety
   measures in MLLMs, advocating for a comprehensive review and enhancement
   of security protocols to mitigate potential risks associated with
   multimodal capabilities.},

Abstract = {The idea of attending a professor's office hours seems very basic to the
   average college student. The beginning of each semester brings about a
   wave of invitations to visit each professor in their office, at the
   allotted time for the section of their class. Recent developments such
   as the growing prevalence of texting and email, as well as specific
   events such as the Covid-19 pandemic have brought the norm away from
   these in person meetings between students and professors, to the
   detriment of the students' education. The SmArt WhiteBoard Replacement
   Interactive Device (SAWBRID) is an innovative solution composed of an
   interactive device with a Low-power screen that, through a user friendly
   mobile application, makes the facilitation of office hours and the
   student/professor interactions outside of the classroom far more
   flexible and simple. In whole, the project is centered around the
   individual professor, their schedule, and how that schedule is
   communicated. The SAWBRID sits in an accessible casing outside of the
   professor's office, relaying information about their schedule, available
   time slots to be scheduled through the mobile application, and
   personalized messages. The device is self-updating whenever a change is
   detected in the professor's schedule, or when they decide to update
   their personalized message. The student can access a professor's
   schedule through the mobile application and schedule an appointment,
   which will place their initials in the selected time slot on both the
   mobile application and the SAWBRID. The professor has a different
   interface to interact with their SAWBRID from the mobile application
   giving them more control over their schedule, the personalized messages
   they want to display and other features. We use security services such
   as confidentiality and authentication throughout the system to protect
   user credentials, user data, and to ensure the privacy of the users. Our
   solution effectiveness and performance are evaluated through power
   measurements to determine the device's ability to self-sustain for long
   periods of time and the ease of use.},

Abstract = {Objective It is unknown how hospital- and systems-level factors have
   impacted patient safety in the intensive care unit (ICU) during the
   COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to understand how the pandemic has
   exacerbated preexisting patient safety issues and created novel patient
   safety challenges in ICUs in the United States. Method We performed a
   national, multi-institutional, mixed-methods survey of critical care
   clinicians to elicit experiences related to patient safety during the
   pandemic. The survey was disseminated via email through the Society of
   Critical Care Medicine listserv. Data were reported as valid
   percentages, compared by COVID caseload and peak of the pandemic;
   free-text responses were analyzed and coded for themes. Results We
   received 335 survey responses. On general patient safety, 61\% felt that
   conditions were more hazardous when compared with the prepandemic
   period. Those who took care of mostly COVID-19 patients were more likely
   to perceive that care was more hazardous (odds ratio, 4.89; 95\% CI,
   2.49-9.59) compared with those who took care of mostly non-COVID-19 or
   no COVID-19 patients. In free-text responses, providers identified
   patient safety risks related to pandemic adaptations, such as
   ventilator-related lung injury, medication and diagnostic errors,
   oversedation, oxygen device removal, and falls. Conclusions Increased
   COVID-19 case burden was significantly associated with perceptions of a
   less safe patient care environment by frontline ICU clinicians. Results
   of the qualitative analysis identified specific patient safety hazards
   in ICUs across the United States as downstream consequences of hospital
   and provider strain during periods of the COVID-19 pandemic.},

   Based on Blockchain},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The use of low-cost sensors in IoT over high-cost devices has been
   considered less expensive. However, these low-cost sensors have their
   own limitations such as the accuracy, quality, and reliability of the
   data collected. Fog computing offers solutions to those limitations;
   nevertheless, owning to its intrinsic distributed architecture, it faces
   challenges in the form of security of fog devices, secure authentication
   and privacy. Blockchain technology has been utilised to offer solutions
   for the authentication and security challenges in fog systems. This
   paper proposes an authentication system that utilises the
   characteristics and advantages of blockchain and smart contracts to
   authenticate users securely. The implemented system uses the email
   address, username, Ethereum address, password and data from a biometric
   reader to register and authenticate users. Experiments showed that the
   proposed method is secure and achieved performance improvement when
   compared to existing methods. The comparison of results with
   state-of-the-art showed that the proposed authentication system consumed
   up to 30\% fewer resources in transaction and execution cost; however,
   there was an increase of up to 30\% in miner fees.},

Abstract = {The integration of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) within the
   smart grid has significantly enhanced the reliability, efficiency, and
   security of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services over the past decade, leading
   to increased research interest in this technology. Charging stations
   (CSs) utilize electric vehicles (EVs) to manage demand response and
   provide sustainable energy solutions. However, the transmission of
   information between EVs and CSs via public channels causes critical
   security vulnerabilities. Although much effort has been made to overcome
   the challenge of protecting security and privacy in V2G environments,
   these efforts have either been proposed based on a centralized
   architecture or do not ensure essential security requirements, such as
   self-sovereignty, reliable, and blockchain scalability. Furthermore, in
   decentralized network, it is difficult to provide reliable energy
   distribution because a malicious participant can easily try to inflate
   trading volumes and manipulate energy prices. In this paper, we propose
   a new blockchain-enabled, reliable, privacy-preserving scheme using
   decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for preventing energy wash trading in
   V2G networks called BAPS-DITS. BAPS-DITS guarantees to tackle the above
   challenges without a trusted third-party intervention. Additionally, we
   use informal and formal (mathematical) analysis to prove the security of
   BAPS-DITS and conduct a comparative analysis comparing the security
   properties, computational cost, and communication cost of BAPS-DITS to
   previous studies. Furthermore, we implement BAPS-DITS on a practical
   Ethereum network, demonstrating its efficiency and feasibility, showing
   that BAPS-DITS provides self-sovereignty, accountability, and blockchain
   scalability; thus, it is suitable for actual V2G environments.},

Abstract = {In this present era of IoT (Internet of Things) where billions of
   devices are to be connected and operated under a single communication
   framework, Unified communication is evolving with each passing day, by
   making its presence felt in several user scenarios like display of
   presence information of email recipients, text and video chat through IM
   etc. User can avail information through various video channels. It
   enables customers to get data through various information channel thus
   provides a faster message delivery. However this technology is widely
   used in laptops/computers. Recent study shows the scope of developing
   this technology in mobile based environments is on upper side. However
   there are two major security concerns during using mobile devices for
   work purpose. First, preventing data theft / data corruption during data
   flow through the network, and second, preventing data theft when the
   mobile device is lost / misplaced. First one may easily be resolved by
   using cryptography APIs, Encryption-Decryption algorithm etc. This paper
   focuses on the second aspect and tried to provide a unique way to solve
   the problem by using unified communication technologies and thereby
   minimizing the effect of losing mobile phones or other computing
   devices. This work tried to reduce the window time for stealing
   confidential data from mobile phone. The idea is to develop a Short
   Messaging Service (SMS) based system and a web based application that
   interacts with database and remotely wipe out the access rights to
   enterprise application of a mobile phone and minimize the data theft
   window.},

Title = {Threshold Password-Hardening Updatable Oblivious Key Management},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {20},
Pages = {4799-4814},
Abstract = {We propose a threshold password-hardening updatable oblivious key
   management system dubbed TPH-UOKM for cloud storage. In TPH-UOKM, a
   group of key servers share a user-specific secret key for a user, and
   assist the user in producing her/his password-derived private key in a
   threshold and oblivious way, where the password is hardened to resist
   offline dictionary guessing attacks. Anyone can outsource data protected
   with the user's password-derived public key to the cloud server, and
   merely the user holding the correct password can recover the
   password-derived private key for data access. TPH-UOKM can accomplish
   decryption of N ciphertexts with the complexity \$O(1)\$ of
   communication between a user and the key servers, which outperforms
   existing schemes. TPH-UOKM supports password update. The cloud server
   can update all protected data of a user with an update token to be
   accessible only with the new password, which resists password leakage.
   We present a two-level proactivization mechanism to periodically update
   user-specific secret key shares and the key servers to thwart perpetual
   compromise of them, where the renewal of user-specific secret key shares
   reduces computation and communication costs compared to existing
   approaches. Provable security and high efficiency of TPH-UOKM are
   demonstrated by comprehensive analyses and performance evaluations.},

Abstract = {The use of information systems is a solutions to support the operations
   of the institution. In order to access information systems in accordance
   with their access rights, usually the user will enter a username and
   password as the authentication process. However, this has a weakness if
   the other side is cheating by sniffing or tapping user passwords. This
   makes the password unsafe to use for access information systems. If the
   username and password if it is stolen, abuse will occur for the crime or
   theft of the owner's identity accounts like name, email, telephone
   number, biological mother's name, account number and others. One
   solution is to apply two factor authentication method which is
   Time-Based One Time Password (TOTP) and Secure Algorithm Hash Algorithm
   1 (SHA1). With this method, the system Authentication of a website or
   site does not only depend on the username and password to enter the
   account user but the user will get a token or code which is used to log
   in to the user's account. After testing hundred times, the
   authentication process who use Two Factor Authentication can tackle
   possible attacks on abuse o user access rights. Time Based Application
   One Time Password and Secure Hash Algorithm 1 Generate code that can't
   be the same because of the code it can only be used once with a time
   limit certain so it is difficult to guess. SHA1 with long input
   different strings will produce output with a fixed length string of 160
   bits. Test results are obtained the results that 30 seconds is enough to
   prevent hackers log in and take over the account without permission and
   also prove that two-factor authentication can increase the security of
   the authentication process well. The time above is the result of testing
   the process user authentication until the hacker sniffing against tokens
   to try to take over the account.},

Abstract = {Introduction: The goal of this study was to understand individuals with
   cerebral palsy (CP) and their family's attitudes and preferences to
   genomic research, including international data sharing and biobanking.
   Methods: Individuals with CP and their family members were invited to
   participate in the web-based survey via email (NSW/ACT CP Register) or
   via posts on social media by Cerebral Palsy Alliance, CP Research
   Network, and CP Now. Survey responses included yes/no/unsure, multiple
   choices, and Likert scales. Fisher's exact and chi(2) tests were used to
   assess if there were significant differences between subgroups. Results:
   Individuals with CP and their families (n = 145) were willing to
   participate in genomics research (68\%), data sharing (82\%), and
   biobanking efforts (75\%). This willingness to participate was
   associated with completion of tertiary education, previous genetic
   testing experience, overall higher genomic awareness, and trust in
   international researchers. The survey respondents also expressed ongoing
   communication and diverse information needs regarding the use of their
   samples and data. Major concerns were associated with privacy and data
   security. Discussion: The success of genomic research and international
   data sharing efforts in CP are contingent upon broad support and
   recruitment. Ongoing consultation and engagement of individuals with CP
   and their families will facilitate trust and promote increased awareness
   of genomics in CP that may in turn maximize participant uptake and
   recruitment.},

Abstract = {With the fastest technology of modern life we always have to deal with
   numerous data in various way. We simultaneously store and retrieve data
   in database of large organization, email server, cloud server etc.. Due
   to this process both the owner and user need security of the data and
   therefore the data is encrypted before use. Because of this encryption
   process, some problem arises at the time of searching and retrieving of
   particular data. Searchable encryption is a scheme which assures the
   owner and user a secure and efficient searching operation. There has
   been growing interest in searchable encryption in both academics and
   industry. Over the years different type of construction of searchable
   encryption have been introduced. In some of them, researchers have
   emphasize on the efficiency of searchable encryption technique and
   somewhere security and privacy have got more attention. In this paper, a
   comparative survey has done on various technique of searchable
   encryption.},

Abstract = {Hackers have many techniques available for breaching the security flaws
   of organizations. The human approach, called Social Engineering (SE), is
   probably the most difficult one to be dealt with. Social engineering is
   considered one of the most creative methods for gaining unauthorized
   access to information systems. This type of cyber threat does not
   require advanced technical knowledge because it relies mainly on human
   nature. Social engineers use different techniques, such as phishing, to
   manipulate people and cause significant damage to the organizations
   where they work. Therefore, organizations must raise the awareness of
   their users about social engineering attacks. Most organizations are
   putting all defense efforts into advanced technologies to prevent
   various threats. This is considered a wrong approach because employees
   of an organization use email, social networks, or other online sites as
   part of their work activities. Therefore, the prevention of attacks
   cannot be accomplished through advanced technologies alone, but the
   human aspect must also be studied. This paper comprehensively analyzes
   the existing literature in the taxonomy of social engineering attacks
   focusing on human aspects. It provides an overview of research
   opportunities that should be addressed and elaborated in future
   investigations.},

Abstract = {This paper presents RBACvisual, a user-level visualization tool designed
   to facilitate the study and teaching of the role-based access control
   (RBAC) model, which has been widely used in companies to restrict access
   to authorized users. RBACvisual provides two graphical abstractions of
   the underlying specification. Policies can be input and modified
   graphically or using text-based files. Students can use an embedded
   Query system to answer commonly asked questions and to test their
   understanding of a given policy. A Practice subsystem is also provided
   for instructors to assign quizzes to students; the answers can be sent
   to the instructor via email. We also present the results of an
   evaluation of RBACvisual within a senior-level course on information
   security. The student feedback was positive and indicated that
   RBACvisual helped students understand the model and enhanced the course.},

   emails have hosted such a phishing website, where a click on the URL or
   the malware code as executing some actions to perform is socially
   engineered messages. Lexically analyzing the URLs can enhance the
   performance and help to differentiate between the original email and the
   phishing URL. As assessed in this study, in addition to textual analysis
   of phishing URL, email classification is successful and results in a
   highly precise anti phishing.},

Year = {2021},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {During COVID-19 restrictions in spring 2020, college students
   experienced closed dormitories and increased unemployment and many
   students moved in with their families. College students were vulnerable
   to food insecurity pre-pandemic and this study examined how the living
   situations and food security status changed for Midwestern university
   students due to COVID-19 restrictions. An email survey administered to
   Iowa State University students between the ages of 18 and 30 who
   physically attended campus prior to its closure produced 1434 responses.
   Students living with a parent or guardian increased by 44\% and were
   less likely to experience food insecurity or less likely to work. They
   had lower stress and ate more home-cooked meals. Students living on
   their own had higher rates of food insecurity, greater stress, poorer
   health status, higher cooking self-efficacy, and worked more hours.
   Seventeen percent of all students were food insecure; related factors
   were non-White ethnicity, lower cooking self-efficacy, undergraduate
   status, receipt of financial aid, employment, stress, living in the same
   situation as before the campus closure, and consumption of more take-out
   or fast food. These individuals had more barriers to food access.
   Knowledge of these factors provide useful information to inform future
   support services for this population in similar conditions.},

Abstract = {This article surveys the literature on the detection of phishing
   attacks. Phishing attacks target vulnerabilities that exist in systems
   due to the human factor. Many cyber attacks are spread via mechanisms
   that exploit weaknesses found in end-users, which makes users the
   weakest element in the security chain. The phishing problem is broad and
   no single silver-bullet solution exists to mitigate all the
   vulnerabilities effectively, thus multiple techniques are often
   implemented to mitigate specific attacks. This paper aims at surveying
   many of the recently proposed phishing mitigation techniques. A
   high-level overview of various categories of phishing mitigation
   techniques is also presented, such as: detection, offensive defense,
   correction, and prevention, which we belief is critical to present where
   the phishing detection techniques fit in the overall mitigation process.},

Title = {Parents' Perceptions of a Serious Game for Educating Families on
   Prescription Opioid Safety: Qualitative Pilot Study of MedSMARxT:
   Adventures in PharmaCity},
Journal = {JMIR SERIOUS GAMES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Abstract = {Background: Opioid misuse is a pervasive, worsening problem that affects
   the health of people throughout the United States, including
   adolescents. There are few adolescent-focused interventions designed to
   educate them about opioid medication safety. The MedSMARxT: Adventures
   in PharmaCity, is a serious educational video game that teaches parents
   and their youths about safe opioid practices. Objective: This study
   aimed to elucidate parent's perceptions of MedSMARxT: Adventures in
   PharmaCity and its potential use by parents and their adolescents.
   Methods: Parents of adolescents aged 12 to 18 years who live in the
   United States were recruited from April to October 2021 via Qualtrics
   research panels, social media, email listserves, and snowball sampling.
   The study participants played MedSMARxT: Adventures in PharmaCity for 30
   minutes and then participated in a 30-minute postgame interview via
   WebEx (Cisco). Questions were developed and piloted to examine adults'
   perceptions of the game. Participants were asked three sets of
   open-ended questions: (1) questions about the game and elements of the
   game, (2) what they learned from the game, and (3) questions about their
   experience with games. Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim.
   Interview transcripts were coded using content and thematic analysis by
   study team members to identify major themes and subthemes from the data.
   Results: Parent participants (N=67) played MedSMARxT: Adventures in
   PharmaCity and completed a postgame interview. Analysis extrapolated
   four primary themes from the data: (1) participant gaming experience,
   (2) perception of game features, (3) educational purpose of the game,
   and (4) future use of the game. Most participants (n=56, 84\%), had at
   least some experience with video games. More than half of the
   participants (n=35, 52\%) participants, had positive reactions to the
   game characters and scenes depicted in MedSMARxT: Adventures in
   PharmaCity and stated they were realistic for adolescents. Most
   participants (n=39, 58\%), would recommend the game to others.
   Significant difficulties with gameplay navigation were reported by 38
   (57\%) participants, as well as a slow game pace. All participants were
   able to accurately identify the overarching goal of the game: opioid or
   medication safety. The game reinforced existing knowledge for
   participants, though many (n=15, 22\%), reported a new awareness of the
   need to store opioid medications in a locked area and the availability
   of medication disposal drop boxes at pharmacies. Participants stated
   that they would recommend the game for future use by families and youths
   in various health care and non-health care settings. Conclusions: The
   use of a tailored serious game is a novel, engaging tool to educate
   adolescents on opioid safety. MedSMARxT: Adventures in PharmaCity can be
   used as a tool for parents and adolescents to facilitate meaningful
   dialogue about safe and appropriate opioid use.},

Abstract = {Cyber-attacks on the internet are not a new phenomenon. Hackers are
   always looking for ways to breach the security of the internet. Good
   researchers continuously develop solutions to the problems of breaches
   in security. Human interaction proofs are also one of the most
   affordable solutions to problems. The completely automated public Turing
   test to tell computers and humans apart (CAPTCHA) has a wide range of
   applications, including website authentication, preventing bogus email
   registration, preventing bogus online polls, preventing bogus ticket
   booking, and so on. CAPTCHAs come in various formats, but text-based
   schemes are the most common. Unfortunately, these text-based CAPTCHAs
   are available in foreign languages and have a high success rate. The
   usability of these foreign language-based schemes for native people is
   also very low. These days, Hindi CAPTCHAs are available, but before
   using them, we must test the security of these schemes. In this study,
   ten different coloured CAPTCHAs are broken using the k-nearest
   neighbours, the support vector machine, and the random forest
   classifiers. The breaking rate for two-colour schemes is 90\%, while the
   breaking rate for multi-colour schemes is 93\%. The solving time for the
   support vector machine and the random forest classifier ranges from 0.06
   s to 0.09 s and 0.1 to 0.2 s in the case of two-colour schemes. For
   multi-colour schemes, it ranges from 0.06 s to 0.09 s and 0.09 s to 0.2
   s for the support vector machine and random forest classifier,
   respectively.},

Abstract = {SPam over Internet Telephony (SPIT) is expected to become a very serious
   issue in the next years. The threat is going to spin out from the well
   known email spam problem by bot nets being re-programmed to initiate not
   just spam emails but also Voice over IP (VoIP) calls. Preventing SPIT is
   a new problem, because many well-established methods for blocking email
   spam cannot be applied. Currently, several SPIT prevention methods are
   being proposed but SPIT prevention research is still at a very early
   stage. In this paper, we propose an innovative way to detect SPIT calls
   by comparing applying hidden Turing tests that compare them with typical
   human communication patterns. For passing these tests, significant
   resource consumptions at the SPIT generating hot nets would be required
   which contradicts the spammer's objective of placing as many SPIT calls
   as possible,
   The proposed method has several advantages compared to other methods
   that also interact with the caller. We validated its feasibility with a
   prototype implementation that we integrated into our modular VoIP
   security system called VoIP SEAL.},

Abstract = {Attacks exploiting the innate and the acquired vulnerabilities of human
   users have posed severe threats to cybersecurity. This work proposes
   ADVERT, a human-technical solution that generates adaptive visual aids
   in real-time to prevent users from inadvertence and reduce their
   susceptibility to phishing attacks. Based on the eye-tracking data, we
   extract visual states and attention states as system-level sufficient
   statistics to characterize the user's visual behaviors and attention
   status. By adopting a data-driven approach and two learning feedback of
   different time scales, this work lays out a theoretical foundation to
   analyze, evaluate, and particularly modify humans' attention processes
   while they vet and recognize phishing emails. We corroborate the
   effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of ADVERT through a case study
   based on the data set collected from human subject experiments conducted
   at New York University. The results show that the visual aids can
   statistically increase the attention level and improve the accuracy of
   phishing recognition from 74.6\% to a minimum of 86\%. The
   meta-adaptation can further improve the accuracy to 91.5\% (resp.
   93.7\%) in less than 3 (resp. 50) tuning stages.},

Abstract = {Phishing has been a major problem for information systems managers and
   users for several years now. In 2008, it was estimated that phishing
   resulted in close to \$50 billion in damages to U.S. consumers and
   businesses. Even so, research has yet to explore many of the reasons why
   Internet users continue to be exploited. The goal of this paper is to
   better understand the behavioral factors that may increase one's
   susceptibility for complying with a phisher's request for personal
   information. Using past research on deception detection, a research
   model was developed to help explain compliant phishing responses. The
   model was tested using a field study in which each participant received
   a phishing e-mail asking for sensitive information. It was found that
   four behavioral factors were influential as to whether the phishing
   e-mails were answered with sensitive information. The paper concludes by
   suggesting that the behavioral aspect of susceptible users be integrated
   into the current tools and materials used in antiphishing efforts.},

Abstract = {The development of digitization over the globe has made digital security
   inescapable. As every single article on this planet is being digitalized
   quickly, it is more important to protect those items. Numerous cyber
   threats effectively deceive ordinary individuals to take away their
   identifications. Phishing is a kind of social engineering attack where
   the hackers are using this kind of attack in modern days to steal the
   user's credentials. After a systematic research analysis of phishing
   technique and email scam, an intrusion detection system in chrome
   extension is developed. This technique is used to detect real-time
   phishing by examining the URL, domain, content and page attributes of an
   URL prevailing in an email and any web page portion. Considering the
   reliability, robustness and scalability of an efficient phishing
   detection system, we designed a lightweight and proactive rule-based
   incremental construction approach to detect any unknown phishing URLs.
   Due to the computational intelligence and nondependent of the blacklist
   signatures, this application can detect the zero-day and spear phishing
   attacks with a detection rate of 89.12\% and 76.2\%, respectively. The
   true positive values acquired in our method is 97.13\% and it shows less
   than 1.5\% of false positive values. Thus the application shows the
   precision level higher than the previous model developed and other
   phishing techniques. The overall results indicate that our framework
   outperforms the existing method in identifying phishing URLs.},

Title = {Optimized dual access control for cloud-based data storage and
   distribution using global-context residual recurrent neural network},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {151},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Cloud computing has become a prevalent platform for data storage and
   evaluation, but its open access through the internet makes stored data
   vulnerable to a range of security threats. The existing security
   mechanisms, though effective, often fall short in addressing advanced
   and evolving intrusion techniques. This motivates the need for a more
   robust, efficient, and intelligent access control system that can not
   only detect intrusions but also prevent unauthorized access in
   real-time. This study proposes an Optimized Dual Access Control
   mechanism for secure cloud-based data storage and distribution using
   Global-Context Residual Recurrent Neural Network (DACGCRRNN-FOFMOA-CDS).
   This novel approach aims to enhance both data protection and access
   management in cloud environments. The proposed methodology contains
   three distinct phases: (i) registration phase, (ii) intrusion detection
   phase, (iii) intrusion prevention phase. During the registration phase,
   user credentials are created for secure data uploads. The data undergoes
   pre-processing in the intrusion detection phase, where redundant and
   noisy information is filtered out using Poisson Multi-Bernoulli Mixture
   Filtering (PMBMF). This ensures data normalization and sanitization,
   preparing it for the classification process. The core of this process
   involves the use of the Global-Context Residual Recurrent Neural Network
   (GCRRNN), which automatically classifies users as legitimate or
   unauthorized. To further enhance classification accuracy, the GCRRNN is
   optimized using the Fractional-Order Fish Migration Optimization
   Algorithm (FOFMOA). The intrusion prevention phase involves verifying
   user identity through login credentials, ensuring robust protection
   against unauthorized access. The effectiveness of the proposed
   DAC-GCRRNN-FOFMOA-CDS model is validated using the Enron Email Database,
   and its performance is measured through key metrics like sensitivity,
   precision, F-score, specificity, error rate, accuracy, and ROC curve
   analysis. The proposed method attains 23.98 \%, 21 \%, 29\% higher
   accuracy, 27.94\%, 21.09\%, 30\% higher precision, 10.87 \%, 17.98 \%,
   22 \% lower error rate compared with the existing techniques.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the critical issue of internet scams targeting
   seniors by developing a robust, Machine Learning (ML) based solution
   employing a Large Language Model (LLM), specifically ChatGPT, to enhance
   scam detection and prevention. Elderly internet users are particularly
   vulnerable to digital fraud due to a lack of familiarity with
   technological safeguards and a tendency not to report incidents.
   Traditional security measures often fail to accommodate the unique
   challenges faced by this demographic, prompting our focus on a
   specialized, user-friendly solution. We propose an innovative approach
   using ChatGPT 3.5 to analyze and score emails based on their likelihood
   of being scams, thus providing seniors with a tool that requires minimal
   interaction while offering maximum protection. This system uses a custom
   rubric developed through ML techniques to evaluate potential threats
   effectively. By integrating word embeddings and a diverse training
   dataset, the model adapts to the nuanced and evolving nature of scam
   tactics. The methodology utilized in this paper ensures that the ML
   model not only identifies common scam indicators but also provides
   actionable feedback to users, making it a practical tool for real-world
   applications. Preliminary results demonstrate the system's efficacy in
   recognizing scam emails, thereby significantly reducing the risk of
   financial loss among seniors and enhancing their confidence in digital
   communication. This paper outlines the design, implementation, and
   testing phases of the project, highlighting the potential of LLMs in
   cybersecurity, specifically in protecting a vulnerable population.},

Abstract = {Electronic mail (e-mail) has been used to transfer various types of
   electronic data in Internet. Usually, a user has to send an e-mail to a
   specific group of users with a secure delivery mechanism. In this paper,
   a novel and feasible e-mail delivery mechanism using the secure
   multicast protocol with an ID-based factorial number structure (FNS) is
   proposed in the multicast system. In the proposed e-mail delivery
   mechanism, the e-mail is required to be encrypted before sending out in
   order to safeguard the message via a public channel, such as wire public
   switching communication links and wireless communication systems.
   Without loss generality, the public-key system is adopted in the
   proposed secure multicast system for a convenient and easy key
   management. The proposed scheme outperforms the existing methods for
   more easily to construct secure e-mail system. Furthermore, the security
   of the proposed scheme is analyzed, including replay attack, sender
   impersonation attack, unknown key-share attack, forgery attack and
   insider attack. Finally, the computation complexities of the proposed
   mechanism are discussed. The result shows that the proposed scheme
   outperforms the CRT-based secure e-mail scheme.},

Abstract = {What type of user data are the mobile applications sending? With the
   plethora of mobile applications available on the online stores, most of
   the users are unaware about the security risks they may pose. These
   include breaching end user's privacy by sharing unencrypted private and
   sensitive data to app's own server or third parties without user's
   approval. In this research, we tested 70 iOS applications dynamically
   through network penetration. Out of these, 20 apps were popular social
   networking and messaging applications. These were analyzed for their
   runtime behavior and their network traces were used for reconstruction
   of application layer payload. In about 15 apps out of 20, we were able
   to trace and reconstruct at least one of the entire message content,
   user's location, email credentials (including passwords), social
   networking credentials, profile images or tweeted messages. Apart from
   that, network traffic of 50 iOS applications was captured to check how
   end user's data is shared over the network. It was particularly found
   that many apps share authorized/unauthorized information of app user in
   unencrypted form. Apart from testing run-time behavior of applications
   proposed work can be used to warn app developers about unintentional
   security holes.},

Abstract = {Firewall protects a network from outside attacks, however, once an
   attack entering a network, it is difficult to detect. Recent
   significance accidents happened. i.e.: millions of Yahoo email account
   were stolen and crucial data from institutions are held for ransom.
   Within two year Yahoo's system administrators were not aware that there
   are intruder inside the network. This happened due to the lack of
   intelligent tools to monitor user behaviour in internal network. This
   paper discusses a design of an intelligent anomaly/malware detection
   system with proper proactive actions. The aim is to equip the system
   administrator with a proper tool to battle the insider attackers. The
   proposed system adopts machine learning to analyse user's behaviour
   through the runtime behaviour of each node in the network. The machine
   learning techniques include: deep learning, evolving machine learning
   perceptron, hybrid of Neural Network and Fuzzy, as well as predictive
   memory techniques. The proposed system is expanded to deal with larger
   network using agent techniques.},

Title = {Forward Legal Anonymous Group Pairing-Onion Routing for Mobile

Abstract = {Mobile Opportunistic Networks (MONs) often experience frequent
   interruptions in end-to-end connections, which increases the likelihood
   of message loss during delivery and makes users more susceptible to
   various cyber attacks. However, most currently proposed anonymous
   routing protocols are primarily designed for networks with stable
   connections, making it challenging to protect user identities in MONs.
   To address these challenges, we propose FLAG-POR (Forward Legal
   Anonymous Group Pairing-Onion Routing), a novel anonymous routing
   protocol specifically tailored to enhance message delivery anonymity and
   security in MONs. Specifically, we abstract the mobile opportunistic
   network as a contact graph. By introducing the concept of ``groups{''}
   into the pairing-onion routing protocol, which encrypts messages and
   relay nodes layer by layer, we develop a novel group-based pairing-onion
   routing protocol. This protocol ensures message confidentiality and
   relay node anonymity, while also improving message forwarding rates, as
   any node within a group can potentially act as a relay. To ensure
   message authenticity, we employ the efficient SM2 signing algorithm to
   generate signatures for the message source. Furthermore, by
   incorporating parameters such as the public key validity period and
   master key validity period into the group pairing-onion routing
   protocol, we achieve forward security in message delivery. We conduct a
   thorough theoretical analysis of the protocol's security and
   performance. The experimental results demonstrate that our FLAG-POR
   protocol outperforms baseline anonymous protocols in terms of delivery
   success rate, traceability rate, path anonymity, and node anonymity.
   Additionally, the FLAG-POR scheme effectively resists three potential
   threats to the routing system: collusion attack threat, node
   identification threat, and path identification threat, in any situation.},

Abstract = {Soft keyboard is perhaps the most common human input device on
   smartphone. This study designed and implemented a proof-of-concept soft
   keyboard keylogger in Android. The soft keyboard app was designed to
   have the capability to capture keystrokes from user and save it. It also
   can record the GPS location of user at the time of typing and sent it to
   a remote server. From our testing, the app was capable of recording the
   keystroke from user and their location. Since a keyboard app is normally
   used for typing message and email, filling confidential information,
   filling username and password, and so on, a soft keyboard application
   has the potential to be used for malicious activities.},

Abstract = {Information security is one of the main concerns today. Digital
   signature plays an important role to ensure authentication,
   non-integrity and non-repudiation on a message. Digital signature can be
   computed using RSA, DSA and elliptic curve cryptography. It can be
   simple signature in which hash of the message is encrypted with the
   private key of the sender. This private key and corresponding public
   keys are generated by CA, and public key are bind in the digital
   certificate. Another approach is Identity Based (ID) signature in which
   private keys are generated by PKG and public key is derived from the
   user's identity. This is also known as certificate less communication.
   In ID based signature, there is no need to transmit public key over
   unsecure channel. Public keys are efficiently derived from the
   receiver's identity information such as name, email address, network
   address, IP address and now aadhar number. Email address can be forged
   by unauthorized persons. Today aadhar number is used as unique identity
   proof that can be used as ID to derive public key of the user. In this
   paper we have used aadhar number to propose an efficient and secure
   identity based multiple signature schemes using RSA. Proposed scheme is
   secure against forgery and public key replacement attack.},

Abstract = {The market for Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) is growing at a rapid
   pace. An increasing number of products, such as the PalmPilot, are
   adding wireless communications capabilities. PDA users are now able to
   send and receive email just as they would from their networked desktop
   machines. Because of the inherent insecurity of wireless environments, a
   system is needed for secure email communications. The requirements for
   the security system will likely be influenced by the constraints of the
   PDA, including limited memory, limited processing power, limited
   bandwidth, and a limited user interface.
   This paper describes our experience with porting PGP to the Research in
   Motion (RIM) two-way pager, and incorporating elliptic curve
   cryptography into PGP's suite of public-key ciphers. Our main conclusion
   is that PGP is a viable solution for providing secure and interoperable
   email communications between constrained wireless devices and desktop
   machines.},

Abstract = {This case study details the process and lessons learnt from converting a
   compulsory comprehensive organisational survey from email to online
   format. The conversion was undertaken to improve data quality and reduce
   respondent burden. Key considerations in developing the online survey
   were ease of use, security and access. The new intuitive system allowed
   simultaneous access for multiple users, and incorporated dynamic
   indicators of progress and validation of numeric data. Reactions to the
   survey were mainly positive - about 75\% of user feedback was positive
   or neutral, they reported the survey was ``user friendly{''} and
   preferred the online format. Negative comments focused predominantly on
   the feature of expanding and collapsing questions which these
   respondents found difficult to manage. Administration of the survey was
   streamlined, with considerable reduction in time spent in checking and
   correcting responses for both respondents and data collectors. Although
   substantial improvements were recognised and appreciated by many users,
   it is important to acknowledge that users adapt to new technology at
   different speeds, and adequate support needs to be implemented for all
   users.},

Title = {MoodHacker Mobile Web App With Email for Adults to Self-Manage
   Mild-to-Moderate Depression: Randomized Controlled Trial},

Abstract = {Background: Worldwide, depression is rated as the fourth leading cause
   of disease burden and is projected to be the second leading cause of
   disability by 2020. Annual depression-related costs in the United States
   are estimated at US \$210.5 billion, with employers bearing over 50\% of
   these costs in productivity loss, absenteeism, and disability. Because
   most adults with depression never receive treatment, there is a need to
   develop effective interventions that can be more widely disseminated
   through new channels, such as employee assistance programs (EAPs), and
   directly to individuals who will not seek face-to-face care.
   Objective: This study evaluated a self-guided intervention, using the
   MoodHacker mobile Web app to activate the use of cognitive behavioral
   therapy (CBT) skills in working adults with mild-to-moderate depression.
   It was hypothesized that MoodHacker users would experience reduced
   depression symptoms and negative cognitions, and increased behavioral
   activation, knowledge of depression, and functioning in the workplace.
   Methods: A parallel two-group randomized controlled trial was conducted
   with 300 employed adults exhibiting mild-to-moderate depression.
   Participants were recruited from August 2012 through April 2013 in
   partnership with an EAP and with outreach through a variety of
   additional non-EAP organizations. Participants were blocked on
   race/ethnicity and then randomly assigned within each block to receive,
   without clinical support, either the MoodHacker intervention (n=150) or
   alternative care consisting of links to vetted websites on depression
   (n=150). Participants in both groups completed online self-assessment
   surveys at baseline, 6 weeks after baseline, and 10 weeks after
   baseline. Surveys assessed (1) depression symptoms, (2) behavioral
   activation, (3) negative thoughts, (4) worksite outcomes, (5) depression
   knowledge, and (6) user satisfaction and usability. After randomization,
   all interactions with subjects were automated with the exception of
   safety-related follow-up calls to subjects reporting current suicidal
   ideation and/or severe depression symptoms.
   Results: At 6-week follow-up, significant effects were found on
   depression, behavioral activation, negative thoughts, knowledge, work
   productivity, work absence, and workplace distress. MoodHacker yielded
   significant effects on depression symptoms, work productivity, work
   absence, and workplace distress for those who reported access to an EAP,
   but no significant effects on these outcome measures for those without
   EAP access. Participants in the treatment arm used the MoodHacker app an
   average of 16.0 times (SD 13.3), totaling an average of 1.3 hours (SD
   1.3) of use between pretest and 6-week follow-up. Significant effects on
   work absence in those with EAP access persisted at 10-week follow-up.
   Conclusions: This randomized effectiveness trial found that the
   MoodHacker app produced significant effects on depression symptoms
   (partial eta(2) = .021) among employed adults at 6-week follow-up when
   compared to subjects with access to relevant depression Internet sites.
   The app had stronger effects for individuals with access to an EAP
   (partial eta(2) = .093). For all users, the MoodHacker program also
   yielded greater improvement on work absence, as well as the mediating
   factors of behavioral activation, negative thoughts, and knowledge of
   depression self-care. Significant effects were maintained at 10-week
   follow-up for work absence. General attenuation of effects at 10-week
   follow-up underscores the importance of extending program contacts to
   maintain user engagement. This study suggests that light-touch,
   CBT-based mobile interventions like MoodHacker may be appropriate for
   implementation within EAPs and similar environments. In addition, it
   seems likely that supporting MoodHacker users with guidance from
   counselors may improve effectiveness for those who seek in-person
   support.},

Abstract = {Many scenarios require confidential communication and protection against
   active attackers. The way to establish trust between devices and
   authenticate these networks depends completely on the scenario. In Body
   Area Networks human biometrics can serve as a shared secret among
   devices. In real-time voice communication, the ZRTP protocol allows for
   interactive trust establishment by recognizing the peer's voice. In
   asynchronous networks, such as email, other interactive mechanisms have
   been deployed, such as key fingerprint verification.
   In our research, we are analyzing the security and usability of existing
   trust mechanisms for heterogeneous networks. Furthermore, we are
   proposing protocol changes and new mechanisms to establish trust between
   devices. In this paper an overview is given over existing and upcoming
   research in this area. For synchronous networks, human biometrics, such
   as human gait or a peer's voice, are used as trust anchors. For
   asynchronous networks, the usability of interactive public-key
   verification mechanism are analyzed as trust anchors.},

Abstract = {The patient safety literature from the past decade emphasizes the
   importance of teamwork skills and human factors in preventing medical
   errors. Simulation has been used within aviation, the military, and now
   health care domains to effectively teach and assess teamwork skills.
   However, attempts to expand and generalize research and training
   principles have been limited due to a lack of a well-defined,
   well-researched taxonomy. As part of the 2008 Academic Emergency
   Medicine Consensus Conference on ``The Science of Simulation in
   Healthcare,{''} a subset of the group expertise and group assessment
   breakout sections identified evidence-based recommendations for an
   emergency medicine (EM) team taxonomy and performance model. This
   material was disseminated within the morning session and was discussed
   both during breakout sessions and via online messaging. Below we present
   a well-defined, well-described taxonomy that will help guide design,
   implementation, and assessment of simulation-based team training
   programs.},

Abstract = {Background: Nursing interventions in the post-operative time period
   including psychological and emotional support, adverse event education,
   and instructions for follow-up care contribute patient satisfaction,
   safety, and quality of life. However, the time spent in the
   post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and hospital continues to shorten
   around the world to reduce health care spending and improve patient
   outcomes. Nurses conducting research during the important post-operative
   recovery period need to utilize unique techniques and emerging
   technologies to contact, recruit and collect data outside of the
   hospital setting including the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)
   platform.Aims: This paper describes the feasibility and acceptability,
   facilitators and barriers of the software application, REDCap, to
   complete a repeated-measures, descriptive correlational study in
   patients undergoing outpatient breast cancer surgeries.Methods \&
   Materials: The recruitment, data collection and storage were completed
   utilizing the secure REDCap Platform. The Institutional Research Board
   (IRB)-approved study was a repeated-measures, descriptive, correlational
   study with data collection at three time points. The data points aligned
   with important transitions and routine visits to improve data collection
   feasibility and increase relevance to clinical practice.Results: The
   sample consisted of women diagnosed with breast cancer undergoing breast
   conserving surgery between August 15 and October 15, 2020. There were
   123 potential participants, of which 76 started the surveys and 75
   participated (61\%) responded and participated in the study on
   Post-operative Day 1. Fifty-nine participants (78\%) completed the
   surveys on post-operative Day 14.Discussion: As the frequency of
   outpatient treatment increases, nurses conducting post-operative
   research will need to collect the data outside of the hospital
   setting.Conclusion: Email provides a method of studying new phenomena by
   recruiting participants, providing information about the study, and
   collecting results in a non-traditional setting. REDCap provides a
   method to facilitate nursing research through a securely encrypted
   integrated process.},

Abstract = {Digital signatures guarantee practical security only if the
   corresponding verification keys are distributed authentically; however,
   arguably, satisfying solutions for the latter haven't been found yet.
   This paper introduces a novel approach for cryptographic message
   authentication where this problem does not arise: A linkable message
   tagging scheme (LMT) identifies pairs of messages and accompanying
   authentication tags as related if and only if these tags were created
   using the same secret key. Importantly, our primitive fully avoids
   public keys, and hence elegantly sidesteps the key distribution problem
   of signature schemes.
   As an application of LMT we envision an email authentication system with
   minimal user interaction. Email clients could routinely equip all
   outgoing messages with corresponding tags and verify for incoming
   messages whether they indeed originate from the same entity as
   previously or subsequently received messages with identical sender
   address.
   As technical contributions we formalize the notions of LMT and its (more
   efficient) variant CMT (classifiable message tagging), including
   corresponding notions of unforgeability. For both variants we propose a
   range of provably secure constructions, basing on different hardness
   assumptions, with and without requiring random oracles.},

Title = {Word usage mirrors community structure in the online social network
   Twitter},
Journal = {EPJ DATA SCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Language has functions that transcend the transmission of
   information and varies with social context. To find out how language and
   social network structure interlink, we studied communication on Twitter,
   a broadly-used online messaging service.
   Results: We show that the network emerging from user communication can
   be structured into a hierarchy of communities, and that the frequencies
   of words used within those communities closely replicate this pattern.
   Consequently, communities can be characterised by their most
   significantly used words. The words used by an individual user, in turn,
   can be used to predict the community of which that user is a member.
   Conclusions: This indicates a relationship between human language and
   social networks, and suggests that the study of online communication
   offers vast potential for understanding the fabric of human society. Our
   approach can be used for enriching community detection with word
   analysis, which provides the ability to automate the classification of
   communities in social networks and identify emerging social groups.},

   chose to participate in this study from June to July 2020. In response
   to the COVID-19 pandemic, dairies have implemented or increased
   biosecurity measures and COVID-19 precautions. Dairies reported adequate
   personal protective equipment for their workers, though face masks were
   not required on most dairies (n = 32, 86\%). Producers were concerned
   about the safety of their families, maintaining a healthy workforce, and
   keeping their farms profitable. Access to healthcare was not perceived
   to be an issue for their workers. One-quarter of dairies reported
   COVID-19 infections on their farms. Even though the majority had an
   isolation protocol in place if someone on the farm were to become ill,
   less than half of respondents felt their farm was protected against
   COVID-19. Two-thirds of producers have not had to decrease production,
   and a majority of operations have not furloughed or terminated employees
   due to COVID-19. Our data suggest that dairy farms in Minnesota and
   Wisconsin have implemented biosecurity and safety measures in response
   to COVID-19. These measures can be improved. Farms would benefit from
   additional guidance and education on implementation of personal
   protective measures and disease prevention strategies to keep workers
   employed and safe.},

Abstract = {Phishing is a message-based computer attack sent to deceive and exploit
   recipients via email. Phishing is a problem for organizations because
   getting ``hooked,{''} or tricked into acting on behalf of the sender,
   can put sensitive personal and organizational data at risk. In this
   research, we draw from several theoretical perspectives concerning
   social distance and trust as an exploitable resource to provide evidence
   that, even in contexts where actual social distance and intentions are
   nearly impossible to determine, people look to category-based signals of
   social distance to establish trust, which increases the likelihood of
   deception. We present the results of a validation study and a randomized
   field experiment in which we sent phishing emails to all employees of an
   insurance company.},

Abstract = {Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution for enhancing
   the security and integrity of various applications, including identity
   management systems. This research paper presents the design and
   implementation of an Identity Management System (IMS) using the Solidity
   programming language and the Ethereum blockchain platform. The IMS
   allows users to register and manage their identities in a secure and
   decentralized manner. The system employs a struct-based data structure
   to store user identity information, including name, email, age, and
   verification status. The functionalities of registering an identity,
   verifying an identity, and retrieving identity information are
   implemented as smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The paper
   discusses the advantages of using blockchain technology for identity
   management, such as immutability, transparency, and enhanced security.
   It also explores the potential applications of the IMS in sectors like
   finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. The research findings demonstrate
   the feasibility and effectiveness of blockchain-based identity
   management systems in mitigating identity fraud and unauthorized access.
   Future research directions and challenges for scaling and
   interoperability are also discussed, highlighting the need for
   standardization and integration with existing identity frameworks. The
   IMS serves as a foundation for further research and development in the
   field of blockchain-based identity management, paving the way for more
   secure and user-centric digital identities in the era of decentralized
   systems.},

Title = {Privacy preserving search services against online attack},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {95},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Searchable functionality is provided in many online services such as
   mail services or outsourced data storage. To protect users privacy, data
   in these services is usually stored after being encrypted using
   searchable encryption. This enables the data user to securely search
   encrypted data from a remote server without leaking data and query
   information. Public key encryption with keyword search is one of the
   research branches of searchable encryption; this provides
   privacy-preserving searchable functionality for applications such as
   encrypted email systems. However, it has an inherent vulnerability in
   that the information of a query may be leaked using a keyword guessing
   attack. Most of existing works aim to make the system resistant to
   offline keyword guessing, but this does not protect against online
   attacks on real world services. In this paper, we move a step forward to
   present a generic framework able to resist online keyword guessing
   attack using a server-assisted model. Specifically, we design a novel
   primitive C mirrored all-but-one lossy encryption, which can prevent a
   specific user from generating valid encryptions. This primitive can be
   seen as an access control on encryption ability. Combining searchable
   encryption technique with the new primitive makes online keyword
   guessing attack impossible for the specified user, even if the attack is
   launched online. We further give formal security analysis for the
   generic framework, and a concrete implementation with efficiency
   analysis to show that our design is practical. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {PurposeUsers are key stakeholders in event facilities, and therefore
   facilities management (FM) services must meet their needs and
   expectations. The paper aims to assess users' perceptions of FM
   practices and sustainability in event facilities in higher education
   institutions.Design/methodology/approachThe study used a descriptive
   design approach to explore the perceptions of end-users of event
   facilities. Using Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology as
   a case study, 384 users of the event facilities were contacted through
   the email directory of the event facilities. Questionnaires were used to
   collect data and analysed in descriptive and inferential statistics with
   the aid of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS
   v22.0).FindingsThe study categorised users' perceptions into customer
   care, security and safety and service quality dimensions. The results
   revealed that constituent key important indices of these three
   dimensions were not significant at both the composite and individual
   levels. Thus, the users generally perceived FM practices in the event
   facilities to be below standard. None of the three sustainability
   constituents was significant, suggesting that users perceived event FM
   sustainability practices as below standard.Practical implicationsThe
   study presents users' perceptions of FM practices in event facilities.
   It has also suggested effective ways of managing event facilities to
   improve user comfort, safety and satisfaction.Originality/valueThe study
   provides relevant information on users' perceptions of FM practices. It
   specifically has sustainable FM as a key component, which is crucial for
   achieving sustainable development goals.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL EDUCATION},

Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Objectives: This study aims to explore the perspectives of standardized
   patients previously involved in equity-seeking healthcare training
   simulation activities to better understand how stakeholders can engage
   and support standardized patients in the delivery of educational
   opportunities for healthcare professionals related to equity, diversity,
   and inclusivity. Methods: A qualitative research study was conducted
   utilizing semi-structured interviews with persons (N=15) who
   self-identified as being involved in the development and/or the delivery
   of simulations related to equity, diversity, and/or inclusion.
   Participants were recruited via email using internal and public lists
   for standardized patient programs and through snowball sampling.
   Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim and transcripts were
   analyzed qualitatively in an iterative coding process, anchored by
   direct content analysis methodology, and informed by three theoretical
   perspectives: the standardized patient journey, psychological safety,
   and empowerment theory. Results: We constructed three main themes: (1)
   safety should be prioritized throughout the journey; (2) empowerment is
   key to engagement; and (3) standardized patient trainers are central
   connectors for safety and empowerment. Conclusions: Through the
   perspectives of standardized patients, this study has provided insight
   on strategies to engage and support those participating in
   equity-seeking simulations. Focused attention on safety and empowerment
   is warranted, with trainers having a critical role in empowering
   standardized patients to succeed in equity-seeking simulations. Future
   research should continue to explore best practices surrounding engaging,
   supporting, and retaining individuals involved in equity-seeking
   healthcare training, including comprehensive training for trainers on
   how to ensure, maintain, and restore standardized patients'
   psychological safety.},

Abstract = {Forward-secure signatures are proposed to diminish the damage of key
   exposure, in which the security of signatures prior to the period of key
   exposure can be kept. Identity-based signatures can reduce the
   complexity and the cost for managing the public key because the public
   key is replaced by any known information of a user's identity. In this
   paper, we discuss a new issue related to integrating forward-secure and
   identity-based primitives into standard applications of personal network
   communication security such as pretty good privacy suite and
   secure/multipurpose internet mail extensions in which the secret key is
   additionally protected by an extra secret that is possibly derived from
   a password. One major contribution of this paper is to construct the
   first forward-secure identity-based signature scheme in untrusted update
   environments. In this scheme, the public key can be derived from some
   arbitrary identification value such as an email address or a phone
   number, and the signing key is additionally shielded by a second factor
   derived from a user's password. Key update can be completed by the
   encrypted version of signing keys. The second factor is only needed when
   the signatures are produced. In addition, we give the definitions of
   forward security and update security in this kind of signature. At last,
   formal proofs of forward security and update security in the random
   oracle model are provided under the CDH assumption.},

Title = {Your culture is in your password: An analysis of a
   demographically-diverse password dataset},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},

Volume = {77},

Abstract = {A large number of studies on passwords make use of passwords leaked by
   attackers who compromised online services. Frequently, these leaks
   contain only the passwords themselves, or basic information such as
   usemames or email addresses. While metadata-rich leaks exist, they are
   often limited in the variety of demographics they cover.
   In this work, we analyze a meta-data rich data leak from a Middle
   Eastern bank,with a demographically-diverse user base. We provide an
   analysis of passwords created by groups of people of different cultural
   backgrounds, some of which are under-represented in existing data leaks,
   e.g., Arab, Filipino, Indian, and Pakistani.
   The contributions provided by this work are many-fold. First, our
   results contribute to the existing body of knowledge regarding how users
   include personal information in their passwords. Second, we illustrate
   the differences that exist in how users from different
   cultural/linguistic backgrounds create passwords. Finally, we study the
   (empirical and theoretical) guessability of the dataset based on two
   attacker models, and show that a state of the art password strength
   estimator inflates the strength of passwords created by users from
   nonEnglish speaking backgrounds. We improve its estimations by training
   it with contextually relevant information. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Anonymous messaging system allows users to deliver messages without
   revealing the sending content and their identifiers, which has attracted
   ongoing concerns. However, to the best of our knowledge, all the
   existing solutions still fail to protect users' privacy under coercion.
   That is, the user's communication transcripts might be tracked and
   cached, and later coerced to reveal the underlying messages associated
   with the ciphertexts due to law enforcement reasons or for evil
   purposes. In addition, anonymity alone is not enough for some practical
   scenarios. For instance, a journalist just wants to communicate with
   those intended informants, and thereby gather information from anonymous
   but authenticated sources. In this paper, to address the above-mentioned
   issues, we introduce an authenticated and deniable anonymous messaging
   framework. Its core component is a new cryptographic primitive dubbed
   deniable identity-based matchmaking encryption (DIB-ME), which captures
   plausible deniability under coercion and mutual authentication without
   interactions simultaneously. We further present a concrete DIB-ME
   construction and prove its security in the random oracle model. The
   performance analysis indicates merits of the proposed DIB-ME scheme. We
   also implement the proposed DIB-ME construction and present extensive
   experiment results, as a proof of concept to demonstrate its soundness
   and practicability.},

Title = {Evaluating and volunteering for crowdsourced interventions:
   Cross-sectional data on COVID-19 safety from a University Survey},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 29},
Abstract = {Despite many innovative ideas generated in response to COVID-19, few
   studies have examined community preferences for these ideas. Our study
   aimed to determine university community members' preferences for three
   novel ideas identified through a crowdsourcing open call at the
   University of North Carolina (UNC) for making campus safer in the
   pandemic, as compared to existing (i.e. pre-COVID-19) resources. An
   online survey was conducted from March 30, 2021 -May 6, 2021. Survey
   participants included UNC students, staff, faculty, and others. The
   online survey was distributed using UNC's mass email listsery and
   research directory, departmental listservs, and student text groups.
   Collected data included participant demographics, COVID-19 prevention
   behaviors, preferences for finalist ideas vs. existing resources in
   three domains (graduate student supports, campus tours, and online
   learning), and interest in volunteering with finalist teams. In total
   437 survey responses were received from 228 (52\%) staff, 119 (27\%)
   students, 78 (18\%) faculty, and 12 (3\%) others. Most participants were
   older than age 30 years (309; 71\%), women (332, 78\%), and white (363,
   83.1\%). Five participants (1\%) were gender minorities, 66 (15\%)
   identified as racial/ethnic minorities, and 46 (10\%) had a disability.
   Most participants preferred the finalist idea for a virtual campus tour
   of UNC's lesser-known history compared to the existing campus tour
   (52.2\% vs. 16.0\%). For graduate student supports, 41.4\% of
   participants indicated no preference between the finalist idea and
   existing supports; for online learning resources, the existing resource
   was preferred compared to the finalist idea (41.6\% vs. 30.4\%). Most
   participants agreed that finalists' ideas would have a positive impact
   on campus safety during COVID-19 (81.2\%, 79.6\%, and 79.2\% for
   finalist ideas 1, 2 and 3 respectively). 61 (14.1\%) participants
   indicated interest in volunteering with finalist teams. Together these
   findings contribute to the development and implementation of
   community-engaged crowdsourced campus safety interventions during
   COVID-19.},

Abstract = {Multi-Factor Authentication is an electronic authentication method in
   which a computer user is granted access to an application or a website
   only after successfully presenting two or more factors, or pieces of
   evidence. It is the first step to protect systems against intruders
   since the traditional log-in methods (username and password) are not
   completely protected from hackers, since they can guess them easily.
   using tools. Current Systems use additional methods to increase
   security, such as using two-factor authentication based on a one-time
   password via mobile or email, or authentication based on biometrics
   (fingerprint, eye iris or retina, and face recognition) or via token
   devices. However, these methods require additional hardware equipment
   with high cost at the level of small and medium companies. This paper
   proposes a multi-factor authentication system that combines ease of use
   and low-cost factors. The system does not need any special settings or
   infrastructure. It relies on graphical passwords, so the user, in
   registration phase, chooses three images and memorizes them. In the
   login phase, the user needs only to choose the correct images that he
   considered during the registration process in a specific order. The
   proposed system overcomes many different security threats, such as
   key-loggers, screen capture attack or shoulder surfing. The proposed
   method was applied to 170 participants, 75\% of them are males and 25\%
   are females, classified according to their age, education level, web
   experience. One-third of them did not have sufficient knowledge about
   various security threats.},

Abstract = {Phishing email attacks have been around for fifteen years but they are
   still among the top security risks faced by organisations. The most
   common approach to mitigate these attacks is employees' education and
   awareness. Employees' awareness on phishing attacks is achieved by
   embedded training that educate employees when they fall for the attack.
   However, the effectiveness of embedded training in workplace settings is
   uncertain given the large number of employees that remain vulnerable to
   phishing email attacks. Similarly, the role of persuasion techniques in
   making employees vulnerable to phishing attacks is yet to be
   investigated in the workplace settings. Therefore, in this paper we
   investigate which persuasion technique between authority and urgency is
   more effective in making employees susceptible to phishing, the relation
   between employees' susceptibility and their demographic data, and the
   effectiveness of embedded training in reducing employees' susceptibility
   to phishing attacks. To this end, we conducted a real phishing study
   with 191 employees of an Italian company. We found that employees were
   more vulnerable to phishing attacks when urgency principle was
   exploited. The study also showed no significant effect of employees'
   demographic data on susceptibility to phishing. Embedded training was
   perceived as effective by employees but it did not reduce their
   susceptibility to phishing.},

Abstract = {Electronic mail services have become an important source of
   communication for millions of people all over the world. Due to this
   tremendous growth, there has been a significant increase in spam
   traffic. Spam messes up user's inbox, consumes network resources and
   spread worms and viruses. In this paper we study the characteristics of
   spam and the technology used by spammers. In order to counter anti spam
   technology, spammers change their mode of operation, therefore continues
   evaluation of the characteristics of spam and spammers technology has
   become mandatory. These evaluations help us to enhance the existing anti
   spam technology and thereby help us to combat spam effectively. In order
   to characterize spam, we collected four hundred thousand spam mails from
   a corporate mail server for a period of 14 months from January 2006 to
   February 2007. For analysis we classified spam based on attachment and
   contents. We observed that spammers use software tools to send spam with
   attachment. The main features of this software are hiding sender's
   identity, randomly selecting text messages, identifying open relay
   machines, mass mailing capability and defining spamming duration.
   Spammers do not use spam software to send spam without attachment. From
   our study we observed that, four years old heavy users email accounts
   attract more spam than four years old light users mail accounts.
   Relatively new email accounts which are 14 months old do not receive
   spam. But in some special cases like DDoS attacks, we found that new
   email accounts receive spam and 14 months old heavy users email accounts
   have attracted more spam than 14 months old light users. We believe that
   this analysis could be useful to develop more efficient anti spam
   techniques.},

Title = {The detection and management of attempted fraud during an online
   randomised trial},
Journal = {TRIALS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 4},
Abstract = {BackgroundOnline studies offer an efficient method of recruiting
   participants and collecting data. Whilst delivering an online randomised
   trial, we detected unusual recruitment activity. We describe our
   approach to detecting and managing suspected fraud and share lessons for
   researchers.MethodsOur trial investigated the single and combined
   effects of different ways of presenting clinical audit and feedback.
   Clinicians and managers who received feedback from one of five United
   Kingdom national clinical audit programmes were emailed invitations that
   contained a link to the trial website. After providing consent and
   selecting their relevant audit, participants were randomised
   automatically to different feedback versions. Immediately after viewing
   their assigned feedback, participants completed a questionnaire and
   could request a financial voucher by entering an email address. Email
   addresses were not linked to trial data to preserve participant
   anonymity. We actively monitored participant numbers, questionnaire
   completions, and voucher claims.ResultsFollowing a rapid increase in
   trial participation, we identified 268 new voucher claims from three
   email addresses that we had reason to believe were linked. Further
   scrutiny revealed duplicate trial completions and voucher requests from
   24 email addresses. We immediately suspended the trial, improved
   security measures, and went on to successfully complete the study.We
   found a peak in questionnaires completed in less than 20 seconds during
   a likely contamination period. Given that study and personal data were
   not linked, we could not directly identify the trial data from the 268
   duplicate entries within the 603 randomisations occurring during the
   same period. We therefore excluded all 603 randomisations from the
   primary analysis, which was consequently based on 638 randomisations. A
   sensitivity analysis, including all 961 randomisations over the entire
   study except for questionnaire completions of less than 20 seconds,
   found only minor differences from the primary analysis.ConclusionOnline
   studies offering incentives for participation are at risk of attempted
   fraud. Systematic monitoring and analysis can help detect such activity.
   Measures to protect study integrity include linking participant
   identifiers to study data, balancing study security and ease of
   participation, and safeguarding the allocation of participant
   incentives.},

Abstract = {Identity-based encryption (IBE) is an important primitive of
   identity-based cryptography. As such it is a type of public-key
   encryption in which the public key of a user is some unique information
   about the identity of the user (e.g. a user's email address).
   Hierarchical identity-based encryption (HIBE) provides more
   functionality by forming levels of an organizational hierarchy. A user
   can delegate secret keys to descendant identities at lower levels, but
   cannot decrypt messages intended for a recipient that is not among its
   descendants.
   In this paper, we construct a new HIBE scheme in a generic ``leveled{''}
   multilinear map setting and prove its security under multilinear
   decisional Diffie-Hellmanin assumption in the selective-ID model.},

Abstract = {User authentication remains a challenging issue, despite the existence
   of a large number of proposed solutions, such as traditional text-based,
   graphical-based, biometrics-based, Web-based, and hardware-based
   schemes. For example, some of these schemes are not suitable for
   deployment in an Internet of Things (IoT) setting, partly due to the
   hardware and/or software constraints of IoT devices. The increasing
   popularity and pervasiveness of IoT equipment in a broad range of
   settings reinforces the importance of ensuring the security and privacy
   of IoT devices. Therefore, in this article, we conduct a comprehensive
   literature review and an empirical study to gain an in-depth
   understanding of the different authentication schemes as well as their
   vulnerabilities and deficits against various types of cyberattacks when
   applied in IoT-based systems. Based on the identified limitations, we
   recommend several mitigation strategies and discuss the practical
   implications of our findings.},

Abstract = {In a previous study, the researchers presented the Dynamic Password
   Authentication that was designed with an uncomplicated algorithm so it
   was applicable for several platforms, e.g., web application, network
   device, and mobile application. This Dynamic Password Authentication was
   practically implemented and the system analysis was discussed in terms
   of security, speed, and ease of use by comparing it with the Cisco CHAP
   authentication.
   Differently, this study presented an integration of the Dynamic Password
   Authentication with a possession factor and CAPTCHA to make the system
   more secured by typically focusing on creating a shortest, fastest, and
   simplest process. On this matter, we tried out with user's e-mail as the
   possession factor since there was a low rate of errors than using a
   mobile phone that could be broken, lost, or replaced more often than the
   e-mail. Meanwhile, a CAPTCHA question was taken by clicking the link in
   the email that offered a better security than presenting the CAPTCHA
   question directly on a log-in page. In fact, this paper presented the
   model and the system analysis to point out different benefits of the
   proposed authentication system.},

Journal = {PHARMACY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This study applied a human factors and ergonomics approach to describe
   community-based pharmacy personnel perspectives regarding how work
   environment characteristics affect the ability to perform the duties
   necessary for optimal patient care and how contributors to stress affect
   the ability to ensure patient safety. Data were obtained from the 2021
   APhA/NASPA National State-Based Pharmacy Workplace Survey, launched in
   the United States in April 2021. Promotion of the online survey to
   pharmacists and pharmacy technicians was accomplished through social
   media, email, and online periodicals. Responses continued to be received
   through the end of 2021. A data file containing 6973 responses was
   downloaded on 7 January 2022 for analysis. Qualitative thematic analysis
   was applied for developing operational definitions and coding guidelines
   for content analysis of the data. The patterns of responses for the
   dependent variables were compared among community-based practice setting
   types (chain, supermarket/mass merchandiser, and independent) and work
   positions (manager, staff pharmacist, technician/clerk, and owner).
   Chi-square analysis was used for determining statistically significant
   differences. The findings showed that personnel working in
   community-based pharmacies reported undesirable work environments and
   work stress that affected their ability to perform assigned duties for
   optimal patient care and ensure patient safety. Four work system
   elements were identified that were both facilitators and barriers to the
   ability to perform duties and ensure patient safety: (1) people, (2)
   tasks, (3) technology/tools, and (4) organizational context.
   Acknowledging local contexts of workplaces, giving adequate control,
   applying adaptive thinking, enhancing connectivity, building on existing
   mechanisms, and dynamic continuous learning are key elements for
   applying the HFE (human factors ergonomics) approach to improving the
   experience of providing care in community-based pharmacies.},

Abstract = {A Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans
   Apart is a test use to determine whether the user is a human or a
   malicious computer program. In simple terms CAPTCHA is a program that
   can generate and grade tests that most humans can pass, yet current
   computer programs can't pass. They can be found as blurred or distorted
   random images, in free email signups, online polls or commenting on
   blogs; these images are difficult to recognize by computer programs but
   easy for most humans. They work as basic tool for preventing Denial of
   Service, brute force attacks and advertising spams. CAPTCHAs have
   evolved from simple text based to recent advancements like audio and
   visual tests. Text based CAPTCHAs have been broken successfully with the
   help of Optical Character Recognition and every approach is vulnerable
   against laundry attacks or redirection. The suggested approach `Drag and
   Drop CAPTCHA' or `DnD' is inclusive solution against OCR and laundry
   attacks. This HIP challenge uses conventional mouse events to recognize
   human intervention proof. If an attacker computer knows the answer of
   test but it can't pass this test without human intervention. This
   technique can be considered as an Artificial Intelligence challenge. It
   creates win-win situation either this tough AI problem gets solved or
   DnD technique is distinction tool for human \& computers.},

Title = {Personal Information Classification on Aggregated Android Application's
   Permissions},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2019},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Android is offering millions of apps on Google Play-store by the
   application publishers. However, those publishers do have a parent
   organization and share information with them. Through the `Android
   permission system', a user permits an app to access sensitive personal
   data. Large-scale personal data integration can reveal user identity,
   enabling new insights and earn revenue for the organizations. Similarly,
   aggregation of Android app permissions by the app owning parent
   organizations can also cause privacy leakage by revealing the user
   profile. This work classifies risky personal data by proposing a threat
   model on the large-scale app permission aggregation by the app
   publishers and associated owners. A Google-play application programming
   interface (API) assisted web app is developed that visualizes all the
   permissions an app owner can collectively gather through multiple apps
   released via several publishers. The work empirically validates the
   performance of the risk model with two case studies. The top two Korean
   app owners, seven publishers, 108 apps and 720 sets of permissions are
   studied. With reasonable accuracy, the study finds the contact number,
   biometric ID, address, social graph, human behavior, email, location and
   unique ID as frequently exposed data. Finally, the work concludes that
   the real-time tracking of aggregated permissions can limit the odds of
   user profiling.},

Abstract = {The evolution of Flying Ad-hoc Networks (FANETs) marks the paradigm
   shift from a single large drone to multiple small drones linked together
   in an ad-hoc fashion. To maintain the Quality of Service (QoS) in the
   multi-hop networking schema, FANETs utilize the available resources
   efficiently. However, due to open wireless boundary and high mobility of
   the drones, the FANETs are vulnerable to malicious nodes that can
   penetrate the network and, thus, pose serious security threats,
   particularly at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. Such
   susceptibility compromises the network security and privacy and harms
   the information exchange operation within the network. The attacker can
   either transmit a large number of reservation requests to waste the
   bandwidth, listen to the control messages, conduct power-efficient
   jamming or falsify the information to manipulate the network control.
   Therefore, secure access control and a key agreement mechanism are
   required. The mechanism must utilize the two phases, i.e., node
   authentication and key agreement, to counter the aforementioned attacks.
   Our contribution, in this paper, is a certificate-based access control
   and key agreement scheme, which is based on the technique of
   Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography (HECC) and employs a
   collision-resistant one-way cryptographic hash function. In order to
   assess the viability and performance of the proposed scheme, we analyze
   it using formal security analysis techniques, such as the Real-Or-Random
   (ROR) model and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and
   Applications (AVISPA) tool. The scheme is also evaluated using the
   informal security analysis technique, or the non-mathematical approach.
   The results obtained from both analyses affirm the superiority of our
   proposed scheme.},

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY},
Year = {2025},

Abstract = {Password-based threshold single-sign-on authentication (PbTA) allows
   multiple identity servers to in a threshold manner authenticate a user
   and issue a token, with which the user accesses relevant services. We
   analyze existing PbTA schemes and reveal a potential threat:
   vulnerability against perpetual credential leakage, in which
   ``perpetual{''} adversaries could perpetually attempt to compromise
   long-lived credential databases maintained by identity servers.
   Compromising a threshold number of credential databases enables the
   adversaries to launch offline dictionary guessing attacks (DGA) or
   illegally obtain users' tokens. To address these issues, we first
   propose a basic device-enhanced PbTA scheme (DE-PbTA), where an
   auxiliary device collaborates with identity servers in hardening a
   user's password during authentication, such that perpetual adversaries
   cannot learn the password from compromised credentials via offline DGA.
   Using the hardened password, a private key can be derived to decrypt
   ciphertexts from identity servers for token construction, which protects
   the user's tokens against perpetual adversaries. Then, we extend basic
   DE-PbTA to support dynamic usage of multiple devices, where a user can
   actively choose t' devices out of n' for authentication. Provable
   security and high efficiency of the basic/enhanced DE-PbTA scheme are
   demonstrated by comprehensive analysis and experimental evaluations.},

Abstract = {If a web service is so secure that it does not even know- and does not
   want to know-the identity and contact info of its users, can it still
   offer account recovery if a user forgets their password? This paper is
   the culmination of the authors' work to design a cryptographic protocol
   for account recovery for use by a prominent secure matching system: a
   web-based service that allows survivors of sexual misconduct to become
   aware of other survivors harmed by the same perpetrator. In such a
   system, the list of account-holders must be safeguarded, even against
   the service provider itself.
   In this work, we design an account recovery system that, on the surface,
   appears to follow the typical workflow: the user types in their email
   address, receives an email containing a one-time link, and answers some
   security questions. Behind the scenes, the defining feature of our
   recovery system is that the service provider can perform email-based
   account validation without knowing, or being able to learn, a list of
   users' email addresses. Our construction uses standardized cryptography
   for most components, and it has been deployed in production at the
   secure matching system.
   As a building block toward our main construction, we design a new
   cryptographic primitive that may be of independent interest: an
   oblivious pseudorandom function that can either have a fully-private
   input or a partially-public input, and that reaches the same output
   either way. This primitive allows us to perform online rate limiting for
   account recovery attempts, without imposing a bound on the creation of
   new accounts. We provide an open-source implementation of this primitive
   and provide evaluation results showing that the end-to-end interaction
   time takes 8.4-60.4 ms in fully-private input mode and 3.1-41.2 ms in
   partially-public input mode.},

Abstract = {Smart glasses are becoming popular for users to access various services
   such as email. To protect these services, password-based user
   authentication is widely used. Unfortunately, the password-based user
   authentication has inherent vulnerability against password leakage. Many
   efforts have been put on designing leakage-resilient password entry
   schemes on PCs and mobile phones with traditional input equipment
   including keyboards and touch screens. However, such traditional input
   equipment is not available on smart glasses. Existing password entry on
   smart glasses relies on additional PCs or mobile devices. Such solutions
   force users to switch between different systems, which causes
   interrupted experience and may lower the practicability and usability of
   smart glasses. In this paper, we propose a series of leakage-resilient
   password entry schemes on stand-alone smart glasses, which are gTapper,
   gRotator, and gTalker. These schemes ensure no leakage in password entry
   by breaking the correlation between the underlying password and the
   interaction observable to adversaries. They are practical in the sense
   that they only require a touch pad, a gyroscope, and a microphone which
   are commonly available on smart glasses. The usability of the proposed
   schemes is evaluated by user study under various test conditions which
   are common in users' daily usage. The results of our user study reveal
   that the proposed schemes are easy-to-use so that users enter their
   passwords within moderate time, at high accuracy, and in various
   situations.},

Abstract = {Toxicology and safety assessment are changing and require new strategies
   for evaluating risk that are less depending on apical toxicity endpoints
   in animal models and relying more on knowledge of the mechanism of
   toxicity. This manuscript describes a number of developments that could
   contribute to this change and implement this in a stepwise roadmap that
   can be applied for the evaluation of food and food ingredients.
   The roadmap was evaluated in four case studies by using literature and
   existing data. This preliminary evaluation was shown to be useful.
   However, this experience should be extended by including examples where
   experimental work needs to be included. To further implement these new
   insights in toxicology and safety assessment for the area of food and
   food ingredients, the recommendation is that stakeholders take action in
   addressing gaps in our knowledge, e.g. with regard to the applicability
   of the roadmap for mixtures and food matrices. Further development of
   the threshold of toxicological concern is needed, as well as cooperation
   with other sectors where similar schemes are under development.
   Moreover, a more comprehensive evaluation of the roadmap, also including
   the identification of the need for in vitro experimental work is
   recommended. (C) 2016 ILSI Europe. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Evaluating the applicability of the double system lens model to the
   analysis of phishing email judgments},

Abstract = {Phishing emails pose a serious threat to cybersecurity. Because human
   users are the last line of defense, understanding how users identify
   phishing emails is imperative to addressing this problem. Judgment
   analysis (JA) provides a means of analyzing both how information in the
   environment (cues) contributes to an outcome and how users synthesize
   cues into judgments about that outcome, typically using multiple linear
   regression. Because JA has not been applied to this domain, this effort
   assessed if the statistical assumptions of JA with multiple linear
   regression are upheld. We hypothesized that phishing cues are linearly
   combinable, meaning a lens model analysis, a type of JA, is appropriate
   for evaluating phishing judgments. To test this, we analyzed ten
   participants who judged whether or not emails were phishing using the
   double system lens model. Results indicated that the lens model is an
   appropriate means of analyzing phishing judgments, primarily evidenced
   by the goodness of fits for both the environment model and human
   judgment models. We also observed varying achievement scores across
   participants consistent with their varying levels of performance in the
   judgment task. We discuss our results and how future phishing judgment
   research can utilize JA afforded analysis capabilities. (C) 2018

Title = {Using digital tools in the recruitment and retention in randomised
   controlled trials: survey of UK Clinical Trial Units and a qualitative
   study},
Journal = {TRIALS},

Abstract = {Background Recruitment and retention of participants in randomised
   controlled trials (RCTs) is a key determinant of success but is
   challenging. Trialists and UK Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC)
   Clinical Trials Units (CTUs) are increasingly exploring the use of
   digital tools to identify, recruit and retain participants. The aim of
   this UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) study was to
   identify what digital tools are currently used by CTUs and understand
   the performance characteristics required to be judged useful. Methods A
   scoping of searches (and a survey with NIHR funding staff), a survey
   with all 52 UKCRC CTUs and 16 qualitative interviews were conducted with
   five stakeholder groups including trialists within CTUs, funders and
   research participants. A purposive sampling approach was used to conduct
   the qualitative interviews during March-June 2018. Qualitative data were
   analysed using a content analysis and inductive approach. Results
   Responses from 24 (46\%) CTUs identified that database-screening tools
   were the most widely used digital tool for recruitment, with the
   majority being considered effective. The reason (and to whom) these
   tools were considered effective was in identifying potential
   participants (for both Site staff and CTU staff) and reaching
   recruitment target (for CTU staff/CI). Fewer retention tools were used,
   with short message service (SMS) or email reminders to participants
   being the most reported. The qualitative interviews revealed five themes
   across all groups: `security and transparency'; `inclusivity and
   engagement'; `human interaction'; `obstacles and risks'; and `potential
   benefits'. There was a high level of stakeholder acceptance of the use
   of digital tools to support trials, despite the lack of evidence to
   support them over more traditional techniques. Certain differences and
   similarities between stakeholder groups demonstrated the complexity and
   challenges of using digital tools for recruiting and retaining research
   participants. Conclusions Our studies identified a range of digital
   tools in use in recruitment and retention of RCTs, despite the lack of
   high-quality evidence to support their use. Understanding the type of
   digital tools in use to support recruitment and retention will help to
   inform funders and the wider research community about their value and
   relevance for future RCTs. Consideration of further focused digital tool
   reviews and primary research will help to reduce gaps in the evidence
   base.},

Abstract = {Phishing requires humans to fall for impersonated sources. Sender
   authenticity can often be inferred from e-mail header information
   commonly displayed by e-mail clients, such as sender and recipient
   details. People may be biased by convincing e-mail content and overlook
   these details, and subsequently fall for phishing. This study tests
   whether people are better at detecting phishing e-mails when they are
   only presented with user-facing e-mail headers, instead of full e-mails.
   Results from a representative sample show that most phishing e-mails
   were detected by less than 30\% of the participants, regardless of which
   e-mail part was displayed. In fact, phishing detection was worst when
   only e-mail headers were provided. Thus, people still fall for phishing,
   because they do not recognize online impersonation tactics. No personal
   traits, e-mail characteristics, nor URL interactions reliably predicted
   phishing detection abilities. These findings highlight the need for
   novel approaches to help users with evaluating e-mail authenticity.},

Abstract = {Due to the existence of security threats in the cloud, many mechanisms
   have been proposed to allow a user to audit data integrity with the
   public key of the data owner before utilizing cloud data. The
   correctness of choosing the right public key in previous mechanisms
   depends on the security of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and
   certificates. Although traditional PKI has been widely used in the
   construction of public key cryptography, it still faces many security
   risks, especially in the aspect of managing certificates. In this paper,
   we design a certificateless public auditing mechanism to eliminate the
   security risks introduced by PKI in previous solutions. Specifically,
   with our mechanism, a public verifier does not need to manage
   certificates to choose the right public key for the auditing. Instead,
   the auditing can be operated with the assistance of the data owner's
   identity, such as her name or email address, which can ensure the right
   public key is used. Meanwhile, this public verifier is still able to
   audit data integrity without retrieving the entire data from the cloud
   as previous solutions. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first
   certificateless public auditing mechanism for verifying data integrity
   in the cloud. Our theoretical analyses prove that our mechanism is
   correct and secure, and our experimental results show that our mechanism
   is able to audit the integrity of data in the cloud efficiently.},

Abstract = {For increasing Internet of Things (IoT) devices, 6G wireless technology
   aims for ubiquitous communications in which positioning services are
   necessary. Private spatial keyword-based positioning service is
   promising in 6G-oriented IoT since it positions users based on spatial
   locations and textual keywords while protecting user privacy. However,
   due to economic benefits or malicious attacks, positioning service
   providers may return erroneous or incomplete results, which cause
   tremendous economic damage and security threats, e.g., always assigning
   a selective driver for the specific car-hailing user. A technical
   challenge for extending existing private schemes to enable users to
   verify the correctness and completeness of positioning results is the
   distinctive positioning paradigm between compared spatial locations and
   matched textual keywords. This paper proposes a private and verifiable
   spatial keyword positioning scheme named VSpatial in 6G-oriented IoT.
   VSpatial enables users to verify the correctness and completeness of
   spatial keyword-based positioning results while preserving user privacy.
   The main inspiration for addressing the technical challenge is
   converting both spatial locations and textual keywords into an internal
   status, i.e., adapting comparison and matching to existence judging by
   multiple cryptographic tools, such as hierarchical cube and pseudorandom
   function. Based on this inspiration, we design a novel private
   authenticated data structure (named PVTree), and then propose two
   constructions of VSpatial, i.e., VSpatial-S and VSpatial-D, to suit
   static and dynamic environments, respectively. The core idea for
   adapting VSpatial-S to VSpatial-D is transferring one whole PVTree into
   multiple exponential-size partitions. Security analysis proves the
   security and verifiability of VSpatial. Theoretical and experimental
   evaluations show that VSpatial achieves faster-than-linear positioning
   efficiency and linear verification overhead.},

Abstract = {Login notifications intend to inform users about sign-ins and help them
   protect their accounts from unauthorized access. Notifications are
   usually sent if a login deviates from previous ones, potentially
   indicating malicious activity. They contain information like the
   location, date, time, and device used to sign in. Users are challenged
   to verify whether they recognize the login (because it was them or
   someone they know) or to protect their account from unwanted access. In
   a user study, we explore users' comprehension, reactions, and
   expectations of login notifications. We utilize two treatments to
   measure users' behavior in response to notifications sent for a login
   they initiated or based on a malicious actor relying on statistical
   sign-in information. We find that users identify legitimate logins but
   need more support to halt malicious sign-ins. We discuss the identified
   problems and give recommendations for service providers to ensure usable
   and secure logins for everyone.},

Abstract = {In recent days, web searching and security of the archives plays most
   incredible progress. The enduring research prototypes many web search
   show the result by searching the relevant data alone. Due to the mere
   relevancy search, the users may loss some useful data which are not
   included in the search result. Moreover, it also may consume more time
   by searching the data sequentially. To overcome these challenges
   stemming process is united with the existing model for searching the
   both labelled and unlabelled documents. Furthermore, User Based
   Advertisement (UBA) is included with the proposed search engine to
   display the advertisements based on search. To improve the ranking
   system, Time Stamp Based Analysis (TSBA) is incorporated in the process
   for easy search of users. With these improvementsduring the
   searchprocess inkeyword search and posting the comments in the link any
   offensive words are used it will give the alert to remove the word.
   whiledownloading one's file that are uploaded in the web search become
   quite easy. But security is a major concern sending a request for
   downloading a data. In order to overcome this difficulty, Email OTP
   Alert (EOTPA) is provided in the proposed model to increase the security
   in web search.},

Title = {Randomized controlled trial evaluating an intervention supporting

   schools},
Journal = {PREVENTIVE MEDICINE},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Solar ultraviolet radiation (UV) exposure is the primary risk factor for
   skin cancer and children receive about one-quarter of lifetime UV
   exposure before age 18. Thus, skin cancer prevention is essential for
   children. The objective of this study was to test an intervention to
   facilitate implementation of district sun safety policies. Elementary
   schools (N = 118) from 40 California public school districts with a
   school board-approved policy for sun safety were recruited along with
   one principal and teacher from each school. Elementary schools were
   randomly assigned to receive the 20-month Sun Safe Schools intervention
   (N = 58) or to a minimal informational control condition (N = 60).
   Principals were 47.8 and teachers 44.3 years of age and were
   predominately female (principals 72.7\%; teachers 86.7\%) and White
   (principals 72.0\%; teachers 68.2\%). The 20-month Sun Safe Schools
   intervention was delivered to principals and included a coaching
   session, telephone and email contacts, provision of resources for
   practice implementation, and a small grant program. The principal (N =
   118) and a teacher (N = 113) at each school reported on school sun
   protection practices 20-months post-baseline. The schools were diverse
   in student characteristics (M = 64.1\% free/reduced price meals; M =
   54.5\% Hispanic). Intervention principals reported implementing more sun
   safety practices overall (control M = 2.7, intervention M = 4.2, p <
   .005) and more practices not present in the district's policy (control M
   = 0.4, intervention M = 0.9, p = .005). Principals and teachers combined
   replicated these findings and also reported implementing more practices
   present in the district policy (control M = 0.9, intervention M = 1.3, p
   = .005). In sum, the intervention increased sun safety practices in
   public elementary schools.},

Abstract = {Accurate information is vital for countering misinformation, enabling
   informed decisions, and shaping societal outcomes. Many studies explore
   various methods of fake news detection. Yet, no effort has been made to
   systematically review existing notification systems that alert users to
   fake news in the advocacy of accurate information. This advocacy
   empowers individuals to discern truth, fosters accountability, and
   safeguards democratic values. This paper presents our synthesis review
   study, conducted through the Systematic Literature Review (SLR)
   methodology, to assess the existing notification systems employed in
   various use cases, addressing this gap, and identifying research
   opportunities in alerting users to fake news. This study focuses on four
   primary technologies: cell broadcast, short message system, mobile
   notification, and email notification. Our study found that content
   challenges, frequency, communication, security, and reliability provided
   opportunities for content sufficiency, personalization with privacy
   considerations, and enhanced safety. The results of this study present a
   consolidated view of current notification systems for future
   interventions in employing methods of alerting users to fake news and
   identifying potential research opportunities.},

Abstract = {Identity-based Signatures (IBS) are a form of digital signature scheme
   that enables the generation and verification of signatures based on a
   user's identity, such as an email address, social security number, or
   any other unique identifier. Recent advancements in post-quantum
   cryptography have further strengthened IBS schemes, making them
   resilient against quantum computing threats and ensuring their
   applicability in future secure communications. At ProvSec'21, Shaw and
   Dutta introduced an identity-based signature obtained from the
   isogeny-based signature scheme CSI-FiSh by Beullens et al. at
   ASIACRYPT'19. Later, at PQCrypto'23, Chen et al. proposed a tightly
   secure IBS by utilising the tightly secure variant of CSI -FiSh, called
   Lossy CSI -FiSh, by Kaafarani et al. at PKC'20.
   In this paper, we generalise those results to obtain a framework for
   constructing an IBS scheme from cryptographic (non-abelian) group
   actions. Under the pseudorandom assumption of underlying group actions,
   we prove that our IBS is tightly secure in the random oracle model.
   Moreover, we also generalise a Forward-Secure Identity-based Signature
   (FSIBS) scheme from group actions. This scheme ensures past signatures
   remain unforgeable even if the current signing key is compromised. Our
   schemes can be instantiated from existing NIST's post-quantum signature
   candidates such as MEDS, LESS and ALTEQ.},

Abstract = {After treating the notification of vulnerable parties as mere side-notes
   in research, the security community has recently put more focus on how
   to conduct vulnerability disclosure at scale. The first works in this
   area have shown that while notifications are helpful to a significant
   fraction of operators, the vast majority of systems remain unpatched. In
   this paper, we build on these previous works, aiming to understand why
   the effects are not more significant. To that end, we report on a
   notification experiment targeting more than 24,000 domains, which
   allowed us to analyze what technical and human aspects are roadblocks to
   a successful campaign. As part of this experiment, we explored potential
   alternative notification channels beyond email, including social media
   and phone. In addition, we conducted an anonymous survey with the
   notified operators, investigating their perspectives on our
   notifications. We show the pitfalls of email-based communications, such
   as the impact of anti-spam filters, the lack of trust by recipients, and
   the hesitation in fixing vulnerabilities despite awareness. However, our
   exploration of alternative communication channels did not suggest a more
   promising medium. Seeing these results, we pinpoint future directions in
   improving security notifications.},

Abstract = {Instead of allowing the recovery of original passwords, forgotten
   passwords are often reset using online mechanisms such as password
   verification questions (PVQ methods) and password reset links in email.
   These mechanisms are generally weak, exploitable, and force users to
   choose new passwords. Emailing the original password exposes the
   password to third parties. To address these issues, and to allow
   forgotten passwords to be securely restored, we present a scheme called
   Mercury. Its primary mode employs user-level public keys and a personal
   mobile device (PMD) such as a smart-phone, netbook, or tablet. A user
   generates a key pair on her PMD; the private key remains on the PMD and
   the public key is shared with different sites (e.g., during account
   setup). For password recovery, the site sends the (public key)-encrypted
   password to the user's pre-registered email address, or displays the
   encrypted password on a webpage, e.g., as a barcode. The encrypted
   password is then decrypted using the PMD and revealed to the user. A
   prototype implementation of Mercury is available as an Android
   application.},

Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to propose a research model integrating
   technology acceptance model 3 (TAM3) constructs and human aspects of
   humanoid service robots (HSRs), measured by the Godspeed questionnaire
   series and tested across two hotel properties in Japan and the USA.
   Design/methodology/approachPotential participants were approached
   randomly by email invitation. A final sample size of 395 across two
   hotels, one in Japan and the other in the USA, was obtained, and the
   data were analysed using structural equation modelling. FindingsThe
   results confirm that perceived usefulness, driven by subjective norms
   and output quality, and perceived ease of use, driven by perceived
   enjoyment and absence of anxiety, are the immediate direct determinants
   of users' re-patronage intentions for HSRs. Results also showed that
   users prefer anthropomorphism, perceived intelligence and the safety of
   an HSR for reusing it. Practical implicationsThe findings have practical
   implications for the hospitality industry, suggesting multiple
   attributes of an HSRs that managers need to consider before deploying
   them in their properties. Originality/valueThe current study proposes an
   integrated model determining factors that affect the re-patronage of
   HSRs in hotels.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, cloud computing has become an emerging and widely used
   technology throughout the world on account of its dynamic, reliable and
   customizable quality of service. However, at the same time, the security
   problem of cloud environment is attracted more and more attentions from
   academia and industry. In many concerns regarding cloud computing
   security, the digital forensic is a hot topic. Compared with traditional
   digital forensic on common digital devices and hardware, it is difficult
   to implement digital forensic in cloud because it is very hard to
   collect logs from cloud environment. In this paper, we try to design a
   new system to address the issue of digital forensic in cloud
   environment. We use a new architecture to help investigators performing
   the log collection. Firstly, a Host-based Intrusion Detection System
   (HIDS) is introduced to secure the data in cloud from malicious attacks
   of intruders. Then, based on the feedback results of HIDS, one web
   server generates email alerts and Secure Shell (SSH) message to restrict
   further suspicious activities. Finally, the digital forensic
   investigators can collect reliable evidence of suspected user. In this
   way, HIDS and log collection will be significant part for digital
   forensic in cloud environment.},

Journal = {COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR},

Abstract = {Phishing attacks are more common and more sophisticated than other forms
   of social engineering attacks. This study presents an investigation of
   the relationships between three personality traits Machiavellianism,
   narcissism, and psychopathy (i.e., the Dark Triad) and phishing effort,
   attack success, and end-user susceptibility to phishing emails.
   Participants were recruited in two stages. The first set of participants
   acted as attackers, creating phishing emails. The second set of
   participants acted as end-users, reading both benevolent and phishing
   emails and indicating their likely behavioral response to each email.
   Our findings suggest that attackers' Dark Triad scores relate to the
   effort that they put in writing a phishing email, but do not predict
   phishing success. Instead, it is the end-users' Dark Triad scores that
   predict the success of phishing emails. We found that higher levels of
   attacker Machiavellianism were linked to increased phishing effort,
   while end-user narcissism was associated to greater vulnerability when
   receiving phishing emails. Furthermore, our findings suggest that
   narcissistic end-users were marginally more susceptible to phishing
   emails that originated from narcissistic attackers. These results have
   important practical implications for training, anti-phishing tool
   development, and policy in organizations.},

Abstract = {Despite the prevalence of data breaches, there is a limited
   understanding of individuals' awareness, perception, and responses to
   breaches that affect them. We provide novel insights into this topic
   through an online study (n=413) in which we presented participants with
   up to three data breaches that had exposed their email addresses and
   other personal information. Overall, 73\% of participants were affected
   by at least one breach, 5.36 breaches on average. Many participants
   attributed the cause of being affected by a breach to their poor email
   and security practices; only 14\% correctly attributed the cause to
   external factors such as breached organizations and hackers.
   Participants were unaware of 74\% of displayed breaches and expressed
   various emotions when learning about them. While some reported intending
   to take action, most participants believed the breach would not impact
   them. Our findings underline the need for user-friendly tools to improve
   consumers' resilience against breaches and accountability for breached
   organizations to provide more proactive post-breach communications and
   mitigations.},

Abstract = {With the developing digital era, the users are more vulnerable to
   various types of security threats such as Phishing(RAT), a serious
   security threat to the internet users in which the intruder sends an
   email which looks legitimate, where the RATs are usually downloaded
   invisibly with a user requested program such as game or in this case an
   email attachment. RATs provide a backdoor for administrative control
   over the targeted computer, from which the intruder will be allowed to
   access all sensitive and confidential data such as banking application,
   which needs more security. It is important to prevent such phishing
   attacks. One of the ways to prevent the password theft is to
   authenticate a user without the use of the text password. In this paper
   we propose an idea which eliminates the use of the permanent text
   passwords, by authenticating the user through image based password.
   After image based authentication, the user will obtain the One Time
   Password (OTP) using the messaging service available in the internet.
   The image based authentication method relies on the user's ability to
   recognize the pre-chosen images from a grid of pictures which appears in
   a random manner. This paper integrates One time Image password based
   authentication and HMAC based one time password and to achieve high
   level of security in authenticating the user and these algorithms are
   very economical to implement},

Abstract = {The concepts of Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber Physical Systems
   (CPS) are closely related to each other. IoT is often used to refer to
   small interconnected devices like those in smart home while CPS often
   refers to large interconnected devices like industry machines and smart
   cars. In this paper, we present a unified view of IoT and CPS: from the
   perspective of network architecture, IoT and CPS are similar given that
   they are based on either the OSI model or TCP/IP model. In both IoT and
   CPS, networking/communication modules are attached to original things so
   that isolated things can be integrated into cyber space. If needed,
   actuators can also be integrated with a thing so as to control the
   thing. With this unified view, we can perform risk assessment of an
   IoT/CPS system from six factors, hardware, networking, operating system
   (OS), software, data and human. To illustrate the use of such risk
   analysis framework, we analyze an air quality monitoring network, smart
   home using smart plugs and building automation system (BAS). We also
   discuss challenges such as cost and secure OS in IoT security.},

Title = {Lateral Phishing With Large Language Models: A Large Organization
   Comparative Study},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {60684-60701},
Abstract = {The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened the threat
   of phishing emails by enabling the generation of highly targeted,
   personalized, and automated attacks. Traditionally, many phishing emails
   have been characterized by typos, errors, and poor language. These
   errors can be mitigated by LLMs, potentially lowering the barrier for
   attackers. Despite this, there is a lack of large-scale studies
   comparing the effectiveness of LLM-generated lateral phishing emails to
   those crafted by humans. Current literature does not adequately address
   the comparative effectiveness of LLM and human-generated lateral
   phishing emails in a real-world, large-scale organizational setting,
   especially considering the potential for LLMs to generate more
   convincing and error-free phishing content. To address this gap, we
   conducted a pioneering study within a large university, targeting its
   workforce of approximately 9,000 individuals including faculty, staff,
   administrators, and student workers. Our results indicate that
   LLM-generated lateral phishing emails are as effective as those written
   by communications professionals, emphasizing the critical threat posed
   by LLMs in leading phishing campaigns. We break down the results of the
   overall phishing experiment, comparing vulnerability between departments
   and job roles. Furthermore, to gather qualitative data, we administered
   a detailed questionnaire, revealing insights into the reasons and
   motivations behind vulnerable employee's actions. This study contributes
   to the understanding of cyber security threats in educational
   institutions and provides a comprehensive comparison of LLM and
   human-generated phishing emails' effectiveness, considering the
   potential for LLMs to generate more convincing content. The findings
   highlight the need for enhanced user education and system defenses to
   mitigate the growing threat of AI-powered phishing attacks.},

Abstract = {Phishing is a rapidly growing threat in cyber world and causing billions
   of dollars in damage every year to internet users. It is an unlawful
   activity which uses a group of social engineering and technology to
   collect an Internet user's sensitive information. The identification of
   phishing techniques can be performed in various methods of
   communications like email, instant messages, pop-up messages, or at web
   page level. Over the period, a number of research articles have
   published with different techniques and procedures but have failed to
   detect all associated risks and provide a comprehensive solution. This
   paper presents a theoretical model of CRI to study this threat in a
   systematic manner. While there is a common perception about the
   successful phishing attack involves creating an identical messages or
   website to deceive the internet user however this theory has not been
   utilized to evaluate this threat and investigate the gaps
   systematically. Our model attempts to evaluate this crime, review
   different research perspectives and approaches and investigate the gaps.
   In this sense, our literature review study is significant to generate
   attentiveness about phishing in order to boost thoughts and actions to
   improve the cyber security and gain internet users' confidence.},

Abstract = {Due to an increasing number of the internet user, services have recently
   been adjusted to be served on the websites; for example, money
   transference for banking affairs, trading and purchasing on the Internet
   and email, as well as social networks e.g. Hi5 and Face Book. At the
   mean time, the attacks launched toward the websites or web attack also
   have been found more often. In particular, SQL Injection Attack is
   considered the most harmful web attack and has been found and ranked on
   top of the frequently detected web-attack. Typically, the website
   developed by the web programmer with well-comprehension of SQL Injection
   will be prevented from this attacking. At the same time, over a half of
   the web programmers unfortunately has not studied well about this kind
   of web attack; therefore, a number of websites are still encountering
   the risk. Regarding the security, there were the uses of the IPS
   installation and firewall application with protecting functions against
   SQL Injection Attack as well as the Top 100 web-attack protections;
   however, the main problem is a very expensive cost of the
   protection-tool installation, in which medium and small organizations
   are unable to afford the installation cost.
   This research aimed to offer the solution for the protection system
   against SQL Injection Attack in which the web programmer needed not to
   waste the time in writing codes on the website. Besides, the system,
   designed by the researchers, cost a lower expense. The researchers
   proposed the protection system by using a computer and Linux as a
   blocker between the website and the user (placed on the server zone),
   and creating GUI Application that could define the rules in IPTABLES (a
   free firewall as the software equipped with Linux) in order to possibly
   protect against SQL Injection Attack. Moreover, the researchers' team
   assessed the performance of the protection system's security and
   functional speed, and found that the proposed protection could
   authentically protect the websites from SQL Injection Attack whereas the
   drop of the website's functional speed did not exceed 1\%.},

Abstract = {Phishing emails are rapidly increasing in sophistication, evolving from
   poorly crafted attempts to entice a recipient to click, into legitimate
   looking emails and attachments. In response, email providers have to
   improve their detection technology by adding new rules to their
   firewalls and filters to block incoming spam and phishing emails. To
   overcome technical measures, attackers modify the content of their
   phishing emails and the source email address. In this cat and mouse
   game, network defenders rely on the user to report new threats, and the
   users depend on phishing awareness training to help them identify
   malicious emails. Fora large organization like the United States DoD
   (DoD) which boasts a workforce of 3.2 million employees, it is difficult
   to properly train employees to identify and report malicious emails.
   Like other organizations the DoD requires its employees to complete
   phishing awareness training, however the effectiveness of this training
   is widely disputed. Phishing prevention can be broken into three main
   components: automated filters and firewalls, automated warning messages,
   and behavioral training. This paper analyzes existing United States DoD
   phishing awareness behavioral training and proposes 3 principles of an
   improved behavioral training model. This paper will detail how focused
   training objectives, a DoD content-sharing platform and a realistic
   delivery method can be combined to offer an effective and sustainable
   phishing awareness campaign.},

Abstract = {We consider a system consisting of multiple interdependent assets, and a
   set of defenders, each responsible for securing a subset of the assets
   against an attacker. The interdependencies between assets are captured
   by an attack graph, where an edge from one asset to another indicates
   that if the former asset is compromised, an attack can be launched on
   the latter asset. Each edge has an associated probability of successful
   attack, which can be reduced via security investments by the defender
   responsible for that edge. While prior work has studied the security
   investments in such scenarios, in this work we consider what happens
   when the defenders exhibit characteristics of boundedly-rational human
   decision-making that have been identified by behavioral economics. In
   particular, humans have been shown to perceive probabilities in a
   nonlinear manner, typically overweighting low probabilities and
   underweighting high probabilities. We show that such nonlinear
   probability weighting can affect the security investments in
   interdependent systems, and suboptimal investments can arise under such
   weighting in certain network topologies. We also show that the presence
   of a defender who exhibits behavioral probability weighting can be
   beneficial for the other defenders in the network, in terms of making
   their assets more secure.},

Abstract = {Electronic mail (Email) or the paperless mail is becoming the most
   acceptable, faster and cheapest way of formal and informal information
   sharing between users. Around 500 billion mails are sent each day and
   the count is expected to be increasing. Today, even the sensitive and
   private information are shared through emails, thus making it the
   primary target for attackers and hackers. Also, the companies having
   their own mail server, relies on cloud system for storing the mails at a
   lower cost and maintenance. This affected the privacy of users as the
   searching pattern is visible to the cloud. To rectify this, we need to
   have a secure architecture for storing the emails and retrieve them
   according to the user queries. Data as well as the queries and
   computations to retrieve the relevant mails should be hidden from the
   third party. This article proposes a modified homomorphic encryption
   (MHE) technique to secure the mails. Homomorphic encryption is made
   practical using MHE and by incorporating Map Reduce parallel programming
   model, the execution time is exponentially reduced. Well known
   techniques in information retrieval, like Vector Space model and Term
   Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) concepts are utilized
   for finding relevant mails to the query. The analysis done on the
   dataset proves that our method is efficient in terms of execution time
   and in ensuring the security of the data and the privacy of the users.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a SIM-based tool for user authentication in various
   service areas such as financial transactions in e-commerce. Other remote
   services can use SIM as an authentication tool over existing GSM
   technology through GPRS, which is an additional packet data feature for
   the GSM network. GPRS enables packet-switched traffic to exist in
   predominantly circuit-switched GSM infrastructure. As GPRS is designed
   to support packet based protocols, such as the Internet Protocol (IP)
   based burst and uneven traffic flow, it enables new services such as
   reasonably fast access to the Internet, electronic mail and other data
   oriented services. These services have been too inefficient in
   traditional circuit-switched digital mobile networks. Using GPRS
   features the e-commerce applications can use SIM for user authentication
   in transactions. SIM can also be a tool for user identity and
   authentication around the corporate intranets. This can reduce security
   infrastructure setup and investment overhead for the security concerned
   organizations. This paper presents an electronic payment protocol that
   uses SIM based authentication along with illustration of its formal
   modelling and verification results. The proposed authentication system
   offers more robust security features than other electronic transaction
   systems proposed to date.},

Abstract = {Email and chat still constitute the majority of electronic communication
   on the Internet. The standardisation and acceptance of protocols such as
   SMTP, IMAP, POP3, XMPP, and IRC has allowed to deploy servers for email
   and chat in a decentralised and interoperable fashion. These protocols
   can be secured by providing encryption with TLS-directly or via the
   STARTTLS extension. X.509 PKIs and ad hoc methods can be leveraged to
   authenticate communication peers. However, secure configuration is not
   straight-forward and many combinations of encryption and authentication
   mechanisms lead to insecure deployments and potentially compromise of
   data in transit. In this paper, we present the largest study to date
   that investigates the security of our email and chat infrastructures. We
   used active Internet-wide scans to determine the amount of secure
   service deployments, and employed passive monitoring to investigate to
   which degree user agents actually choose secure mechanisms for their
   communication. We addressed both client-to-server interactions as well
   as server-to-server forwarding. Apart from the authentication and
   encryption mechanisms that the investigated protocols offer on the
   transport layer, we also investigated the methods for client
   authentication in use on the application layer. Our findings shed light
   on an insofar unexplored area of the Internet. Our results, in a
   nutshell, are a mix of both positive and negative findings. While large
   providers offer good security for their users, most of our communication
   is poorly secured in transit, with weaknesses in the cryptographic setup
   and especially in the choice of authentication mechanisms. We present a
   list of actionable changes to improve the situation.},

Abstract = {We explore the use of a new way to log into a web service, such as email
   or social media. Using on-demand biometrics, users sign in from a
   browser on a computer using just their name, which sends a request to
   their phone for approval. Users approve this request by authenticating
   on their phone using their fingerprint, which completes the login in the
   browser. On-demand biometrics thus replace passwords or temporary access
   codes found in two-step verification with the ease of use of biometrics.
   We present the results of an interview study on the use of on-demand
   biometrics with a live login backend. Participants perceived our system
   as convenient and fast to use and also expressed their trust in
   fingerprint authentication to keep their accounts safe. We motivate the
   design of on-demand biometrics, present an analysis of participants' use
   and responses around general account security and authentication, and
   conclude with implications for designing fast and easy cross-device

Abstract = {User authentication is essential for accessing computing resources,
   network resources, email accounts, online portals etc. To authenticate a
   user, system stores user credentials (user id and password pair) in
   system. It has been an interested field problem to discover user
   password from a system and similarly protecting them against any such
   possible attack. In this work we show that passwords are still
   vulnerable to hash chain based and efficient dictionary attacks. Human
   generated passwords use some identifiable patterns. We have analysed a
   sample of 19 million passwords, of different lengths, available online
   and studied the distribution of the symbols in the password strings. We
   show that the distribution of symbols in user passwords is affected by
   the native language of the user. From symbol distributions we can build
   smart and efficient dictionaries, which are smaller in size and their
   coverage of plausible passwords from Key-space is large. These smart
   dictionaries make dictionary based attacks practical.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Healthcare systems often expose patients to significant,
   preventable harm causing an estimated 44,000 to 98,000 deaths or more
   annually. This has propelled patient safety to the forefront, with
   reporting systems allowing for the review of local events to determine
   their root causes. As residents engage in a substantial amount of
   patient care in academic emergency departments, it is critical to use
   these safety event reports for resident-focused interventions and
   educational initiatives. This study analyzes reports from the Virginia
   Commonwealth University Health System to understand how the reports are
   categorized and how it relates to opportunities for resident education.
   Methods: Identifying categories from the literature, three subject
   matter experts (attending physician, nursing director, registered nurse)
   categorized an initial 20 reports to resolve category gaps and then 100
   reports to determine inter-rater reliability. Given sufficient
   agreement, the remaining 400 reports were coded individually for type of
   event and education among other categories.
   Results: After reviewing 513 events, we found that the most common event
   types were issues related to staff and resident training (25\%) and
   communication (18\%), with 31\% requiring no education, 46\% requiring
   directed educational feedback to an individual or group, 20\% requiring
   education through monthly safety updates or meetings, 3\% requiring
   urgent communication by email or in-person, and <1\% requiring
   simulation.
   Conclusion: Twenty years after the publication of To Err is Human, gains
   have been made integrating quality assurance and patient safety within
   medical education and hospital systems, but there remains extensive work
   to be done. Through a review and analysis of our patient safety event
   reporting system, we were able to gain a better understanding of the
   events that are submitted, including the types of events and their
   severity, and how these relate to the types of educational interventions
   provided (eg, feedback, simulation). We also determined that these
   events can help inform resident education and learning using various
   types of education. Additionally, incorporating residents in the review
   process, such as through root cause analyses, can provide residents with
   high-quality, engaging learning opportunities and useful, lifelong
   skills, which is invaluable to our learners and future physicians.},

Abstract = {Phishing in an enterprise is serious issue rising in wide scale and
   complexity, as phishers use email phishing via obfuscated, malicious or
   phished URLs and continuously adapt or innovate their strategies to lure
   victims for identity theft for financial benefits. To gain victim's
   trust and confidence phishers have started using visceral factors and
   familiarity cues. Phishing is not always money centric; phisher defame
   the user's goodwill and character. Defamation in enterprise could be
   much more traumatic than being embarrassed at a social networking site.
   It is a challenging task to address this issue. It is evident through
   literature review that single phishing detection filter approaches are
   insufficient to detect phishing in enterprise environ. Therefore, a
   novel anti-phishing model for enterprise using artificial neural network
   is proposed. In addition, this model effectively identifies whether the
   phishing email is known phishing or unknown phishing to reduce the trust
   and familiarity-based email phishing enterprise environ. The
   feed-forward backpropagation and Levenberg-Marquart methods of ANN are
   adopted to enhance the URL classification process and with Fuzzy
   Inference System to get result with imprecise data of social features.
   The proposed model can accurately classify the known and unknown email
   phishing via URLs.},

Abstract = {Recruitment of study participants is a challenging process for health
   professionals and patients. The Translational Medicine and Patient
   Safety in Europe (TRANSFoRm) clinical trial tools enable automated
   identification, recruitment and follow-up in clinical trials,
   potentially saving time, effort and costs for all parties involved.
   This study evaluates the acceptability and feasibility of TRANSFoRm to
   improve clinical trial recruitment in primary care.
   A feasibility study was conducted in three general practices in Poland.
   Participants were physicians and patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux
   disease. Semi-structured interviews were held to obtain feedback about
   the usefulness, ease of use and overall experience with the TRANSFoRm
   tools and to identify potential usability issues. Data were analysed
   thematically.
   A total of 5 physicians and 10 patients participated in the study.
   Physicians were satisfied with the usefulness of the system, as it
   enabled easier and faster identification, recruitment and follow-up of
   patients compared with existing methods. Patients found the TRANSFoRm
   apps easy to use to report patient outcomes. However, they also felt
   that the apps may not be useful for patients with limited exposure to
   smartphone and web technologies. Two main usability issues were
   identified: physicians could not access the result of the randomization
   at the end of each visit, and participants could not locate the
   follow-up reminder email.
   This study provides new evidence on the acceptability and feasibility of
   TRANSFoRm to enable automated identification, recruitment and follow-up
   of study participants in primary care trials. It also helps to better
   understand and address users' requirements in eHealth-supported clinical
   research.},

Abstract = {The penetration of cellular networks worldwide and emergence of smart
   phones has led to a revolution in mobile content. Users consume diverse
   content when, for example, exchanging photos, playing games, browsing
   websites, and viewing multimedia. Current phone platforms provide
   protections for user privacy, the cellular radio, and the integrity of
   the OS itself. However, few offer protections to protect the content
   once it enters the phone. For example, MP3-based MMS or photo content
   placed on Android smart phones can be extracted and shared with
   impunity. In this paper, we explore the requirements and enforcement of
   digital rights management (DRM) policy on smart phones. An analysis of
   the Android market shows that DRM services should ensure: a) protected
   content is accessible only by authorized phones b) content is only
   accessible by provider-endorsed applications, and c) access is regulated
   by contextual constraints, e. g., used for a limited time, a maximum
   number of view-ings, etc. The Porscha system developed in this work
   places content proxies and reference monitors within the Android
   middleware to enforce DRM policies embedded in received content. A pilot
   study controlling content obtained over SMS, MMS, and email illustrates
   the expressibility and enforcement of Porscha policies. Our experiments
   demonstrate that Porscha is expressive enough to articulate needed DRM
   policies and that their enforcement has limited impact on performance.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a SIM-based tool for user authentication in various
   service areas such as financial transactions in e-commerce. Other remote
   services can use SIM as an authentication tool over existing GSM
   technology through GPRS, which is an additional packet data feature for
   the GSM network. It allows both packet-switched and circuit-switched
   traffic to exist in the GSM infrastructure. As GPRS is designed to
   support packet based protocols, such as the Internet Protocol (IP) based
   bursty and uneven traffic flow, it enables new services such as
   reasonably fast access to the Internet, electronic mail and other data
   oriented services, that have been too inefficient in traditional
   circuit-switched digital mobile networks. Using GPRS features, the
   e-commerce applications can use SIM as user anthentication for
   transactions. SIM can also be a tool for user identity and
   authentication around the corporate intranets. This can reduce security
   infrastructure setup and investment overhead for the security concerned
   organizations. This paper depicts an electronic payment protocol by
   means of SIM based authentication with the illustrations of itsformal
   modelling \& verification results.},

Title = {User-centred clinical decision support to implement emergency

   the pragmatic group randomised EMBED trial},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Introduction The goal of this trial is to determine whether
   implementation of a user-centred clinical decision support (CDS) system
   can increase adoption of initiation of buprenorphine (BUP) into the
   routine emergency care of individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD).
   Methods A pragmatic cluster randomised trial is planned to be carried
   out in 20 emergency departments (EDs) across five healthcare systems
   over 18 months. The intervention consists of a user-centred CDS
   integrated into ED clinician electronic workflow and available for
   guidance to: (1) determine whether patients presenting to the ED meet
   criteria for OUD, (2) assess withdrawal symptoms and (3) ascertain and
   motivate patient willingness to initiate treatment. The CDS guides the
   ED clinician to initiate BUP and facilitate follow-up. The primary
   outcome is the rate of BUP initiated in the ED. Secondary outcomes are:
   (1) rates of receiving a referral, (2) fidelity with the CDS and (3)
   rates of clinicians providing any ED-initiated BUP, referral for ongoing
   treatment and receiving Drug Addiction Act of 2000 training. Primary and
   secondary outcomes will be analysed using generalised linear mixed
   models, with fixed effects for intervention status (CDS vs usual care),
   prespecified site and patient characteristics, and random effects for
   study site.
   Ethics and dissemination The protocol has been approved by the Western
   Institutional Review Board. No identifiable private information will be
   collected from patients. A waiver of informed consent was obtained for
   the collection of data for clinician prescribing and other activities.
   As a minimal risk implementation study of established best practices, an
   Independent Study Monitor will be utilised in place of a Data Safety
   Monitoring Board. Results will be reported in ClinicalTrials.gov and
   published in open-access, peer-reviewed journals, presented at national
   meetings and shared with the clinicians at participating sites via a
   broadcast email notification of publications.},

Title = {ML-SPAs: Fortifying Healthcare Cybersecurity Leveraging Varied Machine
   Learning Approaches against Spear Phishing Attacks},
Journal = {CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS \& CONTINUA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {81},
Number = {3},
Pages = {4049-4080},
Abstract = {Spear Phishing Attacks (SPAs) pose a significant threat to the
   healthcare sector, resulting in data breaches, financial losses, and
   compromised patient confidentiality. Traditional defenses, such as
   firewalls and antivirus software, often fail to counter these
   sophisticated attacks, which target human vulnerabilities. To strengthen
   defenses, healthcare organizations are increasingly adopting Machine
   Learning (ML) techniques. ML-based SPA defenses use advanced algorithms
   to analyze various features, including email content, sender behavior,
   and attachments, to detect potential threats. This capability enables
   proactive security measures that address risks in real-time. The
   interpretability of ML models fosters trust and allows security teams to
   continuously refine these algorithms as new attack methods emerge.
   Implementing ML techniques requires integrating diverse data sources,
   such as electronic health records, email logs, and incident reports,
   which enhance the algorithms' learning environment. Feedback from
   end-users further improves model performance. Among tested models, the
   hierarchical models, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) achieved the
   highest accuracy at 99.99\%, followed closely by the sequential
   Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model at 99.94\%. In
   contrast, the traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model showed an
   accuracy of 98.46\%. This difference underscores the superior
   performance of advanced sequential and hierarchical models in detecting
   SPAs compared to traditional approaches.},

   proposed. It is designed to simplify the authentication process without

Title = {Perceived ability to comply with national COVID-19 mitigation strategies
   and their impact on household finances, food security, and mental
   well-being of medical and pharmacy students in Liberia},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {16},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 9},
Abstract = {Introduction From the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, guidance from WHO
   has promoted social distancing, wearing face masks, frequent hand
   washing, and staying-at-home as measures to prevent the spread of
   COVID-19. For many across Africa, compliance can be difficult. The aim
   of this study was to 1) understand the impact of student's household's
   ability to comply with COVID-19 mitigation strategies, 2) identify
   predictors of mitigation strategy compliance, and 3) describe the impact
   of COVID-19 on household economics, food-security, and mental
   well-being. Materials and methods We conducted an email-based survey
   among current medical and pharmacy students of the University of Liberia
   College of Health Sciences between July and October 2020. The
   questionnaire was designed to explore their household's ability to
   comply with current mitigation strategies, as well as the pandemic ` s
   impact on the student's household's finances and food security.
   Descriptive statistics were used to delineate demographic
   characteristics. Logistic regression was used to model factors
   associated with ability to comply with COVID-19 mitigation strategies,
   as well as participant's food security. Results 113 persons responded to
   the questionnaire. Seventy-six (67 center dot 3\%) reported income
   losses as a result of the pandemic, with 93 (82 center dot 3\%)
   reporting being ``somewhat{''} or ``very worried{''} about their
   households' finances. Seventy-seven (68 center dot 1\%) participants
   reported food stocks that were sufficient for one-week or less. Forty
   (35\%) participants reported eating less preferred foods or skipping
   meals in the past week. Overall, 20 participants (19 center dot 4\%) had
   a positive depression screen. Conclusions Study participants showed
   mixed results in being able to adhere to national COVID-19 mitigation
   strategies, with household level stressors experienced around finances
   and food security. Until Liberia has access to vaccinations for most of
   its citizens, COVID-19 response measures need to provide social
   protections that address basic needs (shelter, clothing and food), and
   which specifically targets food insecurity. Preventative interventions
   for mental health problems must be incorporated into Liberia's response
   to the pandemic.},

Title = {PODAR: A Collision Risk Model Offering Valid Signals for Vehicular
   Interactions},
Journal = {IEEE INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS MAGAZINE},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 MAR 7},
Abstract = {Acquiring valid signals for collision risk during driving is essential
   for the design of safety assistance or self-driving systems. Currently,
   there is a gap in accessible models that offer rational alerts for
   diverse driving scenarios. This article introduces a generalized, yet
   concise framework called the potential damage risk (PODAR) model for
   estimating collision risk and issuing warnings of hazard cases. The
   PODAR model is devised by connecting collision risk with potential
   collision damage across both spatial and temporal dimensions in a
   meaningful physical way, which includes four key components: trajectory
   prediction, damage estimation, spatiotemporal attenuation, and attention
   simulation. An empirical model featuring six adjustable parameters is
   presented and calibrated using a publicly available dataset for
   validation. With predefined fixed risk thresholds, the PODAR model
   demonstrates the ability to issue valid warnings for potential
   collisions in both longitudinal and lateral directions, negating the
   need for manual driving situation classification. The study investigates
   the performance of the PODAR model in a range of dynamic driving
   situations through numerical simulations, such as side-pass,
   car-following, and an unsignaled left turn. Additionally, three
   demonstrative cases derived from the InD dataset, which features
   realistic driving scenarios, are also presented. The results reveal that
   the PODAR model is effective in estimating risk and detecting
   collisions, providing reliable signals for potential collisions. In
   addition, the PODAR model, as a generalized framework, has the ability
   to incorporate existing metrics and exhibits impressive scalability to
   integrate new advancements in trajectory prediction and human-like risk
   perception, thanks to its modular structure.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a general handheld stick haptic redirection method
   that allows the user to experience complex shapes with haptic feedback
   through both tapping and extended contact, such as in contour tracing.
   As the user extends the stick to make contact with a virtual object, the
   contact point with the virtual object and the targeted contact point
   with the physical object are continually updated, and the virtual stick
   is redirected to synchronize the virtual and real contacts. Redirection
   is applied either just to the virtual stick, or to both the virtual
   stick and hand. A user study (N = 26) confirms the effectiveness of the
   proposed redirection method. A first experiment following a two-interval
   forced-choice design reveals that the offset detection thresholds are
   {[}-15cm, +15cm]. A second experiment asks participants to guess the
   shape of an invisible virtual object by tapping it and by tracing its
   contour with the handheld stick, using a real world disk as a source of
   passive haptic feedback. The experiment reveals that using our haptic
   redirection method participants can identify the invisible object with
   78\% accuracy.},

   2013The rapid growth and expanding use of high school strength and
   conditioning facilities (SCFs) creates a need to research and better
   understand these vital facilities. This study was designed to examine
   SCFs at the high school level including facility size, equipment,
   leadership/staffing, and safety. A 70-item online survey instrument,
   developed with expert input from certified strength professionals, was
   used to collect data regarding the SCFs in high schools throughout a
   midwestern state, and was distributed via email to a total of 390 high
   school athletic directors. Survey respondents (n = 108) all reported the
   presence of SCFs with 95.4\% indicating a dedicated SCF space. A strong
   positive correlation (r = 0.610, p 0.001) was determined between the
   variables of SCF size in square feet and school size measured by total
   enrollment. Analysis of variance and (2) analyses revealed significant
   differences in equipment, facility size, and safety factors based on the
   categorical variables of school size and the presence of certified
   strength and conditioning specialist (CSCS) leadership. It appears the
   CSCS's application of their scientific knowledge goes beyond training
   athletes for the goal of improving athletic performance to actually
   influence the SCF itself. Athletic administrators at the high school
   level need to recognize the impact CSCS program leadership can have on
   the overall quality of the strength and conditioning program and
   facility.},

Title = {What is the impact on recruitment of a shortened compared with a
   standard-length participant information leaflet? PROMETHEUS in

   controlled trial},
Journal = {TRIALS},
Year = {2025},

Abstract = {BackgroundParticipant Information Leaflets (PILs) are lengthy and
   increasingly complex, and could deter research participation. A
   shortened PIL may be more appealing as it is likely to provide a more a
   manageable volume of information. Previous research has found that
   shortened PILs are no less effective for recruitment outcomes, and we
   deemed it useful to replicate this in an online setting. We also decided
   to compare retention rates, given the potential for more information to
   increase participants' motivation.AimTo evaluate the efficacy of a
   shortened vs standard-length PIL on trial recruitment and retention
   rates.MethodsThis two-arm study within a trial (SWAT) was embedded in a
   host randomised controlled trial (RCT)-IBD-BOOST.Potential participants
   were randomised to receive a standard-length or shortened PIL
   electronically for recruitment to the host RCT. An ethics committee
   approved potential participants being blinded to this
   randomisation.Primary outcome: The percentage of SWAT participants
   receiving the shortened vs standard PIL who were recruited to the
   RCT.MethodsThis two-arm study within a trial (SWAT) was embedded in a

   were randomised to receive a standard-length or shortened PIL
   electronically for recruitment to the host RCT. An ethics committee

   randomisation.Primary outcome: The percentage of SWAT participants

   RCT.MethodsThis two-arm study within a trial (SWAT) was embedded in a
   host randomised controlled trial (RCT)-IBD-BOOST.Potential participants
   were randomised to receive a standard-length or shortened PIL
   electronically for recruitment to the host RCT. An ethics committee
   approved potential participants being blinded to this
   randomisation.Primary outcome: The percentage of SWAT participants
   receiving the shortened vs standard PIL who were recruited to the
   RCT.ResultsFour thousand two hundred one participants were randomised to
   the standard-length (n = 2099) and shortened (n = 2102) PIL arms.
   Thirty-four email queries were received about the PILs-18 from those who
   received the standard and 16 from those receiving the shortened. Seven
   hundred eight SWAT participants were recruited to the RCT-333 (15.86\%)
   who received the standard-length PIL and 375 (17.84\%) who received the
   shortened (OR = 1.15, (95\%CI = 0.98, 1.35), p = 0.09). Retention rates
   in the RCT were not statistically different between groups.ConclusionWe
   did not find evidence of a significant difference between RCT
   recruitment and retention rates in participants randomised to the
   standard-length PIL compared with the shortened. It may be that a
   shortened PIL has the same effect on recruitment and retention outcomes,
   providing that the trial does not require extensive information for
   other reasons (e.g. safety). Therefore, it could be argued that
   researchers have a choice about how long to make PILs, perhaps with a
   link to more detail. Alternatively, given that there was no benefit of
   the shortened PIL, it may be worth comparing written PILs with other
   methods of conveying information to determine optimal means of
   encouraging participation and retention in decentralised trials.Host

Abstract = {Information technology services have undergone a revolution in the last
   decade, as the demand for services like cloud storage, mobile
   applications, portable electronics and high speed data are exponentially
   increasing. As we move towards a data-centric environment, it is of
   paramount importance that the security provided should intercept and
   block all possible threats. These security threats are continually
   evolving to circumvent the immediate countermeasures implemented. In
   addition to the existing type of malicious computer programs like virus,
   Trojans, and worms, a new malware called as ransomware is spawning
   across the computing world for gaining monetary compensation. Presently,
   numerous types of ransomware are infecting personal and commercial
   internet users globally. The ransomware is a type of malware that enters
   into a host machine via a malicious email, link or executable program.
   This malware encrypts critical user data, and the only way to recover
   the data is by paying a ransom using a cryptocurrency. This paper will
   focus on learning the intricate working of crypto locker ransomware
   using asymmetric encryption and Software Defined Networking. The time
   taken for encryption of files will be observed for different data sizes
   and methods will be proposed to mitigate the threat.},

Abstract = {In traditional PKC, public keys of the users are essentially random
   string generated from random secret keys, thus, public key certificates
   are required to link the relations between user's identities and their
   public keys. In ID-based cryptography, public keys are identities such
   as names, email address, and so on. It avoids the use of certificates
   which is a burden in traditional PKC. However, it exist key escrow
   problem. In a certificateless cryptographic system, it avoids the
   inherent key escrow in the ID-based crypto-system, and heavy certificate
   maintenance in the PKC system. For all we know, most of the existing
   certificateless signature schemes cannot realize the revocation of a
   signature. To overcome this issue, we put forward a novel revocable
   certificateless signature scheme under the standard security model in
   this paper. It can provide the revocation of a signature by publishing a
   value in the revocation list. And the scheme can be provably secure
   based on the standard computational Diffie-Hellman assumption.},

Abstract = {For many users, a private key based wallet serves as the primary entry
   point to blockchains. Commonly recommended wallet authentication
   methods, such as mnemonics or hardware wallets, can be cumbersome. This
   difficulty in user onboarding has significantly hindered the adoption of
   blockchain-based applications.
   We develop zkLogin, a novel technique that leverages identity tokens
   issued by popular platforms (any OpenID Connect enabled platform e.g.,
   Google, Facebook, etc.) to authenticate transactions. At the heart of
   zkLogin lies a signature scheme allowing the signer to sign using their
   existing OpenID accounts and nothing else. This improves the user
   experience significantly as users do not need to remember a new secret
   and can reuse their existing accounts.
   zkLogin provides strong security and privacy guarantees. Unlike prior
   works, zkLogin's security relies solely on the underlying platform's
   authentication mechanism without the need for any additional trusted
   parties (e.g., trusted hardware or oracles). As the name suggests,
   zkLogin leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to ensure that the
   sensitive link between a user's off-chain and on-chain identities is
   hidden, even from the platform itself.
   zkLogin enables a number of important applications outside blockchains.
   It allows billions of users to produce verifiable digital content
   leveraging their existing digital identities, e.g., email address. For
   example, a journalist can use zkLogin to sign a news article with their
   email address, allowing verification of the article's authorship by any
   party.
   We have implemented and deployed zkLogin on the Sui blockchain as an
   additional alternative to traditional digital signature-based addresses.
   Due to the ease of web3 on-boarding just with social login, many
   hundreds of thousands of zkLogin accounts have already been generated in
   various industries such as gaming, DeFi, direct payments, NFT
   collections, sports racing, cultural heritage, and many more.},

Abstract = {Network exists widely in nature and human society. The spread of
   infections such as computer viruses, diseases and rumors poses great
   challenges to economic and social system. It is an important issue in
   the network propagation control to protect individuals by finding
   effective intervention strategies. By analyzing network propagation
   processes, we build the probabilistic network propagation model and
   express the intervention goals as probabilistic logical properties.
   Furthermore, we propose to use probabilistic model checking method to
   solve intervention problem. In addition, we take the discrete spreading
   model of the email virus as an example and make a further study on three
   kinds of specific protective measures including the free propagation,
   the installation protection and the periodical protection. We conduct
   experiments with the probabilistic model checker PRISM and apply
   approximate probabilistic model checking method to solve large-scale
   problem. The results demonstrate the efficiency and feasibility of our
   proposed method.},

   Outage Performances},

Abstract = {In this contribution, a thorough investigation of the performance of
   rate splitting is conducted in terms of outage and secrecy outage for
   the simultaneous service to a near user and far user, where the latter
   attempts to overhear the message of the former. The source transmits a
   linear combination of the users' common stream and private streams. Once
   the common stream is retrieved, two decoding strategies can be adopted
   by each user. In the first strategy, the nodes (near or far) treat the
   far user's private stream as noise to retrieve the private stream of the
   near user, then the far user decodes its own stream. In the second
   strategy, the nodes decode the far user's private stream by treating the
   one of the near user as noise, then the near user retrieves its private
   stream while the far user decodes the stream of the near user in its
   attempt to overhear it. Considering the four decoding combinations, we
   obtain exact closed-form expressions for the outage probability, and
   provide tight approximations for the secrecy outage probability.
   Comparative results are also provided. In particular, it is shown that
   to achieve better outage probability, with no concern about secrecy,
   once the decoding of the common stream is completed, each user should
   first retrieve the private stream with lower target data rate by
   treating the other private stream as noise. To improve the secrecy
   outage probability, once the common stream is decoded, the near user
   must first decode the far user's private stream, and the far user should
   first retrieve the private stream with lower target data rate.},

Abstract = {Preventing workplace phishing depends on the actions of every employee,
   regardless of cybersecurity expertise. Based on 24 semi-structured
   interviews with mid-career office workers (70.8\% women, averaging 44
   years old) at two U.S. universities, we found that less than 21\% of our
   participants had any formal anti-phishing training. Much of what our
   participants know about phishing comes from informal sources that
   emphasize ``tips{''} and ``tricks{''} like those found in conversations
   with friends, news stories, newsletters, social media, and podcasts.
   These informal channels provide opportunities for IT professionals
   wishing to enhance employees' anti-phishing awareness by better aligning
   the delivery of expert advice with employees' current practices and
   desires. We provide four recommendations designed to embrace ``guerrilla
   learning{''} by distributing anti-phishing educational resources across
   the workplace and workday in part to encourage the delivery of more
   accurate information in more informal and incidental ways, and greater
   dialogue between anti-phishing training instructors and learners.},

Abstract = {Phishing, a prevalent cybercrime tactic for decades, remains a
   significant threat in today's digital world. By leveraging clever social
   engineering elements and modern technology, cybercrime targets many
   individuals, businesses, and organizations to exploit trust and
   security. These cyberattackers are often disguised in many trustworthy
   forms to appear as legitimate sources. By cleverly using psychological
   elements like urgency, fear, social proof, and other manipulative
   strategies, phishers can lure individuals into revealing sensitive and
   personalized information. Building on this pervasive issue within modern
   technology, this paper will aim to analyze the effectiveness of 15 Large
   Language Models (LLMs) in detecting phishing attempts, specifically
   focusing on a randomized set of ``419 Scam{''} emails. The objective is
   to determine which LLMs can accurately detect phishing emails by
   analyzing a text file containing email metadata based on predefined
   criteria. The experiment concluded that the following models, ChatGPT
   3.5, GPT-3.5-Turbo-Instruct, and ChatGPT, were the most effective in
   detecting phishing emails.},

Abstract = {Voice assistants support contactless smart device control and thus act
   as a holy grail of human-computer interaction. However, recent studies
   reveal that an adversary can manipulate devices by vicious voice
   commands. This security risk is caused by only executing one-time
   liveness detection and lacking safeguard modules after service
   activation. Therefore, identifying speaker type (i.e., human
   articulators or loudspeakers) is critical in protecting voice-driven
   services during an entire interaction session. In this article, we
   propose a continuous voice liveness detection approach LiveProbe,
   leveraging unique energy response patterns in frequency bands induced by
   distinct voice generation mechanisms. The rationality behind LiveProbe
   is presented in two aspects: human articulator reshapes initial voices
   by exquisitely coordinated movements of vocal organs, which act as
   band-pass filters generating unique energy responses; nevertheless, the
   internal modules of loudspeakers are position fixed and cannot reproduce
   this response characteristic. To that end, we first work on voice
   generation mechanisms behind two-type speakers that cause spectrum
   differences. Then, we elaborately construct signal processing and
   deep-learning modules to extract liveness features. Especially, our
   approach does not interfere with normal voice interaction and need not
   to carry customized sensors. The experiment presents its effectiveness
   against potential attacks with a false acceptance rate of 0.51\%.},

Title = {The Medium Is the Message: How Do Canadian University Students Want
   Digital Medication Information?},
Journal = {LIFE-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {(1) Background: To facilitate optimal prescription medication benefits
   and safety, it is important that people are informed about their
   prescription medications. As we shift towards using the digital medium
   to communicate medication information, it is important to address the
   needs and preferences of different user groups so that they are more
   likely to read and use this information. In this study, we examined what
   digital medication information (DMI) format Canadian University students
   want and why. (2) Methods: This study was a qualitative investigation of
   young (aged 18-35) Canadian University students' (N = 36) preferences
   and rationale supporting these preferences with respect to three
   potential formats for providing DMI: email, a mobile application (app),
   and online. Reported advantages and disadvantages of each of the three
   DMI formats were identified and categorized into unique themes. (3)
   Results: Findings from this study suggest that Canadian University
   Students most want to receive DMI by email, followed by a mobile app,
   and finally they were least receptive to online DMI. Participants
   provided diverse themes of reasons supporting their preferences. (4)
   Conclusions: Different user groups may have different needs with respect
   to receiving DMI. The themes from this study suggest that using a
   formative evaluation framework for assessing different DMI formats may
   be useful in future research. Email may be the best way to share DMI
   with younger, generally healthy, Canadian University students who are on
   few medications. Further research is required to explore whether other
   mediums for DMI are more appropriate for users with other
   characteristics (e.g., older and less educated) and contexts (e.g.,
   polypharmacy and complex conditions). Given the flexibility of digital
   information, DMI could plausibly be provided in multiple formats and
   could allow users to choose the option they like best and would be most
   likely to use.},

Journal = {BMC MEDICAL ETHICS},

Abstract = {Introduction: Information and communication technologies are becoming an
   integral part of medical practice, research and administration and their
   use will grow as telemedicine and electronic medical record use become
   part of routine practice. Security in maintaining patient data is
   important and there is a statuary obligation to do so, but few health
   professionals have been trained on how to achieve this. There is no
   information on the use of computers and email by doctors and nurses in
   South Africa in the workplace and at home, and whether their current
   computer practices meets legal and ethical requirements. The aims of
   this study were to determine the use of computers by healthcare
   practitioners in the workplace and home; the use and approach to data
   storage, encryption and security of patient data and patient email; and
   the use of informed consent to transmit data by email.
   Methods: A self-administered questionnaire was administered to 400
   health care providers from the state and private health care sectors.
   The questionnaire covered computer use in the workplace and at home,
   sharing of computers, data encryption and storage, email use, encryption
   of emails and storage, and the use of informed consent for email
   communication.
   Results: 193 doctors and 207 nurses in the private and public sectors
   completed the questionnaire. Forty (10\%) of participants do not use a
   computer. A third of health professionals were the only users of
   computers at work or at home. One hundred and ninety-eight respondents
   (55\%) did not know if the data on the computers were encrypted, 132
   (36.7\%) knew that the data were not encrypted and 30 (8.3\%)
   individuals knew that the data on the computers they were using were
   encrypted. Few doctors, 58 (16\%), received emails from patients, with
   doctors more likely to receive emails from patients than nurses (p =
   0.0025). Thirty-one percent of individuals did not respond to the
   emails. Emails were saved by 40 (69\%) recipients but only 5 (12.5\%)
   doctors encrypted the messages, 19 (47.5\%) individuals knowingly did
   not encrypt and 16 (40.0\%) did not know if they encrypted the data.
   While 20\% of health professionals have emailed patient data, but only
   41.7\% gained consent to do so.
   Conclusions: Most health professionals as sampled in South Africa are
   not compliant with the National Health Act or the Electronic
   Communications Transactions Act of South Africa or guidelines from
   regulatory bodies when managing patient data on computers. Many appear
   ignorant or lack the ability to comply with simple data security
   procedures.},

Abstract = {Social engineering is a methodology that allows an attacker to bypass
   technical controls by attacking the human element in an organization.
   There are many techniques commonly used in social engineering including
   but not limited to Trojan and phishing email messages, impersonation,
   persuasion, bribery, shoulder surfing, and dumpster diving. Hackers rely
   on social engineering attacks to bypass technical controls by focusing
   on the human factors. Social engineers often exploit the natural
   tendency people have toward trusting others who seem likeable or
   credible, deferring to authority or need to acquiesce to social
   conformity. Mitigation of social engineering begins with good policy and
   awareness training, but there are a number of other approaches an
   organization can take to defend against this type of an attack. Social
   engineering attacks are likely to increase, and it is becoming
   increasingly important for organizations to address this issue.},

Abstract = {As the easiest and cheapest way of authenticating an end user, password
   based authentication methods have been consistently chosen by almost
   every new cloud service. Unfortunately, the explosive growth of cloud
   services and web applications has made it impossible for users to manage
   dozens of passwords for accessing different cloud services. The
   situation is even worse considering the potential application of
   massively parallel computing devices such as GPU and ASIC for efficient
   password cracking. Hence, from a usability viewpoint, passwords may have
   reached the end of their useful life.
   Motivated by a number of recent industry initiatives for online
   authentication, we present Loxin, an innovative solution for
   password-less universal login. Loxin aims to improve on passwords with
   respect to both usability and security. Loxin takes advantages of push
   message services for mobile devices and enables users to access multiple
   cloud services by using pre-owned identities, such as email addresses,
   together with few taps on their mobile devices.
   In particular, the Loxin server cannot generate users' login
   credentials, thereby eliminating the potential risk of server
   compromises. Loxin is resistant to the most common attacks on cloud
   services such as replay attacks and man-in-the-middle attacks. We also
   discuss possible extensions for protecting Loxin from vendor lock-in and
   single point of failure, in order to ensure Loxin to be an open and
   stable authentication system. The application of the proposed Loxin
   security framework to the recent MintChip Challenge demonstrates the
   power of Loxin for building a real-world password-less mobile payment
   solution.},

Abstract = {This paper analyzes the findings of {[}1] regarding user privacy in
   Android apps. Mobile applications have come under scrutiny for
   allegations of data breaches and leaks, such as usernames, email IDs,
   and locations. Subsequent documented instances of these violations have
   led to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) imposing severe penalties on
   the app developers. Recently, apps such as TikTok and BabyBus were
   sanctioned and fined for flouting privacy regulations. To ensure the
   safety of young users, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
   (COPPA) was enacted to monitor the data usage of apps dedicated to
   children. Hence, it is imperative that children's apps adhere to COPPA.
   Towards this end, {[}1] proposes COPPA Tracking by Checking
   Hardware-level Activity (COPPTCHA), a Hardware Performance Counter-based
   (HPC) approach to validate COPPA-compliance of Android apps. The HPC
   data is used to train a Machine Learning classifier, which predicts
   COPPA violations with 99\% accuracy. This paper summarizes the benefits
   and pitfalls of using HPCs for detecting COPPA violations.},

Abstract = {Several websites integrate trackers without users' consent. Previous
   research studied whether notifying responsible website operators about
   such issues is an effective measure, often with limited success.
   Insights from marketing research suggest that personalizing notification
   emails may be an effective means to improve remediation rates, with
   previous research pointing in both directions. We studied this approach
   using a sample of 119 German fitness and sports blogs employing Google
   Analytics (GA) without user consent: In a first step, we compare the fix
   rate of blog operators that received a personalized notification
   tailored to their blog with the fix rate of operators that received a
   generic notification. We find that personalized notifications do neither
   increase remediation rate nor operators' response behavior. In a second
   step, we analyzed the reasons not to fix mentioned in (A) the email
   responses and (B) a survey sent to the blog operators. We find that they
   mostly center around (I) denial that a data leak exists, (II) a lack of
   resources to remedy the issue and (III) claims of specifically requiring
   GA. We hypothesize that an additional reason not to fix could be the
   so-called moral credentials phenomenon and sketch how to study that in
   future work.},

Abstract = {We explore the ecosystem of smartphone applications with respect to
   their privacy practices towards sensitive user data. In particular, we
   examine 96 free mobile applications across 10 categories, in both the
   Apple App Store and Google Play Store, to investigate how securely they
   transmit and handle user data. For each application, we perform wireless
   packet sniffing and a series of man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks to
   capture personal identifying information, such as usernames, passwords,
   etc. During the wireless packet sniffing, we monitor the traffic from
   the device when a specific application is in use to examine if any
   sensitive data is transmitted unencrypted. At the same time, we reveal
   and assess the list of ciphers that each application uses to establish a
   secure connection. During the MITM attacks, we use a variety of methods
   to try to decrypt the transmitted information.
   The results show that although all tested applications establish a
   secure TLS connection with the server, 85\% of them support weak
   ciphers. Additionally, 60\% of iOS and 25\% of Android applications
   transmit unencrypted user data over the Wi-Fi network. By performing a
   MITM attack we capture the username, password, and email in various
   apps, e.g. Instagram, Blackboard, Ebay, and Spotify. We manage to bypass
   certificate pinning in 75\% of the iOS applications, including Facebook.
   Finally, we observe that data is being forwarded to third party domains
   (mostly to domains that belong to Google and Apple).},

Abstract = {Instant messaging is an application that is widely used to communicate.
   Based on the wearesocial.com report, three of the five most used social
   media platforms are chat or instant messaging. Instant messaging was
   chosen for communication because it has security features in log in
   using a One Time Password (OTP) code, end-to-end encryption, and even
   two-factor authentication. However, instant messaging applications still
   have a vulnerability to account theft. This account theft occurs when
   the user loses his cellphone. Account theft can happen when a cellphone
   is locked or not. As a result of this account theft, thieves can read
   confidential messages and send fake news on behalf of the victim. In
   this research, instant messaging application security will be applied
   using hybrid encryption and two-factor authentication, which are made
   interrelated. Both methods will be implemented in 2 implementation
   designs. The implementation design is securing login and securing
   sending and receiving messages. For login security, QR Code
   implementation is sent via email. In sending and receiving messages, the
   message decryption process will be carried out when the user is
   authenticated using a fingerprint. Hybrid encryption as message security
   uses RSA 2048 and AES 128. Of the ten attempts to steal accounts that
   have been conducted, it is shown that the implementation design is
   proven to reduce the impact of account theft.},

Abstract = {Public key Encryption with Keyword Search (PEKS) aims in mitigating the
   impacts of data privacy versus utilization dilemma by allowing any user
   in the system to send encrypted files to the server to be searched by a
   receiver. The receiver can retrieve the encrypted files containing
   specific keywords by providing the corresponding trapdoors of these
   keywords to the server. Despite their merits, the existing PEKS schemes
   introduce a high end-to-end delay that may hinder their adoption in
   practice. Moreover, they do not scale well for large security parameters
   and provide no post-quantum security promises. In this paper, we propose
   two novel lattice-based PEKS schemes that offer a high computational
   efficiency along with better security assurances than that of the
   existing alternatives. Specifically, our NTRU-PEKS scheme achieves 18
   times lower end-to-end delay than the most efficient pairing-based
   alternatives. Our LWE-PEKS offers provable security in the standard
   model with a reduction to the worst-case lattice problems. We fully
   implemented our NTRU-PEKS scheme and benchmarked its performance as
   deployed on Amazon Web Services cloud infrastructures.},

Abstract = {Digital signatures guarantee practical security only if the
   corresponding verification keys are distributed authentically; however,
   arguably, satisfying solutions for the latter have not been found yet.
   This paper introduces a novel approach for cryptographic message
   authentication where this problem does not arise: A linkable message
   tagging scheme (LMT) identifies pairs of messages and accompanying
   authentication tags as related if and only if these tags were created
   using the same secret key. Importantly, our primitive fully avoids
   public keys and hence elegantly sidesteps the key distribution problem
   of signature schemes. As an application of LMT we envision an email
   authentication system with minimal user interaction. Email clients could
   routinely equip all outgoing messages with corresponding tags and verify
   for incoming messages whether they indeed originate from the same entity
   as previously or subsequently received messages with identical sender
   address. As technical contributions we formalize the notions of LMT and
   its (more efficient) variant CMT (classifiable message tagging),
   including corresponding notions of unforgeability. For both variants we
   propose a range of provably secure constructions, basing on different
   hardness assumptions, with and without requiring random oracles. This
   article extends prior work of the same authors that appeared in the
   proceedings of ACISP 2015 (Gunther and Poettering in 2015).},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {67},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Many mobile apps use encryption to protect user data. Therefore,
   research on the use of encrypted data in forensic investigations is
   warranted. When encrypting data, developers can incorporate data such as
   user information and passwords during the encryption key generation
   process. Currently, encryption keys can be protected by hardware
   security modules such as KeyStore and KeyChain using an OS-provided API.
   Hardware security modules use a built-in random number generator to
   create random keys and securely store them. As a result, it is
   practically impossible to decrypt data that have been encrypted using a
   hardware security module. However, cryptographic algorithm misuse,
   regardless of whether encryption keys are acquired, present an
   opportunity for data acquisition. In this paper, we show that a reused
   key attack that exploits a vulnerability caused by encryption scheme
   misuse can be used against a secure email service, ProtonMail, and
   Korea's representative instant messenger KakaoTalk.},

Abstract = {Every attempt to access to the Internet through a Web browser, email
   sent, VPN connection, VoIP call, instant message or other use of
   telecommunications systems involves cryptographic techniques. The most
   commonly applied technique is asymmetric cryptography, which is
   generally executed in the background without the user even being aware.
   It establishes a cryptographic code based on the computational
   complexity of mathematical problems. However, this type of cryptography,
   which is widely used in today's telecommunications systems, is under
   threat as electronics and computing rapidly develop. The development of
   fifth-generation cellular networks (5G) is gaining momentum, and given
   its wide field of application, security requires special attention. This
   is especially true faced with the development of quantum computers. One
   solution to this security challenge is to use more advanced techniques
   to establish cryptographic keys that are not susceptible to attack. An
   essential part of quantum cryptography, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)
   uses the principles of quantum physics to establish and distribute
   symmetric cryptographic keys between two geographically distant users.
   QKD establishes information-theoretically secure cryptographic keys that
   are resistant to eavesdropping when they are created. In this paper, we
   survey the security challenges and approaches in 5G networks concerning
   network protocols, interfaces and management organizations. We begin by
   examining the fundamentals of QKD and discuss the creation of QKD
   networks and their applications. We then outline QKD network
   architecture and its components and standards, following with a summary
   of QKD and post-quantum key distribution techniques and approaches for
   its integration into existing security frameworks such as VPNs (IPsec
   and MACsec). We also discuss the requirements, architecture and methods
   for implementing the FPGA-based encryptors needed to execute
   cryptographic algorithms with security keys. We discuss the performance
   and technologies of post-quantum cryptography, and finally, examine
   reported 5G demonstrations which have used quantum technologies,
   highlighting future research directions.},

Abstract = {The ``conversion rate{''} of spam - the probability that ail unsolicited
   e-mail will ultimately elicit it ``sale{''} - underlies the entire spam
   value proposition. However. our understanding of this critical behavior
   is quite limited, and the literature lacks any quantitative study
   concerning its true value. In this paper we present it methodology for
   measuring the conversion rate of spam. Using a, parasitic infiltration
   of an existing botnet's infrastructure, we analyze two spam campaigns:
   one designed to propagate a malware Trojan, the other marketing on-line
   pharmaceuticals. For nearly it half billion spam e-mails we identify the
   number that are successfully delivered, the number that pass through
   popular anti-spam filters, the number that elicit user visits to the
   advertised sites, and the number of ``sales{''} and ``infections{''}
   produced.},

Title = {HTTP header based phishing attack detection using machine learning},
Journal = {TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In the past, many techniques like blacklisting/whitelisting,
   third-party, search engine, visual similarity, heuristic, URL features,
   and website content were used for anti-phishing. Search engine-based,
   third-party assisted tools and blacklist/whitelist fail to identify new
   phishing attacks resulting in high FPR. Heuristic and visual similarity
   approaches are slow, whereas URL and web content-based techniques do not
   mimic the dynamic content of current websites and hence cannot stop
   zero-day attacks. A study was conducted to understand the critical
   features used in the past for anti-phishing, and we found 16 HTTP header
   features that were novel. In this paper, we have developed a real-time,
   highly scalable, feature-rich anti-phishing detection technique based on
   ML that extracts the HTTP headers (predominantly security headers) from
   web pages to identify them as legitimate or phished. It is observed that
   phishing sites are short-lived and are created to achieve a specific
   objective, like stealing the credential of a user. Once the goal is met,
   the sites are pulled down immediately. Hence these sites do not take
   pain to use the security features of web technology and only focus on
   making the site as similar as possible to the original website. Test
   results based on our novel features show high accuracy of 97.8\% with an
   average response time of 1.57 s. We have created multiple datasets for
   different scenarios, like a dataset for website creation through
   phishing tools and a new dataset for testing unseen phishing attacks.
   The results thus obtained show detection accuracy of 99\% and 95\%,
   respectively.

   header extraction module extracts novel email headers, and ML is used to

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Pages = {2856-2869},
Abstract = {The purpose of privacy-preserving spam filtering is to inspect email
   while preserving the privacy of its detection rules and the email
   content. Although many solutions have emerged, they suffer from the
   following: 1) privacy provided is insufficient as the email content or
   detection rules may be exposed to third parties; 2) due to improper use
   of encryption, exhaustive word search attacks are possible, potentially
   breaking the confidentiality of encrypted emails; 3) when spam filtering
   is outsourced, email is given to the outsource, where user privacy may
   be compromised if privacy protection measures are not properly put in
   place; 4) confirmation of whether the encrypted email is spam is only
   determined after the receiver receives the email, which can lead to a
   situation in which spam is loaded to the memory of the receiver's
   terminal for spam filtering. This can be harmful, for example, when an
   attacker inserts a web browser vulnerability into the body of an email
   to lure users to a phishing site simply by reading the email; 5)
   computationally expensive operations are unavoidable to provide required
   features of privacy-preserving spam filtering. We present
   Privacy-preserving Content-based Spam Filter (PCSF), which is a spam
   filter system that does not suffer from the aforementioned issues.
   Additionally, our system provides pre-validation before the receiver
   reads the email. We provide an implementation of our system based on the
   Naive Bayes spam filter and prove its security.},

Abstract = {The growth in use of Internet based systems over the past 20 years has
   seen a corresponding growth in criminal information technologies
   infrastructures. While previous ``worm{''} based attacks would push
   themselves onto vulnerable systems, a common form of attack is now that
   of drive-by download. In contrast to email or worm-based malware
   propagation, such drive-by attacks are stealthy as they are `invisible'
   to the user when doing general Web browsing. They also increase the
   potential victim base for attackers since they allow a way through the
   users firewall as the user initiates the connection to the Web page from
   within their own network. This paper introduces some key terminology
   relating to drive-by downloads and assesses the state of the art in
   technologies which seek to prevent these attacks. This paper then
   suggests that a proactive approach to preventing compromise is required.
   The roles of different stakeholders are examined in terms of efficacy
   and legal implications, and it is concluded that Web hosting providers
   are best placed to deal with the problem, but that the system of
   liability exemption deriving from the E-Commerce Directive reduces the
   incentive for these actors to adopt appropriate security practices. (C)

Abstract = {Thousands of cyber-attacks (fraudulent online activities to acquire
   users' sensitive information via email, during online transactions, live
   video streaming, online gaming and browsing) are launched every day
   against Internet users across the world. To prevent these attacks,
   researchers have responded with a number of protection systems.
   Currently, the methods which cyber-attackers use to conduct attacks is
   associated with exploiting humans. Such attacks are recorded more
   frequently than before, and they are more challenging to control.
   Traditional security countermeasures are unable to prevent breaches
   targeting the human element. This paper describes the state of the art
   of cyber security attacks, countermeasures, and protection tools related
   to everyday online activities. It provides a useful cyber-attack
   taxonomy and classification which helps to involve in a protection
   process to identify attacks and measures for cyber security. Existing
   protection schemes that target the cyber threats and risks are evaluated
   against three of our criteria for an effective measure: resilience to
   cyber-attacks' countermeasures; real-time support and needs-based
   action; and training and educational materials to increase users'
   awareness of cybercrimes. Potential features of smart solutions to
   cybercrime are also identified.},

Abstract = {BackgroundSyndromic management in the main non-laboratory-based
   management approach for sexually transmitted infections (STI) in most
   low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) but it has limitations.
   Self-sampling has been proven as a suitable alternative approach to help
   improve management STIs by improving access to diagnosis among
   vulnerable populations. We sought to determine health workers'
   perspectives on user-friendly self-sampling interventions for STIs among
   young women in eThekwini District Municipality.MethodsHealthcare workers
   providing STI healthcare services in the study location participated in
   a nominal group technique (NGT) workshop. The NGT workshop was aimed
   enabling collaboration with key health providers in identifying
   user-friendly self-sampling interventions for diagnosis of STIs among
   young women. Data collection was conducted in two phases: phase 1
   determined barrier that hinder young women from accessing current STI
   healthcare services and phase 2 focused on determining the key
   strategies for self-sampling interventions to diagnose STIs in young
   women. Thematic analysis and percentage form analysis were used to
   examine qualitative and quantitative data respectively.ResultsThe
   following barriers were identified: negligence; myths about STIs; fear
   of judgement; denial; operating hours; lack of knowledge of STI symptoms
   and safe sex practices; and stigma associated with STIs. The following
   strategies were suggested: hand out self-sampling kits at popular
   restaurants; collect self-sampling kits from security guard at primary
   healthcare clinics (PHCs); receive STI diagnostic results via SMS or
   email or the clinic for treatment; improve youth friendly services at
   PHCs; educate the public on proper use of the kits. Education about STIs
   and handing out self-sampling kits at clinics, universities, schools,
   pharmacies or via outreach teams were ranked high priority
   strategies.ConclusionsThe findings highlight the need to address stigma
   and fear of judgment and provide comprehensive education to improve
   healthcare-seeking behaviour in young women. Additionally, the study
   also indicates that using eHealth solutions could significantly enhance
   the accessibility and efficiency of STI healthcare services in LMICs.},

Title = {Development of an Active Training Method for Belt Conveyor},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The global situation related to the COVID-19 pandemic has forced
   employers to find an adequate way to conduct training in order to ensure
   work safety. The underground mining industry is one of the industries
   which, due to its nature, was not able to switch to remote work.
   Conducting traditional training risked spreading the virus among
   workers. For this purpose, it was necessary to start a search for a form
   of training that would be safe and would not cause additional stress for
   employees. Research on the development of an active employee training
   method and testing of the method itself was conducted online. In order
   to develop a method of active training, one of the most important
   workstations was selected, which is the operation of the conveyor belt.
   The training method comprises four training modules. The modules cover
   questions related to the operation of the conveyor belt, emergencies,
   its assembly and disassembly, repair and maintenance. The developed
   issues also take into account questions concerning natural hazards and
   work safety. The entire training course lasts 10 days. Every day, an
   employee receives a set of eight questions sent to their email address,
   which they must answer before starting work. The article describes the
   methodology and implementation of the training.},

Abstract = {Users' personally identifiable information (PII) collection is a primary
   revenue model for the app-economy, and consequently user tracking has
   become increasingly invasive and ubiquitous. Smart and IoT devices
   provide even more access to users' personal information by utilizing
   their exact location and default device settings. Although users in most
   cases must grant permission before their personal information is
   collected and shared with third-parties, this is not the case when user
   tracking happens through email or just by owning and using Bluetooth
   dependent devices. In any case, the average user is willing to accept
   the terms of the often unread ``Privacy Policy{''} in order to receive
   the advertised ``better user experience{''}, without really being aware
   of the consequences of this decision. In this work, we investigate the
   latest popular technologies for user tracking through mobile and web
   applications and demonstrate how much information about users can be
   gathered without user awareness or acknowledgment as well as in which
   cases and how we were able to limit this tracking. Finally, in our work,
   we attempt to create unified user profiles by combining our findings
   from the different tracking techniques against targeted users. We hope
   that our extensive analysis of beacon tracking will lead to greater
   awareness of the privacy risks involved with web beacons and Bluetooth
   tracking and motivate the deployment of stricter regulations and a more
   effective notification mechanism when such tracking is in place.},

Title = {An electronic pillbox intervention designed to improve medication safety
   during care transitions: challenges and lessons learned regarding
   implementation and evaluation},
Journal = {BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},

Month = {OCT 30},
Abstract = {Background Adverse drug events are common during transitions of care. As
   part of the Smart Pillbox study, a cluster-randomized controlled trial
   of an electronic pillbox designed to reduce medication discrepancies and
   improve medication adherence after hospital discharge, we explored
   barriers to successful implementation and evaluation of this
   intervention. Methods Eligible patients were those admitted to a
   medicine service of a large teaching hospital with a plan to be
   discharged home on five or more chronic medications. The intervention
   consisted of an electronic pillbox with pre-filled weekly blister pack
   medication trays given to patients prior to discharge. Pillbox features
   included alarms to take medications, detection of pill removal from each
   well, alerts to patients or caregivers by phone, email, or text if
   medications were not taken, and adherence reports accessible by
   providers. Greater than 20\% missed doses for three days in a row
   triggered outreach from a pharmacist. To identify barriers to
   implementation and evaluation of the intervention, we reviewed patient
   exit surveys, including quantitative data on satisfaction and free-text
   responses regarding their experiences; technical issue logs; and team
   meeting minutes. Themes were derived by consensus among the study
   authors and organized using the Consolidated Framework for
   Implementation Research. Results Barriers to implementation included
   intervention characteristics such as perceived portability issues with
   the pillbox and time required by pharmacists to enter medication
   information into the software; external policies such as lack of
   insurance coverage for early refills and regulatory prohibitions on
   repackaging medications; implementation climate issues such as the
   incompatibility between the rushed nature of hospital discharge with the
   time required to deploy the intervention; and patient issues such as
   denial of previous problems with medication adherence. We founds several
   obstacles to conducting the study, including patients declining study
   enrollment and limited attempts by the hospital to streamline logistics
   by building the intervention into usual care. Several solutions to
   address many of these challenges were implemented or planned. Despite
   these challenges, many patients with the pillbox were pleased with the
   service and believed the intervention worked well for them. Conclusions
   In this evaluation, several barriers to implementing and conducting a
   study of the effectiveness of the intervention were identified. Our
   findings provide lessons learned for others wishing to implement and
   evaluate HIT-related interventions designed to improve medication safety
   during care transitions.},

Abstract = {We introduce the concept of ``universal{''} password model-a password
   model that, once pre-trained, can automatically adapt its guessing
   strategy based on the target system. To achieve this, the model does not
   need to access any plain-text passwords from the target credentials.
   Instead, it exploits users' auxiliary information, such as email
   addresses, as a proxy signal to predict the underlying password
   distribution.
   Specifically, the model uses deep learning to capture the correlation
   between the auxiliary data of a group of users (e.g., users of a web
   application) and their passwords. It then exploits those patterns to
   create a tailored password model for the target system at inference
   time. No further training steps, targeted data collection, or prior
   knowledge of the community's password distribution is required.
   Besides improving over current password strength estimation techniques,
   the model enables any end-user (e.g., system administrators) to
   autonomously generate tailored password models for their systems without
   the often unworkable requirements of collecting suitable training data
   and fitting the underlying machine learning model. Ultimately, our
   framework enables the democratization of well-calibrated password models
   to the community, addressing a major challenge in the deployment of
   password security solutions at scale.},

Abstract = {Stack Overflow is a globally recognizable service features questions and
   answers on a wide range of topics in computer programming. Even though
   stackoverflow is not an anonymous service, users posting comments hope
   to not reveal personal email. Email, which according to EU laws is
   consider as a personal information. Unfortunately, emails are possible
   to recover, because stackoverflow provides them in the obfuscated form
   in source code. This article explains all stages of the real large-scale
   attack on Stack Overflow user emails. Those stages could be easily
   adopted to any website with comments system based on the Gravatar
   service. In our attack we crawled and were able to recover more than
   (1,25 M) 20\% real emails of the stackoverflow users.},

Abstract = {The current design of email authentication mechanisms has made it
   challenging for email providers to establish the authenticity of email
   messages with complicated provenance, such as in the case of forwarding
   or third-party sending services, where the purported sender of an email
   is different from the actual originator. Email service providers such as
   Gmail have tried to address this issue by deploying sender identity
   indicators (SIIs), which seek to raise users' awareness about where a
   message originated and encourage safe behavior from users. However, the
   success of such indicators depends heavily on user interpretation and
   behavior, and there exists no work that empirically investigates these
   aspects. In this work, we conducted an interactive survey (n=180) that
   examined user comprehension of and behavior changes prompted by Gmail's
   passive SII, the `via' indicator. Our quantitative analysis shows that
   although most participants (89\%) noticed the indicator, it did not have
   a significant impact on whether users would adopt safe behaviors.
   Additionally, our qualitative analysis suggests that once prompted to
   consider why `via' is presented, the domain name displayed after `via'
   heavily influenced participants' interpretation of the message `via' is
   communicating. Our work highlights the limitations of using passive
   indicators to assist users in making decisions about email messages with
   complicated provenance.},

Abstract = {Spam Filtering is an adversary application in which data can be
   purposely employed by humans to attenuate their operation. Statistical
   spam filters are manifest to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To
   evaluate security issues related to spam filtering numerous machine
   learning systems are used. For adversary applications some Pattern
   classification systems are ordinarily used, since these systems are
   based on classical theory and design approaches do not take into account
   adversarial settings. Pattern classification system display
   vulnerabilities (i.e. a weakness that grants an attacker to reduce
   assurance on system's information) to several potential attacks,
   allowing adversaries to attenuate their effectiveness. In this paper,
   security evaluation of spam email using pattern classifier during an
   attack is addressed which degrade the performance of the system.
   Additionally a model of the adversary is used that allows defining spam

Title = {Alerting about possible risks vs. blocking risky choices: A quantitative
   model and its empirical evaluation},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {97},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Alerting users about possible threats or blocking users' ability to
   perform potentially dangerous actions are two common ways to protect
   systems from the adverse effects of threats, such as malicious email
   attachments, fraudulent requests, or system malfunctions. We present a
   normative model of the effects of alerting and blocking on the value of
   the outcomes, on measures of risk-taking, and on the number of
   successful attacks. We compared warning and blocking systems and
   binaryand likelihood-alarm systems as a function of properties of the
   threats and the security system. We also compared model predictions to
   actual user behavior, as measured in a controlled experiment. The
   experimental results were generally in line with the normative model.
   However, the model predicted that the outcomes from blocking would
   always be worse or equal to those from warnings. The experiment,
   however, showed that blocking may have an advantage over warnings,
   because it leads to fewer undetected events (as predicted by the model),
   without significantly lowering the mean value of outcomes (the model
   predicts a lower value). We discuss practical implications regarding the
   use of blocking and alerting and the more general value of combining
   optimal decision models and empirical experiments for determining system
   designs. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to examine the effect of cybersecurity threat
   and efficacy upon click-through, response to a phishing attack:
   persuasion and protection motivation in an organizational context.
   Design/methodology/approach In a simulated field trial conducted in a
   financial institute, via PhishMe, employees were randomly sent one of
   five possible emails using a set persuasion strategy. Participants were
   then invited to complete an online survey to identify possible
   protective factors associated with clicking and reporting behavior (N =
   2,918). The items of interest included perceived threat severity, threat
   susceptibility, response efficacy and personal efficacy. Findings The
   results indicate that response behaviors vary significantly across
   different persuasion strategies. Perceptions of threat susceptibility
   increased the likelihood of reporting behavior beyond clicking behavior.
   Threat susceptibility and organizational response efficacy were also
   associated with increased odds of not responding to the simulated
   phishing email attack. Practical implications This study again
   highlights human susceptibility to phishing attacks in the presence of
   social engineering strategies. The results suggest heightened awareness
   of phishing threats and responsibility to personal cybersecurity are key
   to ensuring secure business environments. Originality/value The authors
   extend existing phishing literature by investigating not only
   click-through behavior, but also no-response and reporting behaviors.
   Furthermore, the authors observed the relative effectiveness of
   persuasion strategies used in phishing emails as they compete to
   manipulate unsafe email behavior.},

Abstract = {In the operational phase, an IoT device runs a light-weight server that
   is responsible for responding to the user queries, like accessing video
   and taking a snap in a IoT camera. The flaws in the implementation of
   certain security mechanisms in these IoT devices can lead to varying
   level of security threats. In this paper, we address the problems of
   discovering such vulnerabilities using effective fuzzing via crafted
   transport and upper layer protocol packets in IoT communication. We have
   designed and developed a mutation-based fuzzing tool, named
   IoTFuzzSentry, to discover certain non-trivial vulnerabilities in
   commercial IoT devices and demonstrate their potential exploits. We have
   used IoT devices, like IP cameras and Smart Plug. We have categorized
   the vulnerabilities into four types (IoT Credential Leakage (V1), Sneak
   IP camera live video stream (V2), Creep Live IoT Image (V3), IoT Command
   Injection (V4)) and show their exploits using three IoT devices. We have
   reported all these vulnerabilities to respective vendors via email. We
   believe that our IoTFuzzSentry has a great potential to discover such
   unconventional security threats and allow IoT vendors to strengthen the
   security of their commercialized devices.},

Abstract = {Objective: To examine how food insecurity is related to emerging adults'
   food behaviours and experiences of neighbourhood safety and
   discrimination and to identify resources needed to support their health
   during the COVID-19 outbreak.
   Design: Rapid response online survey. Participants completed the
   six-item US Household Food Security Survey Module, a brief measure of
   food insufficiency, and measures of food behaviours, neighbourhood
   safety and discrimination. Open-ended questions were used to assess
   changes in eating behaviours during COVID-19 and needed resources.
   Setting: C-EAT (COVID-19 Eating and Activity over Time) study
   invitations were sent by email and text message to a longitudinal
   cohort.
   Participants: A total of 218 emerging adults (mean age = 24.6 (sd 2.0)
   years, 70.2 \% female) completed a survey in April-May 2020 during a
   stay-at-home order in Minnesota.
   Results: The past year prevalence of food insecurity was 28.4 \%. Among
   food-insecure respondents, 41.0 \% reported both eating less and
   experiencing hunger due to lack of money in the past month.
   Food-insecure respondents were less likely than those who were food
   secure to have fruits/vegetables at home and more likely to have
   frequent fast-food restaurant meals, feel unsafe in their neighbourhood
   and experience discrimination during the stay-at-home order.
   Food-insecure adults reported changes including eating more food
   prepared at home, eating more take-out restaurant meals and purchasing
   more energy-dense snacks as a result of events related to COVID-19.
   Resources most needed to support their health included eligibility for
   more food assistance and relief funds.
   Conclusions: Food-insecure emerging adults experience many barriers to
   maintaining healthful eating patterns during COVID-19.},

Abstract = {Phishing assaults use websites and email messages similar to a familiar
   and genuine organization, so as to trick users into giving their
   financial or personal information online at the illegal websites.
   Phishing assaults look out at the various weak points that are present
   in systems and frameworks because of the human factor. There exist
   numerous cyber-attacks which are spread through different methods or
   schemes. They utilize these shortcomings found in end users, thus making
   the users as the most vulnerable component in terms of security. The
   phishing problem is extensive, expansive and till now there is no single
   answer to alleviate all the existing weak points effectively. This leads
   to implementation of multiple techniques to reduce specific attacks.
   This paper surveys the literature on the recently proposed anti-phishing
   techniques designed to detect and prevent phishing.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present the application of keystroke dynamics for
   continuous user authentication in desktop platform. We show the
   differences between static and continuous systems based on keystroke
   dynamics in terms of creating the template and authentication phase. The
   key factor in the continuous authentication system is monitoring the
   genuineness of the user during the whole session, and not only at
   log-in. Moreover, we propose a general approach for continuous
   authentication based on keystroke dynamics. In our experiments, we use
   the email application as a case study to present the effectiveness and
   efficiency of our proposed approach. Our main conclusion is that using
   keystroke dynamics can serve as a feasible and acceptable measure for
   continuous user authentication. The investigations have shown that it is
   feasible to authenticate users based on keystroke dynamics for
   continuous authentication systems.},

Abstract = {Phishing is by far the most common and disruptive type of cyber-attack
   faced by most organizations. Phishing messages may share common
   attributes such as the same or similar subject lines, the same sending
   infrastructure, similar URLs with certain parts slightly varied, and so
   on. Attackers use such strategies to evade sophisticated email filters,
   increasing the difficulty for computing support teams to identify and
   block all incoming emails during a phishing attack. Limited work has
   been done on grouping human-reported phishing emails, based on the
   underlying scam, to help the computing support teams better defend
   organizations from phishing attacks. In this paper, we explore the
   feasibility of using unsupervised clustering techniques to group emails
   into scams that could ideally be addressed together. We use a
   combination of contextual and semantic features extracted from emails
   and perform a comparative study on three clustering algorithms with
   varying feature sets. We use a range of internal and external validation
   methods to evaluate the clustering results on real-world email datasets.
   Our results show that unsupervised clustering is a promising approach
   for scam identification and grouping, and analyzing reported phishing
   emails is an effective way of mitigating phishing attacks and utilizing
   the human perspective.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveEffective health communication is critical for understanding
   and acting on health information. This cross-sectional study explored
   participants' understanding of their health condition, their preferences
   for receiving health communications, and their interest in receiving
   clinical trial results across several therapeutic areas.MethodsThe study
   recruited participants via social media, email newsletters, and advocacy
   organizations. An online screener captured demographic information
   (health conditions, age, race/ethnicity, gender, and education).
   Eligible participants were emailed an online survey assessing preferred
   sources and formats for receiving health information, interest in
   learning about topics related to the results of clinical trials, and
   health literacy levels.ResultsIn total, 449 participants (median age, 35
   years {[}range, 18-76]; White, 53\%; higher education, 65\%; mean
   (range) health literacy score, 1.9 {[}0.4-3.0]) from 45 US states
   completed the survey representing 12 disease indications (bipolar, blood
   and solid tumor cancers, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel
   disease, major depressive disorder, migraine, Parkinson's,
   psoriasis/atopic dermatitis, retinal vein occlusion/macular
   degeneration, rheumatoid arthritis, and spasticity). Healthcare
   providers were the preferred source of health information (59\%),
   followed by Internet searches (11\%). Least preferred sources were
   social media (5\%), friends/family (3\%), and email newsletters (2\%).
   Participants preferred multiple formats and ranked reading materials
   online as most preferred (33\%), along with videos (28\%) and
   infographics (27\%). Printed materials (14\%) and audio podcasts (9\%)
   were the least preferred formats. A majority of the participants
   reported that the health information they found was hard to understand
   (57\%) and confusing (62\%). Most participants (85\%) were somewhat/very
   interested in learning about clinical trial results, with the highest
   interest in short summaries of safety (78\%) and efficacy (74\%)
   results.ConclusionEffective health communication may be achieved via
   multiple formats shared directly by healthcare providers.
   Researchers wanted to learn how people preferred to receive
   health-related communications, including information about the results
   of clinical trials. They surveyed 449 people from 45 US states with 12
   different health conditions. The survey questions asked people about
   their preferred sources and ways of getting health information. It also
   asked about their interest in learning about clinical trials related to
   their health condition. The results showed that most people preferred to
   get health information from their healthcare providers (59\%). The
   Internet was the second most popular choice (11\%) for getting health
   information. People did not like getting health information from social
   media, friends or family, or email newsletters as much. When it came to
   how health information was shared, people liked reading materials online
   (33\%), watching videos (28\%), and looking at infographics (27\%). They
   did not like printed materials and audio podcasts as much. Most people
   (85\%) were interested in learning about the results of clinical trials
   in short summaries. They wanted to know about the safety (78\%) and how
   well the treatments worked (74\%) in the short summaries. In conclusion,
   people liked getting health information from healthcare providers like
   doctors, nurses, and others in different formats. Sharing information in
   different formats through healthcare providers may improve communication
   for patients with different health conditions.},

Abstract = {Given the increasing popularity of sandbox analysis, malware authors
   have adapted sandbox evasion functionalities into modern malware. In
   addition, attackers can create Customized Malware that hide their
   malicious payload until the identifier of the target-specific system can
   be verified. In this paper, we propose an attack scenario in which
   adversaries can leverage publicly available personally identifiable
   information present in the target system as specific identifiers. The
   proposed attack scenario can be used in targeted attacks, especially
   against hosts that store business email addresses on personal computers
   (PCs). We investigated a set of desktop applications and specified 18
   popular applications that store email addresses in their related files
   or directories. We also implemented a survey tool to access these
   applications and record whether email addresses were found. We then
   asked nine laboratory members and staff if the target-specific email
   address was found and if we could extract the same email address from
   each PC with 16 applications. Finally, we implemented a dummy malware
   sample that searches for the target host's email address from the
   executing environment and denies unpacking the malicious payload if the
   mark does not exist. The experiment results demonstrate that two modern
   malware security appliances did not detect the prototype sample. To
   defend against the proposed attack, we discuss countermeasures from both
   the sandbox and user perspective. We contacted security vendors to allow
   them to prepare for such attacks and provided POC programs.},

Title = {PhantomFS: File-Based Deception Technology for Thwarting Malicious Users},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {32203-32214},
Abstract = {File-based deception technologies can be used as an additional security
   barrier when adversaries have successfully gained access to a host
   evading intrusion detection systems. Adversaries are detected if they
   access fake files. Though previous works have mainly focused on using
   user data files as decoys, this concept can be applied to system files.
   If so, it is expected to be effective in detecting malicious users
   because it is very difficult to commit an attack without accessing a
   single system file. However, it may suffer from excessive false alarms
   by legitimate system services such as file indexing and searching.
   Legitimate users may also access fake files by mistake. This paper
   addresses this issue by introducing a hidden interface. Legitimate users
   and applications access files through the hidden interface which does
   not show fake files. The hidden interface can also be utilized to hide
   sensitive files by hiding them from the regular interface. By
   experiments, we demonstrate the proposed technique incurs negligible
   performance overhead, and it is an effective countermeasure to various
   attack scenarios and practical in that it does not generate false alarms
   for legitimate applications and users.},

   capacity: Gmail provides a large amount of storage space to each user.
   In this paper, we address the challenges in design and implementation of
   gVault. gVault is fundamentally designed keeping an average user in
   mind. We introduce a novel encrypted storage model and key management
   techniques that ensure data confidentiality and integrity. An initial
   prototype of gVault is implemented to evaluate the feasibility of such a
   system. Our experiments indicate that the additional cost of security is
   negligible in comparison to the cost of data transfer.},

Abstract = {This study explores the psychological aspects of social engineering by
   analyzing personality traits in the context of spear-phishing attacks.
   Phishing emails were constructed by leveraging multiple vulnerable
   personality traits to maximize the success of an attack. The emails were
   then used to test several hypotheses regarding phishing susceptibility
   by simulating a series of spear-phishing campaigns inside a software
   development company. The company's employees underwent a standard Big
   Five personality test, four different phishing emails over four weeks,
   and cybersecurity training. The results were aggregated before and after
   the cybersecurity course, and binary logistic regression analyses were
   performed at each phase of the phishing attack. The results show that
   personality traits correlate with phishing susceptibility under certain
   circumstances and pave the way for new methods of protecting individuals
   from phishing attacks.},

Abstract = {Despite technical advances in anti-phishing protection, in many cases
   the detection of phishing URLs largely depends on users manually
   inspecting the links found in suspicious emails. One solution proposed
   to support users in doing so is to use a URL formatting that focuses
   their attention on critical URL parts, such as domain and
   top-level-domain (called ``who-area{''}). While this solution has been
   implemented in several software products (e.g., browsers web address
   bar), research on its effectiveness with regard to phishing URL
   detection is currently limited. To investigate the extent to which
   different kinds of URL formatting support users to detect phishing URLs,
   we conducted an online study (n = 200) using interactive email
   screenshots with tooltips showing two previously evaluated URL
   formatting (called ``Who-Area Highlighting{''} and ``Who-Area Only{''}).
   A group with unmodified URLs (called ``Plain URL{''}) acted as control.
   We did not find any significant difference between the URL formatting
   within our sample, with successful phishing URL detection rates ranging
   from 71\% (for the unmodified URL) to 76\% (for showing only the URL
   who-area). As we designed a study with a ``best-case{''} scenario to
   detect a medium effect size (Cohen's r = .30), it is then likely that
   the URL formatting effect on phishing URL detection would be even
   smaller in the real world. Still, we found that other factors had a
   significant effect on users' phishing URL detection, namely,
   gender-related factors and forcing users' attention on the URL for 4-5
   seconds. However, these results are only preliminary and need further
   investigation.},

   input to semi-automatically generate persuasive messages encouraging
   behaviour change that follow specific argumentation patterns. We
   conducted user studies in the domains of healthy eating and email
   security to investigate its effectiveness. Our results show that
   ArguMessage in general supported users in generating messages based on
   the argumentation schemes. However, there were some issues in particular
   with copying the example messages, and some system improvements need to
   be made. Participants were generally satisfied with the messages
   produced, with the exception of those produced by two schemes (Argument
   from memory with goal' and `Argument from values with goal') which were
   removed after the first study.},

Abstract = {The deployment of AI systems has increased across several industries as
   they exhibit progressively stronger predictive performance. Due to
   safety, moral, and legal considerations, full automation is frequently
   undesirable. However, fully manual methods might be erroneous and
   time-consuming. The idea of using AI to support human decision-making is
   therefore gaining popularity in the scientific community. The
   flourishing subject of AI decision-making needs to embrace empirical
   methodologies in addition to building AI technologies for that purpose
   to establish a solid understanding of how people interact and
   collaborate with AI to make decisions. This research intends to analyse
   how artificial intelligence uses human judgment for decision-making in
   business. Researchers gathered survey results from high-tech employees
   in India via email, media, and other means. The sample size was 196, and
   the sampling strategy most likely employed was convenience sampling.
   With the data collected measurement and structural model are performed
   and found that artificial intelligence-based decision-making impacts the
   organizations' business value and artificial intelligence capability
   impacts the organization created with the moderating effect of business
   intelligence. Also, it is concluded that AI-based decision-making
   impacts knowledge management.},

   Protocol and Advanced Features for Smart Buildings},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE ENERGY RESEARCH},

Abstract = {-The use of renewable energy sources near the load centres brought the
   concept of building power systems. Further, the modern smart buildings
   increase operational efficiency, safety, and consumer comfort, where,
   all the operations are monitored/controlled by central monitoring and
   control unit (CMCU). For reliable communication between the components
   of smart building and the CMCU, a well-established network with advanced
   features such as user alerts, usage details, remote control, link
   failure handling, security, etc., is essential. However, the
   conventional IoT network can't provide all these features, especially
   the fault tolerance, where, communication failure is usually observed in
   remote control operations when there exists any link failure. This is
   the major drawback of conventional networks. To overcome this issue,
   this paper proposes a retrofitted IoT based communication network with
   Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) for remote monitoring and control of
   smart building devices. This proposed network provides a redundant path
   during the link failures, thereby ensures reliable communication in the
   network. This is the major contribution of this paper. Besides, this
   network possesses advanced features viz., Adaptive Security Appliance
   (ASA) firewall to provide intrusion prevention (blocking unauthorized
   packets), Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol to enable
   the broker for broadcasting messages to all the subscribers of a
   particular topic, and email alert to provide communication between
   different users. Altogether, this proposed communication network
   enhances the reliability of smart buildings, which is simulated and
   verified using Cisco Packet Tracer 7.3.1. The results show that the
   proposed HSRP based network performance is better than the conventional
   network.},

Abstract = {Detecting and correcting network and service availability issues is an
   essential part of the network administrator's daily duty. One of the
   causes of errors can be the user herself providing incorrect input. The
   present work describes a new diagnostic method that detects incorrectly
   inserted inputs observed in network-related data, e.g., network traffic,
   log files. The proposed method aims to detect incorrect words in
   domains, login names, or email addresses. First, we describe how to
   detect possible incorrect words. For each such detected word, a list of
   correct candidates is created based on edit distance. Next, the
   correction method selects the best word by scoring candidates based on
   the probability of occurrence in the given context. The proposed method
   was implemented as a prototype and tested on words created using real
   user activities. The evaluation demonstrates that this approach can
   substantially reduce the time needed to identify this kind of errors.},

Title = {Improving health outcomes for young people with long term conditions:
   The role of digital communication in current and future
   patient-clinician communication for NHS providers of specialist clinical
   services for young people - LYNC study protocol},
Journal = {DIGITAL HEALTH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {1},
Month = {JAN-DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Young people living with long term conditions are vulnerable
   to health service disengagement. This endangers their long term health.
   Studies report requests for digital forms of communication - email,
   text, social media - with their health care team. Digital clinical
   communication is troublesome for the UK NHS.
   Aim: In this article we aim to present the research protocol for
   evaluating the impacts and outcomes of digital clinical communications
   for young people living with long term conditions and provide critical
   analysis of their use, monitoring and evaluation by NHS providers (LYNC
   study: Long term conditions, Young people, Networked Communications).
   Methods: The research involves: (a) patient and public involvement
   activities with 16-24 year olds with and without long term health
   conditions; (b) six literature reviews; (c) case studies - the main
   empirical part of the study - and (d) synthesis and a consensus meeting.
   Case studies use a mixed methods design. Interviews and non-participant
   observation of practitioners and patients communicating in up to 20
   specialist clinical settings will be combined with data, aggregated at
   the case level (non-identifiable patient data) on a range of clinical
   outcomes meaningful within the case and across cases. We will describe
   the use of digital clinical communication from the perspective of
   patients, clinical staff, support staff and managers, interviewing up to
   15 young people and 15 staff per case study. Outcome data includes
   emergency admissions, A\&E attendance and DNA (did not attend) rates.
   Case studies will be analysed to understand impacts of digital clinical
   communication on patient health outcomes, health care costs and
   consumption, ethics and patient safety.},

Abstract = {In recent times, the integration of technology in everyday tasks helps
   in making most of the cumbersome work more convenient. This integration
   has brought about a positive wave in aiding and assisting humans in
   various sectors such as the military, health, education, finance, etc.
   Conversely, convenience does come with a cost, i.e. it increases the
   concern for security in those systems. Attackers with various motives
   try to exploit these systems for personal gain. Some of the popular
   attacks like Man In The Middle, Cross-Site Request Forgery(CSRF),
   Phishing and Code Injection can be used to compromise the systems.
   However, the easiest way to gain control over a system is through Social
   engineering because it can be performed within a short time and without
   much technical expertise. Social Engineering targets humans by using
   various psychological weaknesses of human cognizance. Such attacks are
   often used to attack enterprises, as their weakest links are the human
   employees who are prone to be deceived and manipulated. Hence, the
   enterprise must be prepared for any kind of attack that may be deployed
   to exploit the weaknesses. This paper discusses the broad spectrum of
   Social Engineering threats that an enterprise faces throughout its life
   and various effective measures to prevent such attacks. This paper helps
   the reader to gain insight into how social engineering can be used
   against enterprises.},

Title = {A Technology Acceptance Model for Deploying Masks to Combat the COVID-19
   Pandemic in Taiwan (My Health Bank): Web-Based Cross-sectional Survey
   Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Background: The successful completion of medical practices often relies
   on information collection and analysis. Government agencies and medical
   institutions have encouraged people to use medical information
   technology (MIT) to manage their conditions and promote personal health.
   In 2014, Taiwan established the first electronic personal health record
   (PHR) platform, My Health Bank (MHB), which allows people to access and
   manage their PHRs at any time. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic in
   2020, Taiwan has used MIT to effectively prevent the spread of COVID-19
   and undertaken various prevention measures before the onset of the
   outbreak. Using MHB to purchase masks in an efficient and orderly way
   and thoroughly implementing personal protection efforts is highly
   important to contain disease spread.
   Objective: This study aims to understand people's intention to use the
   electronic PHR platform MHB and to investigate the factors affecting
   their intention to use this platform.
   Methods: From March 31 to April 9, 2014, in a promotion via email and
   Facebook, participants were asked to fill out a structured questionnaire
   after watching an introductory video about MHB on YouTube. The
   questionnaire included seven dimensions: perceived usefulness, perceived
   ease of use, health literacy, privacy and security, computer
   self-efficacy, attitude toward use, and behavioral intention to use.
   Each question was measured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from
   ``strongly disagree{''} (1 point) to ``strongly agree{''} (5 points).
   Descriptive statistics and structural equation analysis were performed
   using SPSS 21 and AMOS 21 software.
   Results: A total of 350 valid questionnaire responses were collected
   (female: 219/350, 62.6\%; age: 21-30 years: 238/350, 68.0\%;
   university-level education: 228/350, 65.1\%; occupation as student:
   195/350, 56.6\%; average monthly income <NT \$30,000 {[}<US \$1054.89]:
   230/350, 65.7\%; residence in northern Taiwan: 236/350, 67.4\%; and
   health status perceived as ``good{''}: 171/350, 48.9\%). Five
   indicators, including chi-square test (X-310(2)=2.63), goodness-of-fit
   index (0.85), adjusted goodness-of-fit index (0.81), comparative fit
   index (0.91), and root mean square error of approximation (0.07), were
   calculated. The results indicated a good fit. Further analysis indicated
   that the most important factor affecting respondents' behavioral
   intention to use MHB was their attitude toward use (0.78), followed by
   perceived ease of use (0.65), perceived usefulness (0.41), health
   literacy (0.10), and privacy and security (0.07).
   Conclusions: From the perspective of the populace, this study explored
   the factors affecting the use of MHB and constructed an interpretation
   model with a strong goodness of fit. The results of our analysis are
   consistent with the technology acceptance model. Through the diverse
   value-added services of MHB, Taiwan's experience in pandemic prevention
   with smart technology can facilitate future responses to unknown,
   emerging infectious diseases.},

Abstract = {This paper is related to the introduction of Payment Services Directive
   2 (PSD2) and associated with it Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) and
   dynamic linking mechanisms. As a consequence of these regulations, some
   of the transaction authorization methods (aka TANs) must be withdrawn -
   for instance regular hardware tokens or printed one-time passwords
   cards. We propose easy to implement adjustment for well-known
   hardware-based tokens, which make them PSD2 compliant. As a
   proof-of-concept for our solution, we incorporated our designed protocol
   based on TOTP (Time -based One Time Password) algorithm and prepared a
   working prototype in a form of full operating system example. During our
   investigation we showed that users do not have to rely on One Time
   Password (OTP) mechanisms based on Short Message Service (SMS) codes or
   smartphone applications for generating TANs, which are forced by
   financial institutions and raises doubts regarding the 1 evel of
   security or availability. In our approach, we divide communications
   channels between bank and user into three independent parts
   {[}web-service (two-ways, main channel), text message/email (one way,
   notification c hannel), h ardware t oken (one way, OTP generating
   channel)]. Corrupting one of the channels is not enough to take over the
   control of the user bank account. We designed our solution with respect
   to client privacy and even possession of cellphone is not mandatory to
   use it.},

Abstract = {The Electronic messaging is a widely used network application, and the
   user's authentication is a necessary aspect. Commonly employed
   approaches include PKI and S/MIME encryption protocols for email, but
   have many security threats, such as EFAIL and attack MITM attack. The
   innovative property of blockchain minimizes these threats and provides
   decentralized sensitive operations along with high security. It
   terminates the need of trusted intermediaries. Smart contracts are
   implementation of second generation of blockchain technology. The
   objective of our work is to provide a secure peer to peer messaging
   solution. In this paper, we explain how blockchain would ensure secure
   communications, and also, we have designed a model for messaging system
   that ensures good performance and data security which verifies the user
   identities and their public keys, and also validate the user
   certificate. The proposed messaging system is decentralized in nature
   and allows secure messages exchange.},

Abstract = {Information system design and implementation are key factors for
   electronic participatory processes and procedures. How information
   systems are designed does not only affect the procedures but also
   influences the trust building between organizers, operators and
   participants. In addition, the implementation often has to adhere to
   legal standards. In this paper, we aim to investigate current practice
   of data use in online participations. In particular, a qualitative
   analysis is conducted and 18 online participations are investigated on
   their data use, i.e. use of participant information, cookies and web
   analytics. The results show that most projects require and request data
   during site visits (e.g., IP address, browser type) and for active
   participation (e.g., name, email). The real benefit, however, for the
   use of web analytics is often unclear. Furthermore, often proprietary
   solutions for web analytics are used, even tough open source solutions
   (i.e. that store data locally) exist. For future projects, it is
   recommended to not only define but also keep privacy policies updated
   (according to the used technology) and to specify the purpose and goals
   of using web analytics.},

Abstract = {Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver installed in motor vehicles
   have been used to track vehicles. The position of vehicle is transmitted
   via a wireless network using cellular telephone network known as GSM
   (Global System for Mobile communication). A vehicle that has GPS
   receiver installed onboard connected with GPRS modem and connected to a
   computer system in the Internet can be monitored and then provide alert
   when it travels outside the predefined area. This area is very important
   for many situations such as city car rental, trucking company to send
   goods from one city to another and logistic company with many fleets.
   The system designed here is a module with a GPS and a GPRS already
   integrated in one module. The output of the GPS receiver is connected to
   a microcontroller. The microcontroller dictates which data is collected
   via the GPS receiver and then sends the information to a computer system
   via GPRS modem. The microcontroller also receives command from the
   computer system via the GPRS connection and then can acct accordingly,
   such as change the frequency of geo-coordinate or turn the vehicle
   engine off if necessary. This device will help the user to track its
   vehicle via Google Map with the GPS coordinate data sent to the database
   server every 10. This device will enable the operator to turn off the
   vehicle engine and one other device onboard the vehicle if necessary.
   With the feature of Geofence on the Web server using HTML5, a virtual
   fence has been built around the Google Map and when the vehicle moving
   outside the fence the user can be alerted either via email or color
   change on the web page. The device has been tested and shown to be
   working with all the conditioned mentioned above. The computer system
   that displays the web page together with the geofence has been developed
   and shown to be working properly as indicated.},

Abstract = {Smart devices and people existing on the internet are connected to smart
   objects or things in the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. To protect
   the user information, it is required to detect malicious actions in the
   IoT environment. Even though different threat detection methods are
   introduced in the IoT technology, detecting malicious activity is still
   a significant challenge in the communication network. Hence, in this
   research work, an effective Cuckoo Search Chicken Swarm (CSCS)
   optimisation algorithm is proposed to detect the malicious threat in the
   network effectively. At first, the user activity information is
   simulated from the IoT network and stored in the user activity log. The
   user activity log file is forwarded to the feature extraction module,
   where the features, like logon, device, file, email, and Hypertext
   Transfer Protocol (HTTP) are extracted using the window length. For each
   user, the features are extracted with respect to the time stamp. Then,
   the dynamic feature index is constructed, and the threat detection is
   performed using the deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classifier, which
   is trained using the proposed CSCS algorithm. The proposed CSCS
   algorithm is designed by integrating the Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm
   and the Chicken Swarm Optimisation (CSO) algorithm. Moreover, the
   proposed algorithm attained better performance with respect to the
   metrics, like namely F1-score, precision, and recall as 0.915, 0.975,
   and 0.884 by varying the k-value and 0.9286, 0.9235, and 0.9337 by
   varying the training data using window size as 10, respectively.},

Abstract = {Background: Uncontrolled asthma poses substantial negative personal and
   health system impacts. Web-based technologies, including smartphones,
   are novel means to enable evidence-based care and improve patient
   outcomes.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to design, develop, and assess the
   utilization of an asthma collaborative self-management (CSM) platform
   (breathe) using content based on international evidence-based clinical
   guidelines.
   Methods: We designed and developed breathe as a Web-based mobile health
   (mHealth) platform accessible on smartphones, tablets, or desktop with
   user-centered design methods and International Organization for
   Standardization-certified quality development processes. Moreover,
   breathe was envisioned as a multifunctional, CSM mHealth platform, with
   content based on international clinical practice guidelines and
   compliant with national privacy and security specifications. The system
   enabled CSM (patient, provider, and breathe) and self-monitoring of
   asthma patients through (1) assessment of asthma control, (2) real-time
   access to a dynamic asthma action plan, (3) access to real-time
   environmental conditions, and (4) risk-reduction messaging. The data
   collection protocol collected user data for 12 months, with clinic
   visits at baseline and 6 and 12 months. Utilization outcomes included
   user interactions with the platform, user impressions, self-reported
   medication use, asthma symptom profile, reported peak flow measurement,
   and the delivery and impact of email reminders.
   Results: We enrolled 138 patients with a mean age of 45.3 years to
   receive the breathe intervention. Majority were female (100/138,
   72.5\%), had a smartphone (92/138, 66.7\%), and had a mean Asthma
   Control Test score of 18.3 (SD 4.9). A majority reported that breathe
   helped in the management of their asthma. Moreover, breathe scored 71.1
   (SD 18.9) on the System Usability Scale. Overall, 123 patients had
   complete usage analytics datasets. The platform sent 7.96 reminder
   emails per patient per week (pppw), patients accessed breathe 3.08
   times, journaled symptoms 2.56 times, reported medication usage 0.30
   times, and reported peak flow measurements 0.92 times pppw. Furthermore,
   breathe calculated patients' action plan zone of control 2.72 times
   pppw, with patients being in the green (well-controlled) zone in 47.71\%
   (8300/17,396) of the total calculations. Usage analysis showed that
   67.5\% (83/123) of the participants used the app at week 4 and only
   57.7\% (71/123) by week 45. Physician visits, email reminders, and aged
   50 years and above were associated with higher utilization.
   Conclusions: Individuals with asthma reported good usability and high
   satisfaction levels, reacted to breathe notifications, and had
   confidence in the platform's assessment of asthma control. Strong
   utilization was seen at the intervention's initiation, followed by a
   rapid reduction in use. Patient reminders, physician visits, and being
   aged 50 years and above were associated with higher utilization.},

Abstract = {Sites like Facebook and Google now serve as de facto data brokers,
   aggregating data on users for the purpose of implementing powerful
   advertising platforms. Historically, these services allowed advertisers
   to select which users see their ads via targeting attributes. Recently,
   most advertising platforms have begun allowing advertisers to target
   users directly by uploading the personal information of the users who
   they wish to advertise to (e.g., their names, email addresses, phone
   numbers, etc.); these services are often known as custom audiences.
   Custom audiences effectively represent powerful linking mechanisms,
   allowing advertisers to leverage any PII (e.g., from customer data,
   public records, etc.) to target users.
   In this paper, we focus on Facebook's custom audience implementation and
   demonstrate attacks that allow an adversary to exploit the interface to
   infer users' PII as well as to infer their activity. Specifically, we
   show how the adversary can infer users' full phone numbers knowing just
   their email address, determine whether a particular user visited a
   website, and de-anonymize all the visitors to a website by inferring
   their phone numbers en masse. These attacks can be conducted without any
   interaction with the victim(s), cannot be detected by the victim(s), and
   do not require the adversary to spend money or actually place an ad. We
   propose a simple and effective fix to the attacks based on reworking the
   way Facebook de-duplicates uploaded information. Facebook's security
   team acknowledged the vulnerability and has put into place a fix that is
   a variant of the fix we propose. Overall, our results indicate that
   advertising platforms need to carefully consider the privacy
   implications of their interfaces.},

Abstract = {Smart cards are convenient and secure. They protect sensitive
   information (e.g., private keys) from malicious applications. However,
   they do not protect the owner from abuse of the smart card: An
   application could for example cause a smart card to digitally sign any
   message, at any time, without the knowledge of the owner.
   In this paper we suggest that small, hand-held computers can be used
   instead of smart cards. They can communicate with the user directly and
   therefore do not exhibit the above mentioned problem.
   We have implemented smart card functionality for a 3COM PalmPilot. Our
   implementation is a PKCS\#11 module that plugs into Netscape
   Communicator and takes about 5 seconds to sign an email message.
   Generalizing from this experience, we argue that applications that are
   split: between a PC and a hand-held device can be more secure. While
   such an application remains fast and convenient to use, it gains
   additional security assurances from the fact that part of it runs on a
   trusted device.},

Abstract = {Security and privacy concerns when using cloud computing services are
   similar to those of the traditional noncloud services. Cloud Computing
   represents dynamic area during present days with new security level and
   trust. In this paper, we have analyzed the authentication techniques
   adopted by the users. There are various cloud computing issues like
   security, privacy, trust etc. which should be solved quickly to increase
   the user trust in cloud-based services. There are so many techniques to
   secure data in cloud like user id and password, pattern lock system,
   biometric system, one-time password (OTP) via email or SMS etc. Through
   this paper, we have tried to analyze how multifactor authentication
   techniques are adopted by end users. The result obtained after the
   analysis related to authentication techniques adopted and preferred by
   the users are given using various visual summaries.},

Title = {Contacting authors to retrieve individual patient data: study protocol
   for a randomized controlled trial},
Journal = {TRIALS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {17},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Background: Individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis is considered
   the ``gold standard{''} for exploring the effectiveness of interventions
   in different subgroups of patients. However, obtaining IPD is
   time-consuming and contact with the researchers responsible for the
   original trials is usually required. To date, there are no studies
   evaluating different strategies to optimize the process for retrieval of
   IPD from such researchers. Our aim is to examine the impact of providing
   incentives to the researchers responsible for the trials eligible for a
   meta-analysis to submit their IPD.
   Methods/Design: We updated our previously published systematic reviews
   for type 1 diabetes mellitus comparing long-and intermediate-acting
   insulin regimens (from January 2013 to June 2015) and for Alzheimer's
   dementia comparing cognitive enhancers (from January 2015 to May 2015).
   Eligible were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) fulfilling the
   eligibility criteria of the systematic reviews. We will randomly
   allocate authors of the reports of these RCTs into an intervention or
   control group. Those allocated to the intervention group will be
   contacted by email, mail, and phone, and will be asked to provide the
   IPD from their RCT and will be given a financial incentive. Those
   allocated to the control group will be contacted by email, mail, and
   phone, but will not receive a financial incentive. Our primary outcome
   will be the proportion of authors who provide the IPD. The secondary
   outcomes will be the time to return the dataset (defined as the period
   between the information request and the authors' response with the
   dataset), and completeness of data. We will compare the response rates
   in the two groups using the odds ratio and the corresponding 95 \%
   confidence interval. We will also use binary logistic regression and cox
   regression analyses to examine whether different RCT characteristics,
   such as study size and sponsor information, influence the probability of
   providing IPD and the time needed to share the data.
   Discussion: This study will determine whether a financial incentive
   affects response rates when seeking IPD from the original researchers.
   We will disseminate our findings in an open access scientific journal
   and present results at national and international conferences.},

Abstract = {The emergence of online services in our daily lives has been accompanied
   by a range of malicious attempts to trick individuals into performing
   undesired actions, often to the benefit of the adversary. The most
   popular medium of these attempts is phishing attacks, mainly through
   emails and websites. In order to defend against such attacks, there is
   an urgent need for automated mechanisms to identify this malicious
   content before it reaches users. Machine learning techniques have
   gradually become the standard for such classification problems. However,
   identifying common measurable features of phishing content (e.g., in
   emails) is notoriously difficult. To address this problem, we engage in
   a novel study into a phishing content classifier based on a recurrent
   neural network (RNN), which identifies such features without human
   input. At this stage, we scope our research to emails, but our approach
   can be extended to apply to websites. Our results show that the proposed
   system outperforms state-of-the-art tools. Furthermore, our classifier
   is efficient and takes into account only the text and, in particular,
   the textual structure of the email. Since these features are rarely
   considered in email classification, we argue that our classifier can
   complement existing classifiers with high information gain.},

Abstract = {Identity leakage is the public disclosure of user accounts that were
   stolen from an online service provider, e.g. email adresses and
   passwords. Identity leakage is an emerging threat to the security of
   user accounts because the number of online identities grows notably
   faster than the amount of used email adresses and passwords.
   In order to protect users against potential identity thefts after a
   cyber heist, a system that proactively warns the victims seems
   inevitable. In the design of such a system, there are technical, legal
   and psychological goals, e.g., the system has to fulfill the General
   Data Protection Regulation and users do not want to be flooded with
   warnings about potential identity thefts.
   In this paper, we propose a warning management system for online service
   providers that want to cooperate whilst keeping their users' data
   private from each other. Most importantly, victims will be informed only
   once if their user identity was found in an identity leak and the
   cooperating service providers preserve the privacy of the victims by
   design. Therefore, our warning system complies with the NIST
   recommendation.},

Abstract = {The Metaverse is a user-generated virtual world, aiming to provide
   highly personalized experiences for users. A product personalization
   design platform is a critical direction for the Metaverse's future
   development, enhancing user experience by offering personalized
   services. Blockchain technology ensures the security and privacy of user
   data, and enables personalized services through smart contracts,
   offering opportunities for personalization platforms. However,
   blockchain's decentralization can lead to excessive product data,
   resulting in ineffective data management and optimization, subsequently
   confusing personalized product design styles, which diminishes user
   experience. To address these issues, this study proposes the product
   style automatic generation system (PSAGS), centered on an image
   generation unit. The system outputs images with style information based
   on the input product text, achieving precise quantization and
   visualization of product styles, thereby enhancing user engagement and
   loyalty to the Metaverse. The image generation unit, with a
   standardization module can standardize the product style, namely, the
   relationship between product design elements and user emotions,
   addressing the problem of managing vast style data due to blockchain's
   decentralization. The generation module utilizes a diffusion model
   enhanced with contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) to generate
   style images, deepening the Metaverse experience. Optimizations include
   dilation convolution in the UNet architecture to enhance image quality
   and fine-grained CLIP transformations for improved image and text
   alignment. Results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in
   streamlining design processes and improving image quality in
   personalized product design, with wide applications in the Metaverse.},

Title = {A Survey of Ransomware Detection Methods},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {57943-57982},
Abstract = {Ransomware attacks continue to pose a significant challenge to
   cybersecurity, causing substantial financial and reputational damage to
   individuals and organizations. These attacks typically encrypt user data
   and demand a ransom for its release. There is a growing need for more
   effective and dynamic detection methods, especially for zero-day and
   unknown ransomware variants. This survey focuses on ransomware-detecting
   methods published from 2019 to 2025. One hundred thirty-five papers were
   reviewed and filtered based on their scope and publication venue. For
   in-depth analysis, this survey selected 45 papers focusing on ransomware
   detection for Windows or Android operating systems. This paper aims to
   comprehensively review existing ransomware detection methods, focusing
   on their effectiveness, limitations, and applicability. The detection
   methods are categorized into machine-learning-based and
   non-machine-learning-based methods, discussing the advantages and
   drawbacks of each. The paper also highlights ransomware-as-a-service,
   explaining what it is, how it works, and how it affects the increasing
   number of ransomware attacks in recent years. It also studies the
   datasets used in the reviewed literature, listing their structures and
   limitations. This survey identifies gaps in current research and
   suggests future directions for developing more robust ransomware
   detection systems.},

Abstract = {Collaborative e-Science applications often need to manage large numbers
   of user identities, profiles, and groups. However, developing and
   maintaining such capabilities is often challenging given the plethora of
   security protocols available and requirements for scalable, robust, and
   highly available implementations. Globus Nexus is a professionally
   hosted Platform-as-a-Service that provides these capabilities for
   collaborative e-Science applications, with a particular focus on the
   needs of scientific communities. It provides features such as identity
   provisioning, identity federation, profile management, user-oriented
   group management, and branded web interfaces that are important to many
   e-Science applications. Globus Nexus implements best practices
   approaches for each of these features for example using delegated
   security protocols such as OAuth; provides sophisticated workflows for
   actions such as email validation; and implements complex user-defined
   policies regarding permissible actions. We present here Globus Nexus'
   capabilities, motivate design choices, and present results that
   characterize the scalability, reliability, and availability of its
   implementation and deployment.},

Title = {Community engagement in the development and implementation of a rural
   road safety campaign: Steps and lessons learned},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT \& HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Introduction: Rural crashes result in fatality rates twice as high as
   urban, after accounting for vehicle miles traveled, and those involving
   farm vehicles tend to be the most severe. Farm vehicle crash
   interventions have focused on the farm equipment (e.g., lighting and
   marking) or the farm vehicle operator (e.g., training), despite crashes
   being most frequently caused by other vehicle driver actions.
   Community-based campaigns focused on rural drivers have potential to
   influence driver behavior. The objective of this study was to describe
   the role, formation, and lessons learned from a community advisory board
   (CAB) in the development and dissemination of a community-based rural
   roadway safety campaign. Methods: The CAB provided campaign input
   through quarterly meetings and email. The campaign had three main CAB
   and crash data-informed messages: 1) Slow Down, 2) Leave More Space, and
   3) Avoid Passing. The CAB led campaign activities to publicize the
   message, distribute swag, and organize event logistics. To evaluate CAB
   effectiveness and inform future community engagement efforts, we
   conducted in-depth, semi-structured telephone interviews with CAB
   members in July 2020. Interviews were transcribed, coded, and codes were
   categorized into five main themes. Results: Overall, CAB membership was
   described as an overwhelmingly positive experience in terms of the CAB
   structure, culture fostered among the group, responsibilities, and time
   commitment. Board members reported successful campaign implementation,
   gave positive feedback regarding the research team's engagement efforts,
   and provided valuable recommendations for future campaigns (e.g., adding
   social media components, expansion of CAB age and industry diversity,
   and increasing group bonding activities). Conclusions: Results from this
   study demonstrate the instrumental role and logistics involved in
   engagement of community advisors for the development and implementation
   of a rural roadway safety campaign. Steps and lessons from this study
   can be applied to other community-level injury and violence prevention
   topics, with a particular focus on rural communities.},

Title = {Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Detection in the Unstructured

Abstract = {Personally Identifiable Information (PII) has gained much attention with
   the rapid development of technologies and the exploitation of
   information relating to an individual. The corporates and other
   organizations store a large amount of information that is primarily
   disseminated in the form of emails that include personnel information of
   the user, employee, and customers. The security aspects of PII storage
   have been ignored, raising serious security concerns onindividual
   privacy. A significant concern arises about comprehending the
   responsibilities regarding the uses of PII. However, in real-time
   scenarios, email data is regarded as unstructured text data, detecting
   PII from such an unstructured large text corpus is quite challenging.
   This paper presents an intelligent clustering approach for automatically
   detecting personally identifiable information (PII) from a large text
   corpus. The focus of the proposed study is to design a model that
   receives text content and detects possible PII attributes. Therefore,
   this paper presents a clustering-based PII Model (C-PPIM) based on NLP
   and unsupervised learning to address detection of PH in the unstructured
   large text corpus. NLP is used to perform topic modeling, and Byte
   mLSTM, a different approach of sequence model, is implemented to address
   clustering problems in PII detection. The performance analysis of the
   proposed model is carried out existing hierarchical clustering
   concerning silhouette and cohesion score. The outcome indicated the
   effectiveness of the proposed system that highlights significant PH
   attributes, with significant scope in real-time implementation. In
   contrast, existing techniques are too expensive to function and fit in
   real-time environments.},

Abstract = {Online interactions typically require a user to input personally
   identifiable information (PII) such as their name, email, and
   demographic characteristics. The service provider may then use that PII
   to send correspondence to the user's email address or phone number,
   either through themselves or a third party. This study aims to create a
   tentative framework for measuring political bias within PII-harnessing
   communications. Three distinct spheres of analysis (time, corporate
   political values, and foreign senders) are utilized to develop this
   system of measurement. Although the results of a small-scale test of our
   method were inconclusive, our process for quantitatively measuring
   political bias nonetheless serves as a proof of concept that can be
   applied to future research.},

Title = {Understanding Users' Behavior towards Applications Privacy Policies},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Recently, smartphone usage has increased tremendously, and smartphones
   are being used as a requirement of daily life, equally by all age
   groups. Smartphone operating systems such as Android and iOS have made
   it possible for anyone with development skills to create apps for
   smartphones. This has enabled smartphone users to download and install
   applications from stores such as Google Play, App Store, and several
   other third-party sites. During installation, these applications request
   resource access permissions from users. The resources include hardware
   and software like contact, memory, location, managing phone calls,
   device state, messages, camera, etc. As per Google's permission policy,
   it is the responsibility of the user to allow or deny any permissions
   requested by an app. This leads to serious privacy violation issues when
   an app gets illegal permission granted by a user (e.g., an app might
   request for granted map permission and there is no need for map
   permission in the app, and someone can thereby access your location by
   this app). This study investigates the behavior of the user when it
   comes to safeguarding their privacy while installing apps from Google
   Play. In this research, first, seven different applications with
   irrelevant permission requests were developed and uploaded to two
   different Play Store accounts. The apps were live for more than 12
   months and data were collected through Play Store analytics as well as
   the apps' policy page. The preliminary data analysis shows that only
   20\% of users showed concern regarding their privacy and security either
   through interaction with the development team through email exchange or
   through commenting on the platform and other means accordingly.},

Abstract = {PurposeColorectal cancer screening is recommended starting at age 45,
   but there has been little research on strategies to promote screening in
   patients younger than 50.MethodsAn outreach program quasi-randomly
   assigned patients aged 45-50 without recent fecal immunochemical test
   (FIT), colonoscopy or contraindications to screening to two intervention
   arms: electronic outreach with email and text (electronic outreach only)
   versus electronic outreach plus mailed outreach with FIT, an
   instructional letter and a prepaid return envelope (mailed + electronic
   outreach). In response to known disparities in screening uptake, all
   Black patients were assigned to receive mailed + electronic
   outreach.ResultsAmong patients quasi-randomly assigned to an
   intervention (non-Black patients), the 180-day FIT completion rate was
   18.8\% in the electronic outreach only group (n = 1,318) and 25.0\% in
   the mailed + electronic outreach group (n = 1,364) (difference 6.2\%
   {[}95\% CI 3.0, 9.4]). FIT completion was 16.6\% among Black patients (n
   = 469), 8.4\% (95\% CI 4.1, 12.6) lower than among non-Black patients
   also assigned to mailed + electronic outreach.ConclusionAmong patients
   aged 45-50, mailed + electronic outreach had a greater effect on FIT
   completion than electronic outreach alone. Crossover between
   intervention groups likely lead to an underestimation of the effect of
   mailed outreach.},

Abstract = {CCTV-based surveillance using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is
   considered a key technology for security in smart city environments.This
   article creates a case where the UAVs with CCTV-cameras fly over the
   city area for flexible and reliable surveillance services. UAVs should
   be deployed to cover a large area while minimizing overlapping and
   shadow areas for a reliable surveillance system. However, the operation
   of UAVs is subject to high uncertainty, necessitating autonomous
   recovery systems. This article develops a multiagent deep reinforcement
   learning-based management scheme for reliable industry surveillance in

Abstract = {Spam has been infesting our emails and Web experience for decades;
   distributing phishing scams, adult/dating scams, rogue security
   software, ransomware, money laundering and banking scams... the list
   goes on. Fortunately, in the last few years, user awareness has
   increased and email spam filters have become more effective, catching
   over 99\% of spam. The downside is that spammers are constantly changing
   their techniques as well as looking for new target platforms and means
   of delivery, and as the world is going mobile so too are the spammers.
   Indeed, mobile messaging spam has become a real problem and is steadily
   increasing year-over-year. We have been analyzing SMS spam data from a
   large US carrier for over six months, and we have observed all these
   threats, and more, indiscriminately targeting large numbers of
   subscribers. In this paper, we touch on such questions as what is
   driving SMS spam, how do the spammers operate, what are their activity
   patterns and how have they evolved over time. We also discuss what types
   of challenges SMS spam has created in terms of filtering, as well as
   security.},

Title = {Effects of mobile Internet use on college student pedestrian injury risk},
Journal = {ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {51},
Pages = {78-83},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: College-age individuals have the highest incidence of
   pedestrian injuries of any age cohort. One factor that might contribute
   to elevated pedestrian injuries among this age group is injuries
   incurred while crossing streets distracted by mobile devices.
   Objectives: Examine whether young adult pedestrian safety is compromised
   while crossing a virtual pedestrian street while distracted using the
   Internet on a mobile ``smartphone.{''}
   Method: A within-subjects design was implemented with 92 young adults.
   Participants crossed a virtual pedestrian street 20 times, half the time
   while undistracted and half while completing an email-driven ``scavenger
   hunt{''} to answer mundane questions using mobile Internet on their cell
   phones. Six measures of pedestrian behavior were assessed during
   crossings. Participants also reported typical patterns of street
   crossing and mobile Internet use.
   Results: Participants reported using mobile Internet with great
   frequency in daily life, including while walking across streets. In the
   virtual street environment, pedestrian behavior was greatly altered and
   generally more risky when participants were distracted by Internet use.
   While distracted, participants waited longer to cross the street
   (F=42.37), missed more safe opportunities to cross (F=42.63), took
   longer to initiate crossing when a safe gap was available (F=53.03),
   looked left and right less often (F=124.68), spent more time looking
   away from the road (F=1959.78), and were more likely to be hit or almost
   hit by an oncoming vehicle (F=29.54; all ps<0.01). Results were retained
   after controlling for randomized order; participant gender, age, and
   ethnicity; and both pedestrian habits and mobile Internet experience.
   Conclusion: Pedestrian behavior was influenced, and generally
   considerably riskier, when participants were simultaneously using mobile
   Internet and crossing the street than when crossing the street with no
   distraction. This finding reinforces the need for increased awareness
   concerning the risks of distracted pedestrian behavior. (C) 2012

Abstract = {In our everyday life, we communicate with many people such as family,
   friends, neighbors, and colleagues. We communicate with them using
   different communication media such as email, telephone calls, and
   face-to-face interactions. While email is not real-time and face-to-face
   communications require geographic proximity, voice and video
   communications are preferred over other modes of communication. However,
   real-time voice/video calls may create nuisance to the receiver. In this
   article, we describe a mathematical model for computing nuisance level
   of incoming voice/video calls. We computed the closeness and nuisance
   level using the calling patterns between the caller and the callee. To
   validate the nuisance model, we collected cell phone call records of
   real-life people at our university and computed the nuisance value for
   all voice calls. We validated the nuisance levels using the feedback
   from those real-life people. Such a nuisance model is useful for
   predicting unwanted voice and video sessions in an IP communication
   network.},

Abstract = {The traditional single-context recommendation algorithm is constrained
   by the sparse connection between users and items and a user/item cold
   start problem. Based on the review, the text-based cross-context
   recommendation algorithm extracts user/item comment information in the
   auxiliary context to alleviate the target context's data sparsity
   problem and improve recommendation accuracy. A cross-context
   recommendation strategy based on self-attention-based federated learning
   (SAFL) is suggested in this work. In contrast to current algorithms,
   SAFL fully mixes the target and auxiliary background information.
   Federated learning addresses crucial challenges including data privacy,
   data security, data access rights, and access to heterogeneous data by
   allowing several players to develop a single, strong machine learning
   model without sharing data. To begin, self-attention mechanism is
   introduced to model the user's preference information; then, the
   information from one field is used to improve the recommendation
   accuracy of another area; and finally, the information from the two
   contexts is integrated into the knowledge fusion module and the score
   prediction module to predict the score. Experiments on the Amazon
   dataset indicate that MAE and MSE values of SAFL are higher when
   compared to the current cross-context recommendation model, MAE values
   rose by 8.4\%, 13.2\%, and 19.4\% across three cross-context datasets.},

Abstract = {Urban areas worldwide are implementing measures to mitigate the
   environmental and lifestyle impacts of extensive private car usage. This
   paper introduces a mobile platform designed to address these challenges
   by offering a flexible system for renting electric cars within urban
   settings, integrating shared mobility concepts with a strong
   user-centric approach.
   The platform serves as a central hub for managing electric vehicle
   rentals, with a streamlined registration process requiring only a phone
   number, email and license for user engagement. Beyond sustainability
   goals, the project prioritizes transparency and security by implementing
   a blockchain-based database, ensuring data integrity and financial
   security.
   This approach not only promotes sustainable mobility but also tackles
   key urban challenges such as traffic congestion and air pollution. By
   leveraging advanced technologies and focusing on user needs, the
   platform represents a significant step towards enhancing urban mobility
   while contributing to a cleaner and more efficient urban environment.},

Title = {Mitigating fraud in a fully decentralized clinical trial of a digital
   health intervention},
Journal = {ANNALS OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {59},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Background Decentralized clinical trials (DCT), digital survey
   methodologies, and health monitoring technologies create the potential
   to reduce study participant burden as well as enhance sample diversity
   and enrollment pace. However, fraudulent participant activity poses a
   significant threat to study validity and data integrity.Purpose This
   study quantifies fraudulent attempts at participation in a DCT of a
   mobile mental health intervention for problematic substance use and
   discusses methods to prevent and detect fraudulent activity.Methods
   Adults residing in the US reporting problematic substance use were
   recruited for a fully remote DCT via 2 primary channels: social media
   advertisements and survey panels. The DCT offered incentives totaling up
   to \$100 for completing assessments over the 12-week study. To prevent
   and detect fraudulent activity, the research team utilized VPN and proxy
   detection, checked for duplicate identifiers (e.g., emails, phone
   numbers, IP Addresses), and compared age and date of birth (DOB)
   responses across timepoints. Descriptive statistics and group
   comparisons across the 2 sources of recruitment methodology were
   utilized to quantify and characterize fraudulent activity.Results Of the
   2,781 eligible screeners completed, 1,725 (62\%) were determined to be
   fraudulent prior to randomization, detected most commonly by duplicate
   identifiers (65\%) and/or VPN and proxy detection (47\%). Of the 258
   randomized participants, 51 (20\%) were later determined to be
   fraudulent based upon age and/or DOB mismatch. Notable patterns in
   fraudulent activity (e.g., 42\% of fraudulent screening respondents
   reported the exact age of 30 years; stylistic formatting of email
   address accounts) were identified. The fraudulent recruitment rate was
   higher for social media advertising (85\%) than survey panels
   (26\%).Conclusions Both social media and survey panel recruitment
   resulted in high levels of fraudulent activity in a DCT of a mobile
   mental health intervention. Researchers conducting DCTs and/or online
   surveys are urged to take several precautions and preventative measures
   to insulate against fraudulent activity including embedding identity
   verification procedures in consent processes. Researchers should
   consider making personal contact with a participant to verify identity
   as well as remain vigilant for fraudulent activity and its real-time
   dynamic potential.Trial Registration NCT04925570.
   Fully remote decentralized trial, what's your fraud prevention plan?
   This study shares hard-earned lessons, metrics, and preventive
   strategies to help insulate against fraudulent enrollment efforts in
   research.
   Research that is done virtually (i.e., without face-to-face contact) can
   open up opportunities to participate. However, fully remote research
   runs the risk of attracting people who misrepresent themselves to gain
   research payments. The current study was conducted fully remotely and
   aimed to evaluate an 8-week mobile app for reducing substance use.
   People were recruited via social media and from online survey panels.
   The study offered up to \$100 for participation. Notably, the research
   team determined that over 60\% of people seeking to join the study were
   not legitimate. To detect fraud, the research team used tools to
   identify masked or encrypted internet activity, checked for duplicated
   emails and phone numbers, and looked for discrepancy in reported age and
   birthdate. Even after participants were enrolled, another 1 in 5 were
   later identified as fraudulent. Fraud was especially problematic via
   social media recruitment channels. The findings highlight the need for
   stronger safeguards in online research, such as verifying identities
   during consent and maintaining real-time monitoring throughout the
   study.},

Abstract = {Storing the Personal Health Records (PHR's) manually in database takes
   lot of time and is also not secure. Due to massive growth of health
   domain makes this process more tedious. In this paper, a method is
   proposed where the information of the patient can be stored in the cloud
   environment. User files are automatically placed in the public \&
   private cloud based on the sensitiveness of the data. Normal files are
   placed in the public cloud, where as critical data is placed in the
   private cloud. The data is stored in multiple servers for fast data
   retrieval by using Attribute Based Encryption (ABE). When user's access
   is manipulated, the intimation is given to the authorized users through
   the web page for security based data access. OTP (One Time Password) is
   generated by the help of Keyword Based Key Generation to the authorized
   users via email for security based data access to cross the attribute of
   user privilege to deploy cross privilege access via android mobile. With
   proposed method security level is increased and the trust worthiness is
   also maintained.},

Abstract = {Cloud-based data storage service has drawn increasing interests from
   both academic and industry in the recent years due to its efficient and
   low cost management. Since it provides services in an open network, it
   is urgent for service providers to make use of secure data storage and
   sharing mechanism to ensure data confidentiality and service user
   privacy. To protect sensitive data from being compromised, the most
   widely used method is encryption. However, simply encrypting data (e.g.,
   via AES) cannot fully address the practical need of data management.
   Besides, an effective access control over download request also needs to
   be considered so that Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDoS) attacks
   cannot be launched to hinder users from enjoying service. In this
   article, we consider the dual access control, in the context of
   cloud-based storage, in the sense that we design a control mechanism
   over both data access and download request without loss of security and
   efficiency. Two dual access control systems are designed in this
   article, where each of them is for a distinct designed setting. The
   security and experimental analysis for the systems are also presented.},

Abstract = {Moodle is one of the most popular open source e-learning platforms. It
   makes available a very easy-to-deploy environment, which once installed,
   is ready to be used. These two characteristics, make it a very
   attractive choice. But regarding information security and privacy, it
   presents several and important drawbacks. This is mainly due to the fact
   that it leaves the most serious tasks, like server configuration or
   access control in the hands of the system administrator or third-party
   module developers. This approach is understandable, as is that very fact
   what makes Moodle easy and therefore attractive. The aim of this paper
   is not to discredit this option, but to enhance it by means of standard
   cryptographic and information security infrastructures. We focus in the
   registration process, which ends with the distribution of a user
   certificate. To link the users' real identity with their virtual one, we
   have taken an approach that merges EBIAS (Email Based Identification and
   Authentication System) with a kind of challenge-response method
   involving secure pseudo random number generation based in a fast
   chaos-based Pseudo Random Number Generator.},

Title = {Creative Persuasion: A Study on Adversarial Behaviors and Strategies in
   Phishing Attacks},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 21},
Abstract = {Success of phishing attacks depend on effective exploitation of human
   weaknesses. This research explores a largely ignored, but crucial aspect
   of phishing: the adversarial behavior. We aim at understanding human
   behaviors and strategies that adversaries use, and how these may
   determine the end-user response to phishing emails. We accomplish this
   through a novel experiment paradigm involving two phases. In the
   adversarial phase, 105 participants played the role of a phishing
   adversary who were incentivized to produce multiple phishing emails that
   would evade detection and persuade end-users to respond. In the end-user
   phase, 340 participants performed an email management task, where they
   examined and classified phishing emails generated by participants in
   phase-one along with benign emails. Participants in the adversary role,
   self-reported the strategies they employed in each email they created,
   and responded to a test of individual creativity. Data from both phases
   of the study was combined and analyzed, to measure the effect of
   adversarial behaviors on end-user response to phishing emails. We found
   that participants who persistently used specific attack strategies
   (e.g., sending notifications, use of authoritative tone, or expressing
   shared interest) in all their attempts were overall more successful,
   compared to others who explored different strategies in each attempt. We
   also found that strategies largely determined whether an end-user was
   more likely to respond to an email immediately, or delete it. Individual
   creativity was not a reliable predictor of adversarial performance, but
   it was a predictor of an adversary's ability to evade detection. In
   summary, the phishing example provided initially, the strategies used,
   and the participants' persistence with some of the strategies led to
   higher performance in persuading end-users to respond to phishing
   emails. These insights may be used to inform tools and training
   procedures to detect phishing strategies in emails.},

Abstract = {As urbanization expands rapidly, traffic accidents have become one of
   the greatest environmental scourges, leading to the loss of life,
   economic loss, and public safety. A real-time accident detection and
   response mechanism is proposed that utilizes the ResNet deep learning
   algorithm to automatically identify and classify accidents based on the
   severity based on streaming camera feed. ResNet is so capable of feature
   extraction that accidents are classified with almost-absolute accuracy:
   minor or major ones. In the case of a major accident, messages are sent
   automatically to the police and the nearest hospitals, with the reminder
   email being sent if action is not taken within seconds, ensuring a
   relatively swift response. In the case of minor accidents, reports are
   made to the police immediately. Furthermore for future work our system
   will have an integrated human detection module based on SSD-MobileNet
   counts the bystanders at the accident scene and provides valuable
   information on public response. The proposed approach uses one of the
   most contemporary deep learning algorithms to improve detection
   classification and to ensure a completely automated alert system that
   enables timely and coordinated emergency response, reducing response
   time and contributing towards safer roads.},

Title = {Feasibility and Acceptability of a Mobile Technology Intervention to
   Support Postabortion Care in British Columbia: Phase I},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},

Month = {MAY 29},
Abstract = {Background: Over 30\% of women in Canada undergo an abortion. Despite
   the prevalence of the procedure, stigma surrounding abortion in Canada
   leads to barriers for women to access this service. The vast majority of
   care is concentrated in urban settings. There is evidence to support
   utilization of innovative mobile and other technology solutions to
   empower women to safely and effectively self-manage aspects of the
   abortion process. This study is part 1 of a 3-phase study that utilizes
   user-centered design methodology to develop a digital health solution to
   specifically support follow-up after an induced surgical abortion.
   Objective: This study aimed to (1) understand how women at 3 surgical
   abortion clinics in an urban center of British Columbia utilize their
   mobile phones to access health care information and (2) understand
   women's preferences of content and design of an intervention that will
   support follow-up care after an induced abortion, including
   contraceptive use.
   Methods: The study design was based on
   development-evaluation-implementation process from Medical Research
   Council Framework for Complex Medical Interventions. This was a
   mixed-methods formative study. Women (aged 14-45 years) were recruited
   from 3 urban abortion facilities in British Columbia who underwent an
   induced abortion. Adaptation of validated surveys and using the
   technology acceptance model and theory of reasoned action, a
   cross-sectional survey was designed. Interview topics included
   demographic information; type of wireless device used; cell phone usage;
   acceptable information to include in a mobile intervention to support
   women's abortion care; willingness to use a mobile phone to obtain
   reproductive health information; optimal strategies to use a mobile
   intervention to support women; understand preferences for health
   information resources; and design qualities in a mobile intervention
   important for ease of use, privacy, and security. Responses to questions
   in the survey were summarized using descriptive statistics. Qualitative
   analysis was conducted with NVivo using a thematic analysis approach.
   This study was approved by the local ethics board.
   Results: A waiting-room survey was completed by 50 participants, and
   semistructured interviews were completed with 8 participants. The
   average age of participants was 26 years. Furthermore, 94\% (47/50)
   owned a smartphone, 85\% (41/48) used their personal phones to go
   online, and 85\% would use their cell phone to assist in clinical care.
   Qualitative analysis demonstrated that women prefer a comprehensive
   website that included secure email or text notifications to provide
   tools and resources for emotional well-being, contraceptive decision
   making, general sexual health, and postprocedure care.
   Conclusions: A community-based mixed-methods approach allowed us to
   understand how women use their cell phones and what women desire in a
   mobile intervention to support their postabortion care. The findings
   from this formative phase will assist in the development and testing of
   a mobile intervention to support follow-up care after an induced
   surgical abortion.},

Abstract = {In some e-learning and blended-learning institutions, such as the Saudi
   Electronic University (SEU) in Saudi Arabia, prior to the students
   undertaking exams, the exam questions are distributed to and shared
   among faculty members. This is done by email which poses a high security
   risk. Hence, using email for the exchange of confidential files such as
   exams in learning institutions can cause the issues of latency, human
   error, and related security concerns. Therefore, this paper presents a
   system to secure the digital content of exam questions and their
   transmission in e-learning institutions, enabling the control of access
   to content with suitable management features for security, auditing, and
   archiving using leading technology solutions for content management and
   security. The results of our simulation showed that the proposed system
   provides a faster and more secure access to and exchange of exams
   between the instructors and the college and the campus supervisor.
   Moreover, our system reduces the likelihood that there will be errors in
   exams and subsequent delay.},

Abstract = {Automated email-based password reestablishment (EBPR) is an efficient,
   cost-effective means to deal with forgotten passwords. In this
   technique, email providers authenticate users on behalf of web sites.
   This method works because web sites trust email providers to deliver
   messages to their intended recipients. Simple Authentication for the Web
   (SAW) improves upon this basic approach to user authentication to create
   an alternative to password-based logins. SAW: 1) Removes the setup and
   management costs of passwords at EBPR-enabled sites; 2) Provides single
   sign-on without a specialized identity provider; 3) Thwarts passive
   attacks and raises the bar for active attacks; 4) Enables easy, secure
   sharing and collaboration without passwords; 5) Provides intuitive
   delegation and revocation of authority; and 6) Facilitates client-side

Abstract = {In the cyber world, insider threats significantly challenge
   organizational security. These threats originate from malicious or
   negligent employees with authorized access, making them difficult to
   detect using traditional security measures such as access control

   exploring existing approaches and the spectrum of detection methods and
   techniques. We elaborate on different aspects concerning the insider,
   including their threats, activities, and motivations. We explore current
   detection approaches like user activity monitoring and behavior
   analytics. Analyzing network traffic logs, email communications, and
   access control records offers unique insights into user behavior,
   allowing for the identification of potential threats. We explore anomaly
   detection, signature-based detection, and user behavior analytics with
   machine learning algorithms. This review provides valuable insights for
   researchers in the insider threat detection field. It sheds light on the
   evolving landscape of insider threats and equips readers with the
   knowledge to develop effective detection strategies.},

Abstract = {As the world is realizing the power and efficiency of cloud computing,
   enhanced security and intelligence is needed in communication to filter
   out unethical data violating norms in clouds. No filtering
   categorization has been currently proposed. Numerous lists of banned,
   unethical and objectionable words have been developed with limited user
   satisfaction. Lists are usually manually generated, with some
   programmable extensibility for online forums and public newsgroups. We
   define a tool and methodology to categorize the censor data. We
   statistically grow words in the categorized data and tag the hidden
   neutral words with meaning in context. Using Computational Linguistics
   tools and modifying them to suit our means, we analyze sample text from
   gigabytes of email newsgroup dataset over Cloud Servers. A sample result
   dataset of the most frequently used words breaking the norms in recent
   cloud communication is presented in the results in broad categories. The
   categories separate cloud-server data found in newsgroups related to
   internet crimes, fraud, theft, anti-state elements, and other material
   of legal importance. Thus this study demonstrates a tag cloud of most
   frequent critical words in communications from legal and ethical
   point-of-view in the current scenario of cloud databases.},

   simulation},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {131},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Social engineering cyber-attacks such as phishing emails pose a serious
   threat to the safety of many organizations. Given that the effectiveness
   of these attacks heavily relies on poor human decision making, an
   improved understanding of the individual characteristics that increase
   cybersecurity vulnerability could inform more targeted training. The
   current study aimed to identify whether several factors, including
   phishing email detection ability, confidence in one's phishing
   identification decisions, general attitudes towards one's level of
   responsibility and efficacy, and employee satisfaction and loyalty to
   the organization, may predict behavior in a naturalistic phishing
   simulation in an employment setting. We followed up employees of a large
   organization who had been recently targeted by a phishing simulation and
   asked them to complete a survey that included a phishing detection task.
   The employees' behavior in the phishing simulation was ranked according
   to its safety: reporting the suspicious email, neither reporting nor
   clicking on the embedded link, and clicking on the link. We found that
   fewer years of employment at the organization and lower employee
   satisfaction and loyalty predicted increasingly unsafe behavior in the
   simulation. This suggests that newer and unsatisfied employees are most
   vulnerable to phishing attempts and might benefit most from targeted
   cybersecurity training. \& COPY; 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {With the everyday increasing importance of privacy, security, and wise
   use of computational resources, the corresponding technologies are
   increasingly being faced with the problem of file type detection. In
   digital forensic, there are numerous file formats in use. Criminals have
   started using either non-standard file formats or changing extensions of
   files while storing or transmitting them over a network. This makes
   recovering data out of these files difficult. An extension to the file
   name with the file type is stored in the disk directory, but when a file
   is deleted, the entry for the file in the directory may be overwritten
   and hence quite difficult to identify its type which is serious issue in
   computer forensics. But if the fragment of file has its header
   information containing type identifying information the mentioned
   problem may be solved. But it is difficult to identify the type of
   fragment from the middle or if the header information is deleted or
   unavailable the identification becomes more complex. This paper focuses
   on identifying the file types addressing the various scenarios of file
   type being changed by the malicious user to send some confidential or
   sensitive information by changing the file type (say.exe banned by Gmail
   can be converted to any acceptable format and sent across). E-mail spam
   has become an epidemic problem that can negatively affect the usability
   of electronic mail as a communication means. Besides wasting users' time
   and effort to scan and delete the massive amount of junk e-mails
   received, it consumes network bandwidth and storage space, slows down
   e-mail servers, and provides a medium to distribute harmful and/or
   offensive content. Inspired by the success of fuzzy similarity in text
   classification and document retrieval, the approach investigates its
   effectiveness in filtering spam based on the textual content of e-mail
   messages.},

   providers, ranging from email service providers and social networks to
   financial institutions and online marketplaces. Attackers have not been
   slow to capitalize on the vulnerabilities of this mechanism by using
   social engineering techniques to coerce users to forward authentication
   codes. We demonstrate one social engineering attack for which we
   experimentally obtained a 50\% success rate against Google's SMS-based
   authentication. At the heart of the problem is the messaging associated
   with the authentication code, and how this must not have been developed
   with security against social engineering in mind. Pursuing a top-down
   methodology, we generate alternative messages and experimentally test
   these against an array of social engineering attempts. Our most robust
   messaging approach reduces the success of the most effective social
   engineering attack to 8\%, or a sixth of its success against Google's
   standard second factor verification code messages. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   cost, functionality, and usability. We apply the model to examples about
   the adoption of encryption in communication (email and messaging) and
   storage technologies (self-encrypting drives) and also consider our
   model's predictions for the evolution of technology adoption over time.},

Title = {Protocol for a randomised placebo-controlled trial investigating the
   efficacy and safety of a vitamin-mineral formula targeting dysregulated
   emotions in teenagers: The balancing emotions of adolescents with
   micronutrients (BEAM) study},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Emotional dysregulation (ED) is a significant contributing
   factor to psychological distress in young people. ED is a
   transdiagnostic dimension characterized by an excessive reactivity to
   negative emotional stimuli with affective (anger) and behavioral
   (aggression) components, and is present across anxiety, mood and
   behavioral disorders. Due to early onset, high prevalence and
   persistence, ED in childhood is one of the most psychosocially impairing
   and cost-intensive mental health conditions, with not enough children
   improving with conventional treatments. Clinical trials have established
   preliminary efficacy of micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) in the
   treatment of ED. This project expands the research to examine
   micronutrient efficacy for teenagers with ED.Methods: This study is the
   first double-blind (participant and investigators) 8 week randomized
   controlled trial (with 8 week open-label extension and one year
   follow-up) designed to explore the efficacy and safety of micronutrients
   compared with placebo in 150 medication-free emotionally dysregulated
   youth (12-17 years), referred via self-referral, delivered remotely
   throughout New Zealand, using a website for monitoring symptoms, with a
   psychologist available online via text, email and video for assessment
   and monitoring. The primary outcome measures will be the Clinical Global
   Impression (CGI-I), the reactivity subscale of the Emotion
   Dysre-gulation Inventory (EDI) and the Clinician Rated Temper and
   Irritability Scale (CL-ARI).Discussion: Micronutrient intervention
   delivered alongside online assessment and monitoring has the potential
   to transform delivery of mental health care to young people who may not
   be willing or able to access traditional therapies. We also hope that
   this intervention shows acceptability across different ethnicities.},

Title = {CloudDLP: Transparent and Scalable Data Sanitization for Browser-Based
   Cloud Storage},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {68449-68459},
Abstract = {Browser-based cloud storage services are still broadly used in
   enterprises for online sharing and collaboration. However, sensitive
   information in images or documents may be easily leaked outside trusted
   enterprise on-premises due to such cloud services. Existing solutions to
   prevent data leakage in cloud storage services either limit many
   functionalities of cloud applications or are difficult to be scaled to
   various cloud applications. In this paper, we propose CloudDLP, a
   transparent and scalable approach for enterprises to automatically
   sanitize sensitive data in images and documents with various
   browser-based cloud applications. CloudDLP is deployed as an internet
   gateway within the premises of an enterprise using JavaScript injecting
   techniques and deep learning methods to sanitize sensitive premise data.
   It neither compromises the user experience nor significantly affects
   application functionalities in browser-based cloud storage services. We
   have evaluated CloudDLP with a number of real-world cloud applications.
   Our experimental results show that it can achieve automatic data
   sanitization with cloud storage services while preserving most
   functionalities of cloud applications.},

Abstract = {Phishing continues to be a problem for both individuals and
   organisations, with billions of dollars lost every year. We propose the
   use of nudges - more specifically social saliency nudges - that aim to
   highlight important information to the user when evaluating emails. We
   used Signal Detection Theory to assess the effects of both sender
   saliency (highlighting important fields from the sender) and receiver
   saliency (showing numbers of other users in receipt of the same email).
   Sender saliency improved phish detection but did not introduce any
   unwanted response bias. Users were asked to rate their confidence in
   their own judgements and these confidence scores were poorly calibrated
   with actual performance, particularly for phishing (as opposed to
   genuine) emails. We also examined the role of impulsive behaviour on
   phish detection, concluding that those who score highly on dysfunctional
   impulsivity are less likely to detect the presence of phishing emails.},

Title = {Integrating cancer survivors' experiences into UK cancer registries:
   design and development of the ePOCS system (electronic Patient-reported
   Outcomes from Cancer Survivors)},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding the psychosocial challenges of cancer
   survivorship, and identifying which patients experience ongoing
   difficulties, is a key priority. The ePOCS (electronic patient-reported
   outcomes from cancer survivors) project aims to develop and evaluate a
   cost-efficient, UK-scalable electronic system for collecting
   patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), at regular post-diagnostic
   timepoints, and linking these with clinical data in cancer registries.
   METHODS: A multidisciplinary team developed the system using agile
   methods. Design entailed process mapping the system's constituent parts,
   data flows and involved human activities, and undertaking usability
   testing. Informatics specialists built new technical components,
   including a web-based questionnaire tool and tracking database, and
   established component-connecting data flows. Development challenges were
   overcome, including patient usability and data linkage and security.
   RESULTS: We have developed a system in which PROMs are completed online,
   using a secure questionnaire administration tool, accessed via a
   public-facing website, and the responses are linked and stored with
   clinical registry data. Patient monitoring and communications are
   semiautomated via a tracker database, and patient correspondence is
   primarily Email-based. The system is currently honed for clinician-led
   hospital-based patient recruitment.
   CONCLUSIONS: A feasibility test study is underway. Although there are
   possible challenges to sustaining and scaling up ePOCS, the system has
   potential to support UK epidemiological PROMs collection and clinical
   data linkage. British Journal of Cancer (2011) 105, S74 - S81; doi:

Title = {Safety of Monkeypox Vaccine Using Active Surveillance, Two-Center
   Observational Study in Italy},
Journal = {VACCINES},

Abstract = {In August 2022, Italy launched a vaccination campaign to combat the
   spread of the monkeypox virus, which the WHO has designated as a public
   health emergency. Priority targets for the campaign included laboratory
   personnel and men who have sex with men with specific risk criteria.
   Primary immunization involved two doses of the Imvanex/Jynneos vaccine,
   followed by a single booster dose. We conducted a study in two Italian
   towns, Bologna and Forl ì, in October and November 2022 to investigate
   adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) of the monkeypox vaccine
   through participant-based active surveillance. Participants who received
   the vaccine and were aged 18 and over were invited to complete an
   e-questionnaire by scanning a QR code during their second vaccine
   appointment or by email one month after the booster dose. A descriptive
   analysis of AEFI incidences was conducted, with the results stratified
   by type and severity of symptoms. A total of 135 first-dose, 50
   second-dose, and 6 single-dose recipients were included, with a mean age
   of 36.4 \& PLUSMN; 8.7 years. Systemic reactions after the first and
   second doses were reported by 39.3\% and 26.0\% of participants,
   respectively, with asthenia being the most common symptom. Local site
   reactions were reported by 97.0\% and 100.0\% of participants,
   respectively, with redness, swelling, and itching being the most common
   local AEFIs. Grade 3 or 4 AEFIs were reported for local AEFIs only by
   16.8\% and 14.0\% of participants after the first and second doses,
   respectively. Our findings suggest that the monkeypox vaccine has a high
   tolerability profile in terms of short-term common systemic AEFIs.
   However, the high incidence and severity of local AEFIs highlight the
   need to monitor their persistence following intradermal administration
   of the vaccine.},

Abstract = {CyberCIEGE is a sophisticated network security simulation packaged as a
   video game and used by educators around the world to enhance information
   assurance education and training at universities, community colleges,
   within the DoD, and in other government agencies. The CyberCIEGE game
   engine was recently expanded to include Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
   features including certification authorities, selection of installed
   roots and cross certification. CyberCIEGE Virtual Private Network (VPN)
   gateways, VPN clients and email clients were then extended to
   incorporate the new PKI features. CyberCIEGE PKI abstractions are
   described in terms of player configuration choices and the consequences
   of these choices on network management and vulnerabilities. The
   CyberCIEGE game engine modifications include modeling of chains of trust
   and risks of cross certification schemes. The benefits of these
   enhancements include coherent integration of identity management
   technologies, ranging from the human interface through to the supporting
   distributed infrastructure, into scenarios. Benefits also include
   support for recent new scenarios focused on the PKI infrastructure,
   identity management, or both; and the ability to tie both identity
   management and PKI to concepts of identification, authentication,
   provenance, and access control.},

Abstract = {Identity-based public key encryption facilitates easy introduction of
   public key cryptography by allowing an entity's public key to be derived
   from an arbitrary identification value, such as name or email address.
   The main practical benefit of identity-based cryptography is in greatly
   reducing the need for, and reliance on, public key certificates.
   Although some interesting identity-based techniques have been developed
   in the past, none are compatible with popular public key encryption
   algorithms (such as El Gamal and RSA). This limits the utility of
   identity-based cryptography as a transitional step to full-blown public
   key cryptography. Furthermore, it is fundamentally difficult to
   reconcile fine-grained revocation with identity-based cryptography.
   Mediated RSA (mRSA) {[}9] is a simple and practical method of splitting
   a RSA private key between the user and a Security Mediator (SEM).
   Neither the user nor the SEM can cheat one another since each
   cryptographic operation (signature or decryption) involves both parties.
   mRSA allows fast and fine-grained control of users' security privileges.
   However, mRSA still relies on conventional public key certificates to
   store and communicate public keys. In this paper, we present IB-mRSA, a
   simple variant of mRSA that combines identity-based and mediated
   cryptography. Under the random oracle model, IB-mRSA with OAEP {[}7] is
   shown as secure (against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack) as standard
   RSA with OAEP. Furthermore, IB-mRSA is simple, practical, and compatible
   with current public key infrastructures.},

   Compression Side Channel Attacks Against HTTPS},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {86069-86082},
Abstract = {Web servers typically use data compression and encryption to optimize
   data transmission and protect user privacy. However, compression can
   inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities to compression side channel
   attacks (CSCA), which exploit the relationship between data redundancy
   and compression size to infer sensitive information. In this paper, we
   introduce Prexion, a novel compression system designed to counter CSCA
   while maintaining high compression efficiency. Prexion leverages a
   probabilistic mechanism to selectively include or exclude overlapping
   sequences in web page data during compression, making it difficult for
   attackers to exploit patterns in compressed sizes. This approach
   preserves the benefits of compression without compromising security.
   Through extensive experiments with real-world web pages, Prexion
   demonstrates superior performance, achieving up to 4.9 times better
   compression ratios than the current state-of-the-art solution, Debreach,
   for web pages with significant amounts of sensitive data. Furthermore,
   Prexion ensures robust security, with attack success rates consistently
   below 5\% under recommended configurations.},

Abstract = {Food security and sustainability is a major concern for Singapore due to
   its rapid urbanization, land scarcity, and low local food productions of
   fish and leafy vegetables. This paper attempts to design and develop a
   smart aquaponics system that can synergize fish farming and plant
   growing. Various sensors, actuators, microcontroller, and microprocessor
   were employed in the system to monitor and control water quality, light
   intensity, and fish feed. To ensure healthy growing environment for fish
   and plant, early warnings in form of email, short message service, and
   push notification are automatically sent to the user when the sensor
   detects any abnormal condition. Concurrently, the respective actuator
   will intervene and rectify the abnormal condition without human
   interference. Moreover, fish feed is dispensed at the user preset
   timings of the day. All system activities and live sensor measurements
   are securely stored in a cloud storage for data analysis. User-friendly
   web and mobile applications were also created to provide graphical user
   interfaces between the aquaponics system and the user. Additionally, the
   user can monitor the aquaponics facilities live from web application
   through a camera module of the system. As such, the proposed smart
   aquaponics system has demonstrated to be a self-sustainable,
   cost-effective, and eco-friendly urban farming that can attract
   commercial farmers and home gardeners. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published

Abstract = {Spammers have created a new kind of electronic mail (e-mail) called
   image-based spam to bypass text-based spam filters. Unfortunately, these
   images contain harmful links that can infect the user's computer system
   and take a long time to be deleted, which can hamper users' productivity
   and security. In this paper, a hybrid deep neural network architecture
   is suggested to address this problem. It is based on the convolution
   neural network (CNN), which has been enhanced with the convolutional
   block attention module (CBAM). Initially, CNN enhanced with CBAM is used
   to extract the most crucial information from each image-based e-mail.
   Then, the generated feature vectors are fed to the support vector
   machine (SVM) model to classify them as either spam or ham. Four
   datasets-including Image Spam Hunter (ISH), Annadatha, Chavda Approach
   1, and Chavda Approach 2-are used in the experiments. The obtained
   results demonstrated that in terms of accuracy, our model exceeds the
   existing state-of-the-art methods.},

Abstract = {Currently, the greatest risks for information security of organizations
   are internal, rather than external, threats. Data loss prevention (DLP)
   systems are used for minimization of risks related to internal threats.
   The main function of the DLP systems is to prevent leak of confidential
   data; however, comparison of the DLP systems relies currently on their
   capabilities to analyze information captured and convenience of carrying
   out retrospective investigations of information security incident. In
   the paper, a new approach to retrospective analysis of user's text
   information is presented. The idea of the proposed approach consists in
   topic analysis of the text content processed by the user in the past and
   prediction of further user behavior with content. User text content can
   cover different categories, including confidential ones. The topic
   analysis of user text content assumes determination of main topics and
   their weights for given past time intervals. Based on deviations of
   behavior of user's operations with a content from the forecast, one can
   reveal time intervals when operation with documents of one or another
   category differs from normal (historical) work and when the user worked
   with documents of unusual categories. The proposed approach was
   experimentally verified on an example of actual corporate email
   correspondence created from the Enron data set.},

Abstract = {Public-key cryptosystems without requiring digital certificates are very
   attractive in wireless communications due to limitations imposed by
   Communication bandwidth and computational resource of the mobile
   wireless communication devices. To eliminate public-key digital
   certificate, Shamir introduced the concept of the identity-based
   (ID-based) cryptosystem. The main advantage of the ID-based cryptosystem
   is that instead of using a random integer as each user's public key as
   in the traditional public-key systems, the user's real identity, such as
   user's name or email address, becomes the user's public key. However,
   all identity-based signature (IBS) schemes have the inherent key escrow
   problem, that is private key generator (PKG) knows the private key of
   each user. As a result, the PKG is able to sign any message on the
   users' behalf This nature violates the ``non-repudiation{''} requirement
   of digital signatures. To solve the key escrow problem of the IBS while
   still taking advantage of the benefits of the IBS, certificateless
   digital signature (CDS) was introduced. In this paper, we propose a
   generalized approach to construct CDS schemes. In our proposed CDS
   scheme, the user's private key is known only to the user himself,
   therefore, it can eliminate the key escrow problem from the PKG. The
   proposed construction can be applied to all Discrete Logarithm
   (DL)-based signature schemes to convert a digital signature scheme into
   a CDS scheme. The proposed CDS scheme is secure against adaptive
   chosen-message attack in the random oracle model. In addition, it is
   also efficient in signature generation and verification. (C) 2008

Abstract = {Mobile code refers to programs that come into a host computer over the
   network and start to execute with or without a user's knowledge or
   consent. Because these programs run in the execution context of the user
   that downloads them, they can issue any system calls that the user is
   allowed to make, and thus pose a serious security threat when they are
   malicious. Although many solutions have been proposed to solve the
   malicious mobile code problem, none of them are truly effective at
   striking a good balance between defeating zero-day attacks and
   minimizing disruption to the execution of legitimate applications.
   This paper describes a commercial system called SEES that secures the
   execution of mobile code that comes into a host computer as an email
   attachment or as a web document downloaded through an anchor link by
   running them on a separate guinea pig machine rather than on the user
   machine. Effectively, it takes an isolation approach to the secure
   mobile code execution problem. As a result, SEES guarantees that no
   malicious email attachments or web documents that act on behalf of the
   user that downloads them, can damage the resources of the user machine,
   or can leak any confidential information. In particular, even zero-day
   virus cannot cause any harms. We present the design, implementation and
   evaluation of SEES on the Windows platform, and contrast it with other
   existing approaches to the same problem.},

Abstract = {Rationale Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many hospitals
   have reduced in-hospital visitation. In these situations, virtual
   communication tools have helped maintain interaction between parties.
   The Frontline Connect program was designed to address communication and
   patient care challenges by providing data-enabled devices to clinical
   staff in hospitals. Objective This study aimed to identify areas of
   improvement for the Frontline Connect program by: (a) evaluating
   communication needs, user experience, and program satisfaction; and (b)
   identifying potential barriers to device access or use. Methods We
   administered pre-implementation needs assessment, post-use, and exit
   surveys to healthcare staff at a pilot hospital site in Ontario.
   Recruitment was through email lists and site champions using convenience
   sampling. We descriptively analysed survey responses and compared the
   initial need statements to post-implementation use-cases identified by
   users. Results We received 139 needs assessments, 31 user experience
   assessments, and 47 exit survey responses. Most device use occurred in
   the emergency department and intensive care units and was facilitated by
   social workers, nurses, and physicians to connect patients, families,
   and care providers. Pre-implementation concerns were related to
   infection control, data security, and device privacy. In the exit
   survey, these were replaced by other concerns including Internet
   connectivity and time-intensiveness. Device utility and ease-of-use were
   rated 9.7/10 and 9.6/10 respectively in the user experience survey,
   though overall experience was rated 7.2/10 in the exit survey. Overall,
   respondents viewed the devices as useful and we agree with participants
   who suggested increased program promotion and training would likely
   improve adoption. Conclusions We found that our virtual technology
   program for facilitating communication was positively perceived. Survey
   feedback indicates that a rapid rollout in response to urgent
   pandemic-related needs was feasible, though program logistics could be
   improved. The current work supports the need to improve, standardize,
   and sustain virtual communication programs in hospitals.},

Abstract = {Prior to the introduction of guard systems for electronic mail, guards
   tended to be overly specialized and not versatile enough for today's
   user community. This paper examines the use of Type Enforcement to
   create a highly assured yet administrator configurable guard. The
   administrator must be able to trust that the configuration provided will
   indeed be followed. This occurs by using highly assured or trusted
   components. These trusted components are then linked together via Type
   Enforcement to form a pipeline, with one input channel for data to enter
   the guard, and one separate, connected output channel for data to exit
   the guard. These channels are connected via assured processes whose
   behavior is restricted by the Type Enforcement mechanism. Furthermore,
   Type Enforcement is also used to isolate many components of the guard,
   which simplifies the assurance arguments. This technology is applied in
   the latest operational guards developed by Secure Computing Corporation.},

Abstract = {Decentralized Applications (DApps) have garnered significant attention
   due to their decentralization, anonymity, and data autonomy. However,
   these systems face potential privacy challenge. The privacy challenge
   arises from the necessity for external service providers to collect and
   process user interaction data. The untrustworthiness of these providers
   may lead to privacy breaches, compromising the overall security of such
   DApp environments. To address this challenge, we model the interaction
   data in the DApp environments as dynamic graphs and propose a dynamic
   graph publication method named HMG (Hidden Markov Model for Dynamic
   Graphs). HMG estimates the interaction probabilities between users by
   extracting the temporal information from historically collected data and
   constructs an optimized model to generate synthetic graphs. The
   synthetic graphs can preserve the dynamic topological characteristics of
   the interaction processes within DApp environments while effectively
   protecting user privacy, thus assisting external service providers in
   performing effective analyses. Finally, we evaluate the performance of
   HMG using real-world datasets and benchmark it against commonly used
   graph metrics. The results demonstrate that the synthetic graphs
   preserve essential features, making them suitable for analysis by
   service providers.},

Abstract = {Phishing is a fraudulent form of email that solicits personal or
   financial information from the recipient, such as a password, username,
   or social security or bank account number. The scammer may use the
   illicitly obtained information to steal the victim's money or identity
   or sell the information to another party. The direct costs of phishing
   on consumers are exceptionally high and have risen substantially over
   the past 12 years. Phishing experiments that simulate real world
   conditions can provide cybersecurity experts with valuable knowledge
   they can use to develop effective countermeasures and prevent people
   from being duped by phishing emails. Although these experiments
   contravene widely accepted informed consent requirements and involve
   deception, we argue that they can be conducted ethically if risks are
   minimized, confidentiality and privacy are protected, potential
   participants have an opportunity to opt out of the research before it
   begins, and human subjects are debriefed after their participation ends.},

Abstract = {We present an efficient and non-interactive method for Text
   Classification while preserving the privacy of the content using Fully
   Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). Our solution (named Private Fast Text
   (PrivFT)) provides two services: 1) making inference of encrypted user
   inputs using a plaintext model and 2) training an effective model using
   an encrypted dataset. For inference, we use a pre-trained plaintext
   model and outline a system for homomorphic inference on encrypted user
   inputs with zero loss to prediction accuracy compared to the
   non-encrypted version. In the second part, we show how to train a
   supervised model using fully encrypted data to generate an encrypted
   model. For improved performance, we provide a GPU implementation of the
   Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) FHE scheme that shows 1 to 2 orders of
   magnitude speedup against existing implementations. We build PrivFT on
   top of our FHE engine in GPUs to achieve a run time per inference of
   0.17 seconds for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) public
   datasets. Training on a relatively large encrypted dataset is more
   computationally intensive requiring 5.04 days.},

Title = {User perceptions of mental health consequences of hallucinogen use in

Abstract = {AIMS - The article aims to gain insight into the private worlds of users
   of hallucinogenic drugs in spiritual contexts, with a focus on the
   self-perceived mental health implications of their practices. This will
   help us understand the rationale behind and consequences of
   hallucinogenic drug use. METHOD - Respondents were recruited at several
   internet fora for individual email-mediated interviews (n = 5) or group
   interviews in public discussion threads (n = 11). They were
   predominantly males in their 30s or 40s with stable jobs and living
   conditions and extensive hallucinogen experience. RESULTS - Both
   positive and adverse consequences were assessed, and respondents
   emphasised the capacity of hallucinogenic drugs for healing and personal
   growth; even adverse experiences ({''}bad trips{''}) were regarded as
   valuable for these purposes. The dependence potential of these drugs was
   regarded as low because of an inherent self-regulatory mechanism whereby
   positive effects disappear with overuse. A minority of participants
   reported mental health problems that may result from their hallucinogen
   use, but the majority have experienced no significant adverse reactions
   after many years of use. This should be seen in light of the low
   frequency of their hallucinogen use. CONCLUSION - The study obtained
   evidence of a predominantly male group of mature users taking
   hallucinogens in carefully prepared sessions for the purpose of personal
   spiritual growth, acknowledging some risks but also several benefits
   from this practice.},

Abstract = {Web application attacks are an extreme threat to the world's information
   technology infrastructure. A web application is generally defined as a
   client-server software application where the client uses a user
   interface within a web browser. Most users are familiar with web
   application attacks. For instance, a user may have received a link in an
   email that led the user to a malicious website. The most widely accepted
   solution to this threat is to deploy an Intrusion Detection System
   (IDS). Such a system currently relies on signatures of the predefined
   set of events matching with attacks. Issues still arise as all possible
   attack signatures may not be defined before deploying an IDS. Attack
   events may not fit with the pre-defined signatures. Thus, there is a
   need to detect new types of attacks with a mutated signature based
   detection approach. Most traditional literature works describe signature
   based IDSs for application layer attacks, but several works mention that
   not all attacks can be detected. It is well known that many security
   threats can be related to software or application development and design
   or implementation flaws. Given that fact, this work expands a new method
   for signature based web application layer attack detection. We apply a
   genetic algorithm to analyze web server and database logs and the log
   entries. The work contributes to the development of a mutated signature
   detection framework. The initial results show that the suggested
   approach can detect specific application layer attacks such as
   Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Injection and Remote File Inclusion attacks.},

Abstract = {Introduction:Designing and conducting clinical trials is challenging for
   some institutions and researchers due to associated time and personnel
   requirements. We conducted recruitment, screening, informed consent,
   study product distribution, and data collection remotely. Our objective
   is to describe how to conduct a randomized clinical trial using remote
   and automated methods. Methods:A randomized clinical trial in healthcare
   workers is used as a model. A random group of workers were invited to
   participate in the study through email. Following an automated process,
   interested individuals scheduled consent/screening interviews. Enrollees
   received study product by mail and surveys via email. Adherence to study
   product and safety were monitored with survey data review and via
   real-time safety alerts to study staff. Results:A staff of 10 remotely
   screened 406 subjects and enrolled 299 over a 3-month period. Adherence
   to study product was 87\%, and survey data completeness was 98.5\% over
   9 months. Participants and study staff scored the System Usability Scale
   93.8\% and 90\%, respectively. The automated and remote methods allowed
   the study maintenance period to be managed by a small study team of two
   members, while safety monitoring was conducted by three to four team
   members. Conception of the trial to study completion was 21 months.
   Conclusions:The remote and automated methods produced efficient subject
   recruitment with excellent study product adherence and data
   completeness. These methods can improve efficiency without sacrificing
   safety or quality. We share our XML file for researchers to use as a
   template for learning purposes or designing their own clinical trials.},

Abstract = {Authentication is the first, crucial step in securing digital assets
   like cryptocurrencies and online services like banking. It relies on
   principals maintaining exclusive access to credentials like
   cryptographic signing keys, passwords, and physical devices. But both
   individuals and organizations struggle to manage their credentials,
   resulting in loss of assets and identity theft.
   In this work, we study mechanisms with back-and-forth interaction with
   the principals. For example, a user receives an email notification about
   sending money from her bank account and is given a period of time to
   abort.
   We define the authentication problem, where a mechanism interacts with a
   user and an attacker. A mechanism's success depends on the
   scenario-which credentials each principal knows. The profile of a
   mechanism is the set of scenarios in which it succeeds. The subset
   relation on profiles defines a partial order on mechanisms. We bound the
   profile size and discover three types of novel mechanisms that are
   maximally secure.
   We show the efficacy of our model by analyzing existing mechanisms and
   make concrete improvement proposals: Using ``sticky{''} messages for
   security notifications, prioritizing credentials when accessing one's
   bank account, and using one of our maximal mechanisms to improve a
   popular cryptocurrency wallet. We demonstrate the practicality of our
   mechanisms by implementing the latter.},

Abstract = {Ring Confidential Transactions (RingCT) is a typical privacy-preserving
   protocol for blockchain, which is used for the most popular anonymous
   cryptocurrency Monero in recent years. RingCT provides the user's
   identity anonymity based on the linkable ring signature. At the cost of
   that, the transaction size is increased linearly to the involved users.
   In this article, we aim to overcome this inefficient aspect of RingCT by
   introducing the linkable threshold ring signature (LTRS). We first
   propose a construction of threshold ring signatures for homomorphic
   cryptosystems, and present an efficient instantiation based on the
   intractability assumption of the discrete logarithm problem. Based on
   this framework, an efficient LTRS scheme and a novel construction of the
   RingCT protocol are presented. Our proposed RingCT protocol enables
   multiple payers to co-construct an anonymous transaction without
   revealing their secret account keys, and it is more concise under
   multiple input accounts. For a transaction with a ring size of 100 and
   the input accounts number of 64, the communication overhead is about 4\%
   of the original RingCT protocol.},

Abstract = {The growth of unsolicited email or junk mail has become a major threat
   to information security today. Most of the commercial websites providing
   email facility today provide some form of programmable automatic
   filtration of junk mails, typically in the form of a set of rules to
   dispose of mails based on keywords detected in headers or message body.
   There are some other methods for the purpose as well, but an adaptive
   email filtering system based on Bayesian technique that can learn from
   its user's mail preferences appears to be a better solution. It not only
   considers the keywords that identify spam, but also words that denote
   innocent or legitimate mail which makes the filter more efficient.
   However direct marketers discover new ways to evade even the Bayesian
   filters, so as to reach the potential customers. The way most commonly
   adopted by the spammers to mislead the Bayesian filters is injection of
   out of context text in the email. This paper aims at presenting a
   critical analysis of the various ways adopted by spammers to dodge the
   spam filters. Further we explore the Bayesian Noise Reduction (BNR)
   technique which attempts to solve this problem by identifying and
   eliminating the `out of context' data (so injected by spammers or
   otherwise) to provide a cleaner classification.},

Title = {Development of a new Peyronie's disease self-assessment screening app},
Journal = {TRANSLATIONAL ANDROLOGY AND UROLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV 30},
Abstract = { Peyronie's disease (PD) is an underdiagnosed and
   undertreated fibroproliferative disorder associated with the formation
   of plaques that results in penile curvature and discourages some men
   from seeking medical consultation. The PD self-assessment app, a digital
   application (app), was developed to increase PD awareness, provide men
   with a self-screening and educational tool for PD, and help eliminate
   barriers to seeking consultation with a physician. Prior to deployment,
   4 board-certified urologists provided qualitative reviews on the app's
   usability and utility as a screening tool. The PD self-assessment app
   features a questionnaire that addresses penile curvature, challenges
   with penetration, partner distress, and the impact on sexual
   experiences. The app uses the phone's camera lens to perform a live scan
   employing a mathematical algorithm to determine the degree of curvature
   of an erect penis. Results include a three-dimensional (3D) penile
   simulation and a two-dimensional (2D) penile outline, allowing the user
   to mark plaque locations and determine the maximum curvature without
   requiring personal photographs. The user can choose to email their
   answers to the questionnaire and the representative penile simulation
   results to their physician. The app also includes external links
   directing users to an educational website focused on PD and to help with
   finding a treating physician. The app was designed with privacy and
   security features including optional password protection, encryption of
   sensitive data, in-app storage of all screening results, and the erasing
   of all data when the app is uninstalled. Patients will be empowered to
   self-assess their PD and locate a PD-experienced physician privately and
   securely. The app is not designed for diagnosing, treating, curing, or
   preventing any medical conditions, or diseases, nor does it substitute
   for a medical consultation. For security, scanning technology, rather
   than personal photography, is adjunctive to the diagnosis process. The
   app is designed to be flexible and expandable for future updates. It
   aims to assist men and their partners in learning about PD, tracking
   penile deformity, and enabling communication with a health care provider
   (HCP).},

Abstract = {The rate of phishing attacks is increasing over time. Although hackers
   design emails with cognitive biases for their phishing attacks to
   succeed, little is known about how effectively these biases fool people
   via phishing emails. Also, little is known how machine learning
   algorithms can predict human tendency to get phished via phishing emails
   in the presence of human attributes. In this paper, the main objective
   is to investigate how the presence of two cognitive biases, authority
   bias (the tendency of humans to get influenced by the emails sent by
   authority) and hyperbolic discounting bias (the inclination of humans
   towards immediate rewards), influence human decision making via a
   phishing email detection simulation. In an experiment, 210 participants
   judged emails to be genuine or phishing. The next part of this research
   predicted the human responses to phishing emails captured in the
   experiment via machine learning models such as logistic regression (LR),
   multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), decision tree (DT), and Random Forest
   (RF). The results from the study conducted on humans revealed that the
   authority bias was more effective compared to hyperbolic discounting in
   phishing humans. Furthermore, the LR classifier effectively predicted
   human responses in the presence of cognitive biases and human attributes
   with training and test accuracy of around 90.77\% and 82.70\%,
   respectively. We discuss the implications of this work for real-world
   phishing attacks.},

Abstract = {Since healthcare information systems have many important data that can
   attract many adversaries, it is important to take the right steps to
   prevent data breaches. Recent studies suggested that 85\% of breaches
   involved a human element and the frequent patterns used are social
   engineerings. Therefore, many studies focus on making a better
   understanding of human behavior in cybersecurity and the factors that
   affect cybersecurity practices. However, there are only a few
   peer-reviewed studies that focus on the link between stress level and
   cybersecurity practices. In this study, we examined the link between
   stress level and cybersecurity practices among hospital employees in
   Indonesia by surveying 99 hospital workers. Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)
   was used to measure the employees' stress level and a new scale to
   measure hospital staff's risky cybersecurity practices was proposed.
   This study showed that both PSS and proposed cybersecurity practices
   scales are reliable with Cronbach's alpha value of more than 0.7. The
   survey results also revealed that hospital worker's higher stress levels
   correlate significantly with riskier cybersecurity practices (r(s) =
   0.305, p < 0.01). Besides, a higher stress level is also significantly
   linked to certain cybersecurity practices, such as clicking on a link in
   an email from an unknown sender, not preventing colleagues from viewing
   patients' information for a non-therapeutic purpose, posting patient
   information on social media, ignoring colleagues who engage in negative
   information security practices, and failing to create strong passwords.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of effective notifications of
   domain abuse or vulnerabilities to the domain owners, administrators, or
   webmasters. We have developed a scanner to test whether selected email
   aliases specified in RFC 2142 are correctly configured and whether
   notifications can be successfully delivered. We also test the
   reachability of email addresses collected from the DNS Start of
   Authority (SOA) records. Based on a measurement campaign of a large
   number of domains compared to the previous studies (4,602,907 domains),
   we show that domains are more reachable through SOA contacts. We find
   that the country-code TLD names are more reachable compared to the new
   gTLD names. We have also observed that the most used generic email alias
   is abuse (67.95\%). Using regression analysis, we show the relationship
   between the reachability of email addresses and the fact that names are
   hosted on large shared platforms or have a significant value. Our
   results confirm that direct notification channels are currently not
   scalable, so we propose a scheme that preserves user privacy in
   compliance with GDPR and supports large-scale vulnerability
   notifications.},

Abstract = {Cloud computing has been extending extensively, involving multiple users
   on the service it provides. Cloud based email is one of services
   provided by cloud computing with number of users expanding on yearly
   basis. Cloud computing faces concerning problem of security and privacy
   mainly based on its working environment. Identity authentication is one
   reliable method in cloud environment to identify users requesting for
   cloud services, currently user authentication in cloud computing is
   based on the credentials possessed by the user mostly username \&
   password. However, this method has vulnerability of being compromised by
   illegitimate users when users' passwords have been revealed or cracked.
   The paper proposes a more secure structure, i.e the two-factor
   authentication which authenticates by requiring the username/password
   pair also needs a second factor to completely grant access. The second
   factor is App stored in users' smart devices. Username \& password/Apps
   method will continue to allow users to set up passwords for their
   accounts, it will make a random compulsory code to be entered through
   App on smart phone devices hence keep privacy of cloud emails. Testing
   has been done with help of Python program environment. Comparing to
   recent related proposed schemes, our proposed scheme has advantage of
   high unbreakable security feature with low implement cost.},

Abstract = {Background: Nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson disease are a major factor of
   disease burden but are often underreported in clinical appointments. A
   digital tool has been developed to support the monitoring and management
   of nonmotor symptoms.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to establish evidence of the impact
   of the system on patient confidence, knowledge, and skills for
   self-management of nonmotor symptoms, symptom burden, and quality of
   life of people with Parkinson and their care partners. It will also
   evaluate the usability, acceptability, and potential for adoption of the
   system for people with Parkinson, care partners, and health care
   professionals.
   Methods: A mixed methods implementation and feasibility study based on
   the nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability
   framework will be conducted with 60 person with Parkinson-care partner
   dyads and their associated health care professionals. Participants will
   be recruited from outpatient clinics at the University Hospitals
   Plymouth NHS Trust Parkinson service. The primary outcome, patient
   activation, will be measured over the 12-month intervention period;
   secondary outcomes include the system's impact on health and well-being
   outcomes, safety, usability, acceptability, engagement, and costs.
   Semistructured interviews with a subset of participants will gather a
   more in-depth understanding of user perspectives and experiences with
   the system. Repeated measures analysis of variance will analyze change
   over time and thematic analysis will be conducted on qualitative data.
   The study was peer reviewed by the Parkinson's UK Non-Drug Approaches
   grant board and is pending ethical approval.
   Results: The study won funding in August 2021; data collection is
   expected to begin in December 2022.
   Conclusions: The study's success criteria will be affirming evidence
   regarding the system's feasibility, usability and acceptability, no
   serious safety risks identified, and an observed positive impact on
   patient activation. Results will be disseminated in academic
   peer-reviewed journals and in platforms and formats that are accessible
   to the general public, guided by patient and public collaborators.},

Abstract = {Phishing is an attempt to steal a user's identity. This is typically
   accomplished by sending an email message to a user, with a link
   directing the user to a web site used to collect personal information.
   Phishing detection systems typically rely on content filtering
   techniques, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify
   phishing messages. In the case of spear phishing, however, this may be
   ineffective because messages from a trusted source may contain little
   content. In order to handle such emerging spear phishing behavior, we
   propose as a first step the use of Spectral Clustering to analyze
   messages based on traffic behavior. In particular, Spectral Clustering
   analyzes the links between URL substrings for web sites found in the
   message contents. Cluster membership is then used to construct a Random
   Forest classifier for phishing. Data from the Phishing Email Corpus and
   the Spam Assassin Email Corpus are used to evaluate this approach.
   Performance evaluation metrics include the Area Under the receiver
   operating characteristic Curve (AUC), as well as accuracy, precision,
   recall, and the (harmonic mean) F measure. Performance of the integrated
   Spectral Clustering and Random Forest approach is found to provide
   significant improvements in all the metrics listed, compared to a
   content filtering technique such as LDA coupled with text message
   deletion done randomly or in an adaptive fashion using adversarial
   learning. The Spectral Clustering approach is robust against the absence
   of content. In particular, we show that Spectral Clustering yields
   (99.8\%, 97.8\%) for (AUC, F measure) compared to LDA that yields
   (94.6\%, 89.4\%) and (79.6\%, 57.9\%) when the content of the messages
   is reduced to 10\% of their original size using random and adversarial
   deletion, respectively. The difference is most striking at low False
   Positive (FP) rates.},

Abstract = {On modern operating systems, applications under the same user are
   separated from each other, for the purpose of protecting them against
   malware and compromised programs. Given the complexity of today's OSes,
   less clear is whether such isolation is effective against different kind
   of cross-app resource access attacks (called XARA in our research). To
   better understand the problem, on the less-studied Apple platforms, we
   conducted a systematic security analysis on MAC OS X and iOS. Our
   research leads to the discovery of a series of high-impact security
   weaknesses, which enable a sandboxed malicious app, approved by the
   Apple Stores, to gain unauthorized access to other apps' sensitive data.
   More specifically, we found that the inter-app interaction services,
   including the keychain, WebSocket and NSConnection on OS X and URL
   Scheme on OS X and iOS, can all be exploited by the malware to steal
   such confidential information as the passwords for iCloud, email and
   bank, and the secret token of Evernote. Further, the design of the App
   sandbox on OS X was found to be vulnerable, exposing an app's private
   directory to the sandboxed malware that hijacks its Apple Bundle ID. As
   a result, sensitive user data, like the notes and user contacts under
   Evernote and photos under WeChat, have all been disclosed.
   Fundamentally, these problems are caused by the lack of app-to-app and
   app-to-OS authentications. To better understand their impacts, we
   developed a scanner that automatically analyzes the binaries of OS X and
   iOS apps to determine whether proper protection is missing in their
   code. Running it on hundreds of binaries, we confirmed the pervasiveness
   of the weaknesses among high-impact Apple apps. Since the issues may not
   be easily fixed, we built a simple program that detects exploit attempts
   on OS X, helping protect vulnerable apps before the problems can be
   fully addressed. We further discuss the insights from this study and the
   lessons learnt for building a securer system.},

Abstract = {Bitcoin is designed to protect user anonymity (or pseudonymity) in a
   financial transaction, and has been increasingly adopted by major
   e-commerce websites such as Dell, PayPal and Expedia. While the
   anonymity of Bitcoin transactions has been extensively studied, little
   attention has been paid to the security of post-transaction
   correspondence. In a commercial application, the merchant and the user
   often need to engage in follow-up correspondence after a Bitcoin
   transaction is completed, e.g., to acknowledge the receipt of payment,
   to confirm the billing address, to arrange the product delivery, to
   discuss refund and so on. Currently, such follow-up correspondence is
   typically done in plaintext via email with no guarantee on
   confidentiality. Obviously, leakage of sensitive data from the
   correspondence (e.g., billing address) can trivially compromise the
   anonymity of Bitcoin users. In this paper, we initiate the first study
   on how to realise end-to-end secure communication between Bitcoin users
   in a post-transaction scenario without requiring any trusted third party
   or additional authentication credentials. This is an important new area
   that has not been covered by any IEEE or ISO/IEC security standard, as
   none of the existing PKI-based or password-based AKE schemes are
   suitable for the purpose. Instead, our idea is to leverage the Bitcoin's
   append-only ledger as an additional layer of authentication between
   previously confirmed transactions. This naturally leads to a new
   category of AKE protocols that bootstrap trust entirely from the block
   chain. We call this new category ``Bitcoin-based AKE{''} and present two
   concrete protocols: one is non-interactive with no forward secrecy,
   while the other is interactive with additional guarantee of forward
   secrecy. Finally, we present proof-of-concept prototypes for both
   protocols with experimental results to demonstrate their practical
   feasibility.},

Abstract = {Spam is a serious problem not only the number of floods but also more
   and more volatile type. It has caused a great impact on people's daily
   lives. Especially fraud spam, even cause huge losses to companies or
   individuals possibility. Therefore, it is imminent to filter spam
   efficiently. Existing spam filtering mechanism is mainly based on the
   character and content of the spam message. However, once the spam filter
   uses in other user's mailbox, the existing spam filtering techniques can
   not be well adapted. In this paper, we propose the adaptive spam
   filtering method for the above shortcomings. The method uses the
   unlabeled spam data that from other user or domain to enhance the
   adaptive and opposability of the anti-spam system. We use the transfer
   learning model to build the spam filtering system. A transfer learning
   model can use the untagged data, and migrate knowledge between different
   filter model, and improve the active collaboration of the filter.},

Abstract = {In the realm of cybersecurity, phishing stands as a prevalent cyber
   attack, where attackers employ various tactics to deceive users into
   gathering their sensitive information, potentially leading to identity
   theft or financial gain. Researchers have been actively working on
   advancing phishing webpage detection approaches to detect new phishing
   URLs, bolstering user protection. Nonetheless, the ever-evolving
   strategies employed by attackers, aimed at circumventing existing
   detection approaches and tools, present an ongoing challenge to the
   research community. This survey presents a systematic categorization of
   diverse phishing webpage detection approaches, encompassing URL-based,
   webpage content-based, third-party-based and visual techniques. Through
   a comprehensive review of these approaches and an in-depth analysis of
   existing literature, our study underscores current research gaps in
   phishing webpage detection. Furthermore, we suggest potential solutions
   to address some of these gaps, contributing valuable insights to the
   ongoing efforts to combat phishing attacks.},

Abstract = {EU data protection laws grant consumers the right to access the personal
   data that companies hold about them. In a first-of-its-kind longitudinal
   study, we examine how service providers have complied with subject
   access requests over four years. In three iterations between 2015 and
   2019, we sent subject access requests to vendors of 225 mobile apps
   popular in Germany. Throughout the iterations, 19 to 26 \% of the
   vendors were unreachable or did not reply at all. Our subject access
   requests were fulfilled in 15 to 53 \% of the cases, with an unexpected
   decline between the GDPR enforcement date and the end of our study. The
   remaining responses exhibit a long list of shortcomings, including
   severe violations of information security and data protection
   principles. Some responses even contained deceptive and misleading
   statements (7 to 13 \%). Further, 9 \% of the apps were discontinued and
   27 \% of the user accounts vanished during our study, mostly without
   proper notification about the consequences for our personal data. While
   we observe improvements for selected aspects over time, the results
   indicate that subject access request handling will be unsatisfactory as
   long as vendors accept such requests via email and process them
   manually.},

Abstract = {Mobile phones enable the collection of a wealth of private information,
   from unique identifiers (e.g., email addresses), to a user's location,
   to their text messages. This information can be harvested by apps and
   sent to third parties, which can use it for a variety of purposes. In
   this paper we perform the largest study of private information
   collection (PIC) on Android to date. Leveraging an anonymized dataset
   collected from the customers of a popular mobile security product, we
   analyze the flows of sensitive information generated by 2.1M unique apps
   installed by 17.3M users over a period of 21 months between 2018 and
   2019. We find that 87.2\% of all devices send private information to at
   least five different domains, and that actors active in different
   regions (e.g., Asia compared to Europe) are interested in collecting
   different types of information. The United States (62\% of the total)
   and China (7\% of total flows) are the countries that collect most
   private information. Our findings raise issues regarding data
   regulation, and would encourage policymakers to further regulate how
   private information is used by and shared among the companies and how
   accountability can be truly guaranteed.},

Abstract = {The fully decoupled radio access network (FD-RAN) divides the base
   station (BS) into three components: 1) the uplink data BS (UBS); 2) the
   downlink data BS (DBS); and 3) the control BS (CBS) to achieve an ultra
   flexible network. FD-RAN can easily realize dynamic multi-BS cooperation
   to boost throughput and guarantee users' quality of experience. However,
   as the number of cooperating BSs and concurrently accessed Internet of
   Things (IoT) devices increases, significant authentication and key
   agreement (AKA) overheads will be incurred, and the system becomes
   vulnerable to various security threats. This article proposes a novel
   lightweight AKA protocol that employs secret value sharing for secure
   key negotiation among BSs, user equipment and the core network (CN).
   Furthermore, multidevice of IoT access is optimized through aggregated
   message authentication codes with detecting functionality (AMAD) to
   efficiently manage and aggregate access requests. By utilizing
   interpolation polynomials and multiparty key agreement techniques, the
   proposed solution improves key negotiation efficiency while mitigating
   risks from man-in-the-middle (MitM) and Distributed Denial of Service
   (DDoS) attacks. Security analyses are conducted to validate the protocol
   while showcasing its superiority on computation, communication and
   transmission efficiency.},

Abstract = {In this paper a plan is suggested that is a combination of CAPTCHA
   security codes and WATERMARKING studies. With an increasing number of
   automated software bots and automated scripts that exploit public web
   services, the user is commonly required to solve a Turing test problem,
   namely a Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and
   Humans Apart (CAPTCHA), before they are allowed to use web services. The
   purpose of CAPTCHA is to block form submissions from spam bots automated
   scripts that harvest email address from publicly available web forms.
   Programmers have worked to create special algorithms that can read the
   distorted letters from images with the purpose of defeating CAPTCHA
   images. Strong CAPTCHA must be used to insure that spam bots will not
   pass and submit their information to forms. On the other hands, CAPTCHA
   stands for ``completely automated public Turing test to tell computers
   and humans apart.Watermarking and fingerprinting are part of the
   STEGANOGRAPHY.{''} A watermark is an image which appears on fine papers
   or on some documents to prevent counterfeiting. The watermark is
   designed to appear only when the paper is held at a particular angle, or
   against a black background. Standard paper usually does not include a
   watermark, as making a watermark will drive the cost of the paper up.
   Fine art papers use watermarks to identify the manufacturer, and
   companies such as banks frequently use specially watermarked paper for
   security. In this proposed topic we want to watermark an encryption
   information in the arbitrary image, then distort this image (by changing
   the location of components of image) and send it to the desired
   receiver. In the destination, receiver gets the image and he/she must
   detect the correct image and after that he/she can access to its
   information that is embedded on it. More details have been explained in
   the next section.},

Abstract = {An increasing variety of malware, such as worms, spyware and adware,
   threatens both personal and business computing. Remotely controlled bot
   networks of compromised systems are growing quickly. In this paper we
   tackle the problem of automated detection of break-ins caused by unknown
   malware targeting personal computers. We develop a host based system,
   BINDER (Break-IN DEtectoR), to detect break-ins by capturing user
   unintended malicious outbound connections (referred to as extrusions).
   To infer user intent, BINDER correlates outbound connections with
   user-driven input at the process level under the assumption that user
   intent is implied by user-driven input. Thus BINDER can detect a large
   class of unknown malware such as worms, spyware and adware without
   requiring signatures. We have successfully used BINDER to detect real
   world spyware on daily used computers and email worms on a controlled
   testbed with very small false positives.},

Abstract = {Software engineers regularly use JavaScript and Python for both
   front-end and back-end automation tasks. On top of JavaScript and
   Python, there are several frameworks to facilitate automation tasks
   further. Some of these frameworks are Node Manager Package (npm) and
   Python Package Index (PyPi), which are open source (OS) package
   libraries. The public registries npm and PyPi use to host packages allow
   any user with a verified email to publish code. The lack of a
   comprehensive scanning tool when publishing to the registry creates
   security concerns. Users can report malicious code on the registry;
   however, attackers can still cause damage until they remove their tool
   from the platform. Furthermore, several packages depend on each other,
   making them more vulnerable to a bad package in the dependency tree. The
   heavy code reuse creates security artifacts developers have to consider,
   such as the package reach. This project will illustrate a high-level
   overview of common risks associated with OS registries and the package
   dependency structure. There are several attack types, such as
   typosquatting and combosquatting, in the OS package registries. Outdated
   packages pose a security risk, and we will examine the extent of
   technical lag present in the npm environment. In this paper, our main
   contribution consists of a survey of common threats in OS registries.
   Afterward, we will offer countermeasures to mitigate the risks
   presented. These remedies will heavily focus on the applications of
   Machine Learning (ML) to detect suspicious activities. To the best of
   our knowledge, the ML-focused countermeasures are the first proposed
   possible solutions to the security problems listed. In addition, this
   project is the first survey of threats in npm and PyPi, although several
   studies focus on a subset of threats.},

Abstract = {In this paper we examine the standard password recovery process of large
   Internet services such as Gmail, Facebook, and Twitter. Although most of
   these services try to maintain user privacy, with regard to registration
   information and other personal information provided by the user, we
   demonstrate that personal information can still be obtained by
   unauthorized individuals or attackers. This information includes the
   full (or partial) email address, phone number, friends list, address,
   etc. We examine different scenarios and demonstrate how the details
   revealed in the password recovery process can be used to deduct more
   focused information about users.},

Abstract = {This letter investigates a novel aerial intelligent reflecting surface
   (IRS)-assisted secure mobile communication system. In particular, the
   IRS is mounted on a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to help a source
   transmit its confidential messages to a legitimate mobile user in the
   presence of a mobile eavesdropper. The aerial IRS can adjust its
   trajectory and phase-shift to track the moving user and provide safer
   communication services. Furthermore, due to the mobility of the UAV,
   user and eavesdropper, the effect of Doppler shifts is also taken into
   consideration in the channel model. Under such a setup, we formulate an
   average secrecy rate maximization problem to jointly optimize the 3D
   trajectory of the UAV and the phase-shift matrix of the aerial IRS. To
   deal with this non-convex optimization problem, we decompose the
   original problem into two subproblems and propose an iterative algorithm
   to determine its suboptimal solution. Numerical results show that the
   proposed aerial IRS-assisted 3D joint design can significantly improve
   the secrecy rate compared to the benchmark schemes.},

Abstract = {Text-to-Image (T2I) models have advanced significantly, but their
   growing popularity raises security concerns due to their potential to
   generate harmful images. To address these issues, we propose UPAM, a
   novel framework to evaluate the robustness of T2I models from an attack
   perspective. Unlike prior methods that focus solely on textual defenses,
   UPAM unifies the attack on both textual and visual defenses.
   Additionally, it enables gradient-based optimization, overcoming
   reliance on enumeration for improved efficiency and effectiveness. To
   handle cases where T2I models block image outputs due to defenses, we
   introduce Sphere-Probing Learning (SPL) to enable optimization even
   without image results. Following SPL, our model bypasses defenses,
   inducing the generation of harmful content. To ensure semantic alignment
   with attacker intent, we propose Semantic-Enhancing Learning (SEL) for
   precise semantic control. UPAM also prioritizes the naturalness of
   adversarial prompts using In-context Naturalness Enhancement (INE),
   making them harder for human examiners to detect. Additionally, we
   address the issue of iterative queries-common in prior methods and
   easily detectable by API defenders-by introducing Transferable Attack
   Learning (TAL), allowing effective attacks with minimal queries.
   Extensive experiments validate UPAM's superiority in effectiveness,
   efficiency, naturalness, and low query detection rates.},

Abstract = {Facing abusive traffic from the Tor anonymity network, online service
   providers discriminate against Tor users. In this study, we characterize
   not only the extent of such discrimination but also the nature of the
   undesired traffic originating from the Tor network-a task complicated by
   Tor's need to maintain user anonymity. We address this challenge by
   leveraging multiple independent data sources: email complaints sent to
   exit operators, commercial IP blacklists, webpage crawls via Tor, and
   privacy-sensitive measurements of our own Tor exit nodes. As part of our
   study, we also develop methods for classifying email complaints and an
   interactive crawler to find subtle forms of discrimination, and deploy
   our own exits in various configurations to understand which are prone to
   discrimination. We find that conservative exit policies are ineffective
   in preventing the blacklisting of exit relays. However, a majority of
   the attacks originating from Tor generate high traffic volume,
   suggesting the possibility of detection and prevention without violating
   Tor users' privacy.},

Abstract = {Phishing attacks continue to evolve with time and the attackers are
   always ahead of the existing mitigation plans. The more technology
   advances, the more sophisticated phishing attacks become. As more people
   rely on technology to conduct their online businesses, the need for
   secure Mobile Intelligent Agents (MIAs) systems becomes higher. MIAs are
   software that execute functions or duties such as managing electronic
   mail, gathering, and sending out information on behalf of an online
   user. MIAs play a vital role in carrying out electronic commerce
   activities whether from business-to-customer, customer-to-customer, or
   business-to-business. In this paper, we use Decision Tree (DT) to
   accurately predict the status of a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and
   flag those predicted to be phishing. The DT algorithm extract URL
   features such as the domain name, URL length, host name, page ranking,
   etc., and feeds them into the model which then makes status prediction.
   The extracted features are then filtered into the model to improve its
   future predictions. The proposed model has a prediction accuracy of
   91.3\% and it is also cost effective as well as easy to use. The other
   benefit of the proposed solution is its capability to flag phishing URL
   and prevent a user from launching the web browser thereby protecting
   their personal information from being stolen by criminals.},

   important to ensure the security of an application. Particularly in
   banking sector lot of sensitive information is available in their
   database. Although the present technique using password mechanism for
   bank authentication, the attackers may take the opportunity to get the
   user details and act upon. To overcome these issues our proposal
   provides multi factor authentication to secure users bank account
   details. Apart from using password to access the bank account, our
   proposal sends OTP to the user email account and also use facial
   recognition to authenticate the user to access their bank details and
   allow them to do transaction. Our proposal uses Local Binary Pattern
   Histogram (LBPH) algorithm for facial recognition because of its 90.80\%
   accuracy and got good results to access the bank account.},

Abstract = {Background: The objectives of this survey study were to assess
   duodenoscope precleaning and manual cleaning times, identify human
   factors issues in duodenoscope reprocessing workflow or ergonomics, and
   ascertain any best practices in duodenoscope reprocessing.Methods:
   Researchers developed the confidential, qualitative, online Duodenoscope
   Reprocessing Workflow and Ergonomic Design Human Factors Survey with an
   intended audience of healthcare workers (HCWs) who routinely perform
   duodenoscope precleaning or manual cleaning. The unrestricted survey
   link was distrib-uted to target HCW email addresses in December 2020;
   the survey closed in January 2021.Results: Three hundred and forty-one
   individuals completed the survey. Most respondents complete
   duode-noscope precleaning in 10 minutes or less and manual cleaning in
   16-to-30 minutes. Most respondents' facil-ities use fixed distal endcap
   duodenoscopes. Most respondents experience pressure to work faster when
   cleaning duodenoscopes and reported that cleaning duodenoscopes caused
   fatigue or discomfort in at least one body part. Mentoring HCWs and
   retaining experienced staff were 2 primary duodenoscope reprocessing
   best practices identified by respondents.Discussion and Conclusions: To
   enhance duodenoscope cleaning, facilities should provide ample
   reprocess-ing work spaces with incorporated height-adjustable work
   surfaces, train HCWs on validated duodenoscope reprocessing
   instructions, provide step-by-step instructions for HCWs when
   duodenoscope cleaning is per-formed, mentor reprocessing HCWs, and
   retain experienced staff.(c) 2022 Association for Professionals in

Abstract = {The beauty of identity-based encryption (IBE) lies in the convenience of
   public key handling, in the sense that any identification such as an
   email address, a name, or an IP number can serve as a public key of a
   party. However, such convenience is not inherited by a system where a
   party possesses many identities (e.g., many email addresses) and has to
   use them as his public keys. When this system is handled with a standard
   IBE, the user must manage all the private keys that are associated with
   all the public keys (identities). However, keeping these private keys is
   inconvenient to the user. In this paper, we solve this problem by
   proposing a novel identity-based encryption where we set a private key
   that maps multiple public keys (identities); namely, we can use a
   private key to decrypt multiple ciphertexts; each was encrypted with a
   different public key (identity).},

Abstract = {TLS is widely used to add confidentiality, authenticity and integrity to
   application layer protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP3, and FTP.
   However, TLS does not bind a TCP connection to the intended application
   layer protocol. This allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to redirect TLS
   traffic to a different TLS service endpoint on another IP address and/or
   port. For example, if subdomains share a wildcard certificate, an
   attacker can redirect traffic from one subdomain to another, resulting
   in a valid TLS session. This breaks the authentication of TLS and
   cross-protocol attacks may be possible where the behavior of one service
   may compromise the security of the other at the application layer.
   In this paper, we investigate cross-protocol attacks on TLS in general
   and conduct a systematic case study on web servers, redirecting HTTPS
   requests from a victim's web browser to SMTP, IMAP, POP3, and FTP
   servers. We show that in realistic scenarios, the attacker can extract
   session cookies and other private user data or execute arbitrary
   JavaScript in the context of the vulnerable web server, therefore
   bypassing TLS and web application security.
   We evaluate the real-world attack surface of web browsers and
   widely-deployed email and FTP servers in lab experiments and with
   internet-wide scans. We find that 1.4M web servers are generally
   vulnerable to cross-protocol attacks, i.e., TLS application data
   confusion is possible. Of these, 114k web servers can be attacked using
   an exploitable application server. Finally, we discuss the effectiveness
   of TLS extensions such as Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)
   and Server Name Indiciation (SNI) in mitigating these and other
   cross-protocol attacks.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel safe, passive, and robust control law
   for mechanical systems. The proposed approach addresses safety from a
   physical human-robot interaction perspective, where a robot must not
   only stay inside a pre-defined region, but respect velocity constraints
   and ensure passivity with respect to external perturbations that may
   arise from a human or the environment. The proposed control is written
   in closed-form, behaves well even during singular configurations, and
   allows any nominal control law to be applied inside the operating region
   as long as the safety requirements (e.g., velocity) are adhered to. The
   proposed method is implemented on a 6-DOF robot to demonstrate its
   effectiveness during a physical human-robot interaction task.},

Year = {2024},
Volume = {5},
Pages = {1880-1898},
Abstract = {OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a widely used authentication standard for the
   Web. In this work, we define a new Identity Certification Token (ICT) to
   enable end-to-end user authentication by using and extending OIDC's
   native mechanisms. An ICT can be thought of as a JSON-based, short-lived
   user certificate for end-to-end user authentication without the need for
   cumbersome key management. A user can request an ICT from his OpenID
   Provider (OP) and use it to prove his identity to other users that trust
   the OP. We call this approach Open Identity Certification with OpenID
   Connect (OIDC2) and compare it to other well-known end-to-end
   authentication methods. Unlike certificates, OIDC2 does not require
   installation and can be easily used on multiple devices, making it more
   user-friendly. We outline protocols for implementing OIDC2 based on
   existing standards. We discuss the trust relationship between entities
   involved in OIDC2, propose a classification of OPs' trust level, and
   propose authentication with multiple ICTs from different OPs. We explain
   how different applications such as video conferencing, instant
   messaging, and email can benefit from ICTs for end-to-end authentication
   and recommend validity periods for ICTs. To test OIDC2, we provide a
   simple extension to existing OIDC server software and evaluate its
   performance.},

Abstract = {Women often delay moving to VAW shelters if their companion animals'
   safety is not ensured. Yet, few shelters accommodate them together. The
   purpose of this study is to explore what may help to promote services
   for women with companion animals facing violence, through learning from
   professionals who already provide support. Our email survey with VAW
   shelters in Ontario, Canada identified services and potential
   interviewees. Nine semi-structured telephone interviews with
   professionals were conducted to explore their experiences and views on
   human-animal relationships. All agencies that provided onsite programs,
   plus one about to start, participated. We utilized Critical Animal
   Studies as a theory to understand human-animal relationships through
   concepts such as intersectionality, anthropocentrism, speciesism, and
   feminist ethics of responsibility. The study found: (1) seven approaches
   shelters used to help women with companion animals; (2) programs that
   accept companion animals helped women move to shelters quickly but also
   affirmed women's mutually respectful relationships with companion
   animals; (3) shelters also benefited, including expanding support from
   local communities and opportunities to educate them. The study suggests
   that by shifting ontological and theoretical approaches and including a
   critical examination of human-animal relationships at interpersonal and
   social structural levels, professional education promotes mobilizing
   resources for women with companion animals.},

Title = {B-AVIBench: Toward Evaluating the Robustness of Large Vision-Language

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {20},
Pages = {1434-1446},
Abstract = {Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown significant progress in
   responding well to visual-instructions from users. However, these
   instructions, encompassing images and text, are susceptible to both
   intentional and inadvertent attacks. Despite the critical importance of
   LVLMs' robustness against such threats, current research in this area
   remains limited. To bridge this gap, we introduce B-AVIBench, a
   framework designed to analyze the robustness of LVLMs when facing
   various Black-box Adversarial Visual-Instructions (B-AVIs), including
   four types of image-based B-AVIs, ten types of text-based B-AVIs, and
   nine types of content bias B-AVIs (such as gender, violence, cultural,
   and racial biases, among others). We generate 316K B-AVIs encompassing
   five categories of multimodal capabilities (ten tasks) and content bias.
   We then conduct a comprehensive evaluation involving 14 open-source
   LVLMs to assess their performance. B-AVIBench also serves as a
   convenient tool for practitioners to evaluate the robustness of LVLMs
   against B-AVIs. Our findings and extensive experimental results shed
   light on the vulnerabilities of LVLMs, and highlight that inherent
   biases exist even in advanced closed-source LVLMs like GeminiProVision
   and GPT-4V. This underscores the importance of enhancing the robustness,
   security, and fairness of LVLMs. The source code and benchmark are
   available at https://github.com/zhanghao5201/B-AVIBench.},

Abstract = {Phishing kits allow adversaries with little or no technical experience
   to launch phishing websites in a short time. Past research has found
   such phishing kits that contain backdoors (e.g., obfuscated email
   addresses), which are intentionally added by the kit developers to
   obtain the phished data. In this work, we augment on prior research by
   exploring several ways in which security flaws in phishing kits make the
   victim data accessible to a wider set of adversaries beyond the kit
   deployers and kit developers. We implement an automated framework for
   kit collection and analysis, which includes a custom command-line PHP
   execution tool (for dynamic analysis) along with other open-source
   tools. Our analysis focuses on finding backdoors (e.g., obfuscated email
   address, command injection), measuring the extent of disclosure of
   sensitive information (e.g., via exposed plaintext files, hardcoded
   Telegram bot tokens, hardcoded admin console passwords) and detecting
   security vulnerabilities in phishing kits. We analyze 4238 distinct
   phishing kits (from a set of 26,281 compressed files collected from
   several sources over a span of 15 months), each having unique SHA-1 hash
   value. We found that 3.9\% of the analyzed kits contained at least one
   form of backdoor. We also found hardcoded admin console passwords and
   API keys used to access third party services, in 8.3\% and 16\% of the
   analyzed kits, respectively. In addition, 15.8\% of the analyzed kits
   wrote stolen information (PII) of users in plaintext files; 5.6\% kits
   did not restrict external access to these plaintext files, leading to
   exposure of sensitive phished data (e.g., 178,504 passwords, 133,248
   email addresses, 1253 credit card numbers). Furthermore, 11.7\% of the
   analyzed kits contained hardcoded Telegram bots; we obtained invite
   links to join Telegram chats in 0.5\% kits, and found them to expose
   chat messages containing sensitive PII information of victims (e.g.,
   73,342 passwords, 141,095 email addresses, 3584 credit card numbers). We

Abstract = {Traditional security models based on distinguishing trusted from
   untrusted pieces of data and program behavior continue to face
   difficulties keeping up with attackers levels of sophistication and
   ingenuity. In this position paper, we present a novel computing paradigm
   for trustworthy computing whose application, operating system (OS) and
   architecture can leverage social trust to enhance the robustness and
   diversity of security mechanisms of any Internet-based computing
   environment. Our model would allow online social network (OSN) users to
   assign trust values to her friends in a privacy-preserving fashion and
   maintain a trust repository with trust values for objects like URLs,
   email addresses, IP addresses and other pieces of data that can be
   consumed by a socially-aware OS, allowing for finegrained trust
   decisions that take into account user context and add diversity to host
   behavior. Our model also automatically infer trust values for people a
   user is not directly connected. In this paper we sketch the design of a
   socially-aware operating system kernel and identify several research
   challenges for this new paradigm.},

Abstract = {Faster than any technology before, Information and Communication
   technologies (ICTs) continue to change economies and societies in ways
   affecting many aspects of human life. Already after a short time
   organisations and individuals have become so dependent upon proper
   functioning of highly complex and hardly understandable ICT-systems that
   any deviation from ``normal{''} behaviour may have adversary, if not
   damaging effects. Contemporary technologies are in many cases designed
   and implemented without adequate provisions for safe and secure
   functioning. These systems can easily be attacked, even by experimenting
   boys at the age of puberty. e.g. by injecting viruses and worms into The
   Internet, which then rapidly propagates these malicious gifts (in some
   cases even in epidemic amounts of up to 100 million emailed worms per 24
   hours) into enterprises, offices, schools and everybody's PC. Internet
   communication protocols are weakly designed, and it is easy to
   ``spoof{''} ones email address, to ``sniff{''} and to intercept
   messages, such as transfer of electronic funds. To protect these already
   overly complex systems, the usual solution is to add more complexity:
   firewalls, antivirus software and encryption. Two types of reaction to
   ICT related vulnerabilities can be observed. Some users have a ``don't
   care{''} strategy, especially young people who leave a data trail of
   personal behaviour when surfing websites with potentially interesting
   economic or sociological content. Other users wish to exclude all risks
   and follow a strategy of ``don't use{''}. Both reactions are undesirable
   in the Information Society. Education on how to work with unsafe and
   insecure systems may help to protect users from undesired side-effects
   of ICT work.},

Abstract = {Data deduplication is a technique to eliminate duplicate data in order
   to save storage space and enlarge upload bandwidth, which has been
   applied by cloud storage systems. However, a cloud storage provider
   (CSP) may tamper user data or cheat users to pay unused storage for
   duplicate data that are only stored once. Although previous solutions
   adopt message-locked encryption along with Proof of Retrievability (PoR)
   to check the integrity of deduplicated encrypted data, they ignore
   proving the correctness of duplication check during data upload and
   require the same file to be derived into same verification tags, which
   suffers from brute-force attacks and restricts users from flexibly
   creating their own individual verification tags. In this paper, we
   propose a verifiable deduplication scheme called VeriDedup to address
   the above problems. It can guarantee the correctness of duplication
   check and support flexible tag generation for integrity check over
   encrypted data deduplication in an integrative way. Concretely, we
   propose a novel Tag-flexible Deduplication-supported Integrity Check
   Protocol (TDICP) based on Private Information Retrieval (PIR) by
   introducing a novel verification tag called note set, which allows
   multiple users holding the same file to generate their individual
   verification tags and still supports tag deduplication at the CSP.
   Furthermore, we make the first attempt to guarantee the correctness of
   data duplication check by introducing a novel User Determined
   Duplication Check Protocol (UDDCP) based on Private Set Intersection
   (PSI), which can resist a CSP from providing a fake duplication check
   result to users. Security analysis shows the correctness and soundness
   of our scheme. Simulation studies based on real data show the efficacy
   and efficiency of our proposed scheme and its significant advantages
   over prior arts.},

Abstract = {Internet services like the World Wide Web or email programs are already
   widely in use for private and business work. Unfortunately, with every
   access a lot of user-specific information is leaked. Hence, using
   popular Internet-services results in threats against user privacy, as
   this data can be eavesdropped by attackers or collected by service
   providers in order to create user profiles. To defeat such threats
   anonymizer services have been introduced especially for anonymous email
   and net news. But the available anonymizing services lack a lot of
   deficiencies and do not provide the required degree of anonymity to
   Internet users. This is mainly because theses services have been
   implemented in a rather ad hoc manner lacking a systematic analysis.
   The Anonymous-project aimed at revealing and overcoming the deficiencies
   of existing approaches by following a systematic methodology. Our paper
   summarizes the main results of the Anonymous-project. It explains the
   problems and limitations of current anonymizing services and presents
   our new services.},

Abstract = {The certificate authority model for authenticating public keys of
   websites has been attacked in recent years, and several proposals have
   been made to reinforce it. We develop and extend certificate
   transparency, a proposal in this direction, so that it efficiently
   handles certificate revocation. We show how this extension can be used
   to build a secure end-to-end email or messaging system using PKI with no
   requirement to trust certificate authorities, or to rely on complex
   peer-to-peer key-signing arrangements such as PGP. This makes end-to-end
   encrypted mail possible, with apparently few additional usability issues
   compared to unencrypted mail (specifically, users do not need to
   understand or concern themselves with keys or certificates). Underlying
   these ideas is a new attacker model appropriate for cloud computing,
   which we call ``malicious-but-cautious{''}.},

Title = {Privacy-preserving spam filtering using homomorphic and functional
   encryption},
Journal = {COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {197},

Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Conventional spam classification requires the end-users to reveal the
   content of incoming emails to a classifier so that text analysis can be
   performed. On the other hand, new cryptographic primitives allow this
   classification task to be performed on encrypted emails without
   revealing the email contents, hence preserves user data privacy. In this
   paper, we construct a spam classification framework that enables the
   classification of encrypted emails. Our model is based on a neural
   network with a quadratic network component and a multi-layer perceptron
   network component. The quadratic network architecture is compatible with
   the operation of an existing quadratic functional encryption scheme. To
   protect email content privacy, we proposed two spam classification
   solutions based on homomorphic encryption (HE) and functional encryption
   (FE) that enables our classifiers to predict the label of encrypted
   emails. The evaluation results on real-world spam datasets indicate that
   our proposed spam classification solutions achieve accuracies over 95\%.
   Our performance study and security analysis provide pros and cons of
   each proposed solution. For instance, the FE solution predicts a label
   of an encrypted email in less than 31 s whereas the HE solution takes up
   to 265 s to do so. Nonetheless, the HE solution is not prone to
   potential information leakage as the FE solution.},

   shared secrets or a heavyweight public-key infrastructure with
   user-specific digital certificates and, as such, lack general support

   Simple Authentication for the Web (SAW) facilitates dynamic user bases
   in the context of web site logins by enabling users to authenticate to
   personal messaging identifiers (e.g., email addresses, IM handles, cell
   phone numbers). SAW, however, is ill-suited for wireless authentication
   because, in most cases, it is dependent on client-side Internet
   connectivity. Wireless Authentication using Remote Passwords (WARP)
   overcomes this constraint by building a hybrid protocol that combines
   the principles of SAW authentication with the Secure Remote Password
   (SRP) protocol.},

Abstract = {Objectives To conduct an independent study investigating how adults
   perceive the usability and functionality of the `National Health Service
   (NHS) COVID-19' application (app). This study aims to highlight
   strengths and provide recommendations to improve adoption of future
   contact tracing developments. Design A 60-item, anonymous online
   questionnaire, disseminated through social media outlets and email lists
   by a team from Imperial College London. Setting England. Participants
   Convenience sample of 1036 responses, from participants aged 18 years
   and above, between December 2020 and January 2021. Primary outcome
   measures Evaluate the compliance and public attitude towards the `NHS
   COVID-19' app regarding its functionality and features. This included
   whether participants' expectations were met, and their thoughts on the
   app privacy and security. Furthermore, to distinguish how usability,
   perception, and adoption differed with varying demographics and user
   values. Results Fair compliance with the app features was identified,
   meeting expectations of the 62.1\% of participants who stated they
   downloaded it after weighted analysis. However, participants finding the
   interface challenging were less likely to read information in the app
   and had a lesser understanding of its functionality. Furthermore, little
   understanding regarding the app's functionality and privacy concerns was
   a possible reason why users did not download it. A readability analysis
   of the text revealed information within the app was conveyed at a level
   that may be too complex for up to 43\% of the UK population. The study
   highlighted issues related to the potential of false positives caused by
   the design choices in the `Check-In' feature. Conclusion This study
   showed that while the `NHS COVID-19' app was viewed positively, there
   remained issues regarding participants' perceived knowledge of app
   functionality, potentially affecting compliance. Therefore, we
   recommended improvements regarding the delivery and presentation of the
   app's information, and highlighted the potential need for the ability to
   check out of venues to reduce the number of false positive contacts.},

Abstract = {The widespread demand for online privacy, also fueled by
   widely-publicized demonstrations of session hijacking attacks against
   popular websites, has spearheaded the increasing deployment of HTTPS.
   However, many websites still avoid ubiquitous encryption due to
   performance or compatibility issues. The prevailing approach in these
   cases is to force critical functionality and sensitive data access over
   encrypted connections, while allowing more innocuous functionality to be
   accessed over HTTP. In practice, this approach is prone to flaws that
   can expose sensitive information or functionality to third parties.
   In this paper, we conduct an in-depth assessment of a diverse set of
   major websites and explore what functionality and information is exposed
   to attackers that have hijacked a user's HTTP cookies. We identify a
   recurring pattern across websites with partially deployed HTTPS; service
   personalization inadvertently results in the exposure of private
   information. The separation of functionality across multiple cookies
   with different scopes and inter-dependencies further complicates
   matters, as imprecise access control renders restricted account
   functionality accessible to non-session cookies. Our cookie hijacking
   study reveals a number of severe flaws; attackers can obtain the user's
   home and work address and visited websites from Google, Bing and Baidu
   expose the user's complete search history, and Yahoo allows attackers to
   extract the contact list and send emails from the user's account.
   Furthermore, e-commerce vendors such as Amazon and Ebay expose the
   user's purchase history (partial and full respectively), and almost
   every website exposes the user's name and email address. Ad networks
   like Doubleclick can also reveal pages the user has visited. To fully
   evaluate the practicality and extent of cookie hijacking, we explore
   multiple aspects of the online ecosystem, including mobile apps, browser
   security mechanisms, extensions and search bars. To estimate the extent
   of the threat, we run IRB-approved measurements on a subset of our
   university's public wireless network for 30 days, and detect over 282K
   accounts exposing the cookies required for our hijacking attacks. We
   also explore how users can protect themselves and find that, while
   mechanisms such as the EFF's HTTPS Everywhere extension can reduce the
   attack surface, HTTP cookies are still regularly exposed. The privacy
   implications of these attacks become even more alarming when considering
   how they can be used to deanonymize Tor users. Our measurements suggest
   that a significant portion of Tor users may currently be vulnerable to
   cookie hijacking.},

Abstract = {Although phishing is the most common social engineering tactic employed
   by cyber criminals, not everyone is equally susceptible. An important
   finding emerging across several research studies on phishing is that a
   subset of employees is especially susceptible to social engineering
   tactics and is responsible for a disproportionate number of successful
   phishing attempts. Sometimes referred to as repeat clickers, these
   employees habitually fail simulated phishing tests and are suspected of
   being responsible for a significant number of real-world phishing
   related data breaches. In contrast to repeat clickers, protective
   stewards are those employees who never fail simulated phishing exercises
   and habitually report phishing simulations to their security
   departments. This study explored some of the potential causes of these
   persistent behaviors (both good and bad) by administering six
   semi-structured interviews (three repeat clickers and three protective
   stewards). Surprisingly, both groups were able to identify message cues
   for identifying potentially malicious emails. Repeat clickers reported a
   more internally oriented locus of control and higher confidence in their
   ability to identify phishing emails, but also described more rigid email
   checking habits than did protective stewards. One unexpected finding was
   that repeat clickers failed to recall an identifier which they were
   explicitly informed that they would need to later recall, while the
   protective stewards recalled the identifier without error. Due to the
   small sample and exploratory nature of this study additional research
   should seek to confirm whether these findings extrapolate to larger
   populations.},

Abstract = {Investigating network and computer related crime requires the
   combination of heterogeneous sources of reliable evidential weight.
   Information such as name, surname, email address, login details, social
   network account and banking details may provide insight on the identity
   of the device, however, it does not guarantee the identity of the entity
   using the device. Several sources of potential evidence have been
   adapted for digital investigation processes. As a probable complementary
   source of evidence, this study proposed the integration of the semantic
   properties of web-browser history into digital forensics. To achieve
   this aim, the study developed a web-browser analysis tool which is
   independent of the type of browser. Experimental process was carried
   using nine users. Cosine and Jaccard similarity functions and motifs
   similarity measures were used to explore the probability of attributing
   a user based on web-browser history data. The result substantiates the
   theoretical assertion of the reliability of the semantic characteristics
   of web-browser information. Using the developed tool and the semantic
   properties of web-browser data, a forensic investigator can complement
   the evidential weight of potential digital evidence used in a forensic
   investigation. This result can also be used as a complementary metrics
   for strengthening security and digital forensic auditing process.},

Abstract = {Asynchronous digital communication is a widely applied and well-known
   form of information exchange. Most pieces of technology make use of some
   variation of asynchronous communication systems, be it messaging or
   email applications. This allows recipients to process digital messages
   immediately (synchronous) or whenever they have time (asynchronous),
   meaning that purely digital interruptions can be mitigated easily. Mixed
   Reality systems have the potential to not only handle digital
   interruptions but also interruptions in physical space, e.g., caused by
   co-workers in workspaces or learning environments. However, the benefits
   of such systems previously remained untested in the context of Mixed
   Reality. We conducted a user study (N=26) to investigate the impact that
   the timing of task delivery has on the participants' performance,
   workflow, and emotional state. Participants had to perform several
   cognitively demanding tasks in a Mixed Reality workspace. Inside the
   virtual workspace, we simulated in-person task delivery either during
   tasks (i.e., interrupting the participant) or between tasks (i.e.,
   delaying the interruption). Our results show that delaying interruptions
   has a significant impact on subjective metrics like the perceived
   performance and workload.},

Abstract = {Now a day's Internet has evolved in such a way that we cannot even think
   our life without internet. The most popular usages over internet is
   messaging. Messaging can be in different form like simple text messaging
   or email conversation. But it is always questionable that, whatever we
   are sending over internet it is secured or not? And if it is not
   secured, how can our message be more secured? Answer is our message can
   be encrypted before sending to other user to minimize the chances of
   getting leaked in between. If we can encode the message in such a form
   that nobody will not understand except receiver then message will be
   secured in public medium too. Therefore to safeguard the information
   from attacks, number of data/information hiding methods have evolved
   various techniques can be used to in sending messages in a secure
   manner. This paper emphasizes the problem and provides some possible
   advance to solve this problem.},

Abstract = {Recent work in security and systems has embraced the use of machine
   learning (ML) techniques for identifying misbehavior, e.g. email spam
   and fake (Sybil) users in social networks. However, ML models are
   typically derived from fixed datasets, and must be periodically
   retrained. In adversarial environments, attackers can adapt by modifying
   their behavior or even sabotaging ML models by polluting training data.
   In this paper1, we perform an empirical study of adversarial attacks
   against machine learning models in the context of detecting malicious
   crowdsourcing systems, where sites connect paying users with workers
   willing to carry out malicious campaigns. By using human workers, these
   systems can easily circumvent deployed security mechanisms, e.g.
   CAPTCHAs. We collect a dataset of malicious workers actively performing
   tasks on Weibo, China's Twitter, and use it to develop ML-based
   detectors. We show that traditional ML techniques are accurate
   (95\%-99\%) in detection but can be highly vulnerable to adversarial
   attacks, including simple evasion attacks (workers modify their
   behavior) and powerful poisoning attacks (where administrators tamper
   with the training set). We quantify the robustness of ML classifiers by
   evaluating them in a range of practical adversarial models using ground
   truth data. Our analysis provides a detailed look at practical
   adversarial attacks on ML models, and helps defenders make informed
   decisions in the design and configuration of ML detectors.},

Title = {Development and implementation of PROgmatic: A clinical trial management
   system for pragmatic multi-centre trials, optimised for electronic data
   capture and patient-reported outcomes},

Abstract = {Background Many clinical trials are conducted as explanatory trials, but
   the applicability of results from explanatory trials to clinical
   practice may be questioned. Pragmatic trials elucidate both benefits and
   harms of an intervention under conditions close to daily clinical
   practice. We have planned a pragmatic multi-centre trial in patients
   with Graves' hyperthyroidism. However, trial management is a complicated
   task in pragmatic trials, due to limited interaction between
   participants and trial personnel.
   Purpose The aim of this project was to develop and implement PROgmatic,
   a fully integrated trial management system for pragmatic multi-centre
   trials, optimised for electronic data capture and patient-reported
   outcomes (PROs).
   Methods Necessary tasks and logistical challenges that should be handled
   by PROgmatic were identified, and the system was designed and developed
   to handle these tasks. A combination of generic applications and custom
   coding was applied to develop an integrated system that met the required
   needs. PROgmatic features include secure web-based data entry;
   electronic case report forms (eCRFs); central participant registration
   and randomisation; automated emails linking to electronic PROs;
   automated reminders to participants; automated notifications to trial
   personnel regarding booking of trial visits, safety and compliance
   alerts; and monitoring of trial progress. PROgmatic underwent rigorous
   pilot testing, including data verification and validation, before it was
   released for trial management.
   Results PROgmatic was successfully implemented in the GRAves' Selenium
   Supplementation (GRASS) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01611896) December
   2012. The feedback from trial personnel on usability and utility has
   been positive, and PROgmatic has handled all intended tasks properly.
   Limitations Implementation of PROgmatic in future studies requires
   adaptation of the custom coding. Not all email systems accept emails
   with active links, and participants who use these systems therefore need
   to complete paper surveys.
   Conclusions PROgmatic facilitated the complex task of conducting a
   pragmatic multi-centre trial. The automated electronic capture of PRO
   data is time saving and reduces the risk of erroneous data entry. Email
   notifications to trial personnel combined with serially activated eCRFs
   that logically lead patient flow through the trial have helped making
   the pragmatic trial feasible. PROgmatic provides a template for other
   pragmatic multi-centre trials with patient-reported measures as
   high-priority outcomes.},

Abstract = {Efficient user revocation in Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) has been a
   challenging problem and has been the subject of several research efforts
   in the literature. Among them, the tree-based revocation approach, due
   to Boldyreva, Goyal and Kumar, is probably the most efficient one. In
   this approach, a trusted Key Generation Center (KGC) periodically
   broadcasts a set of key updates to all (non-revoked) users through
   public channels, where the size of key updates is only O(r log N/r),
   with N being the number of users and r the number of revoked users,
   respectively; however, every user needs to keep at least O(logN)
   long-term secret keys and all non-revoked users are required to
   communicate with the KGC regularly. These two drawbacks pose challenges
   to users who have limited resources to store their secret keys or cannot
   receive key updates in real-time.
   To alleviate the above problems, we propose a novel system model called
   server-aided revocable IBE. In our model, almost all of the workloads on
   users are delegated to an untrusted server which manages users' public
   keys and key updates sent by a KGC periodically. The server is untrusted
   in the sense that it does not possess any secret information. Our system
   model requires each user to keep just one short secret key and does not
   require users to communicate with either the KGC or the server during
   key updating. In addition, the system supports delegation of users'
   decryption keys, namely it is secure against decryption key exposure
   attacks. We present a concrete construction of the system that is
   provably secure against adaptive-ID chosen plaintext attacks under the
   DBDH assumption in the standard model. One application of our
   server-aided revocable IBE is encrypted email supporting lightweight
   devices (e.g., mobile phones) in which an email server plays the role of
   the untrusted server so that only non-revoked users can read their email
   messages.},

Abstract = {Individuals working in the Information Technology (IT) industry are
   familiar with Moore's Law and its guiding principle: exponential
   improvement every 18-24 months where computer technology is concerned
   (Brock, 2006). This principle has been proven generally accurate and is
   routinely used for long term planning by the computer industry, which
   has led to an explosion in computing power and technologies that have
   catapulted computing into every aspect of human's lives in the 21st
   century. However, while new technologies increase the quality of life
   for the current generation, they also provide avenues for nefarious
   individuals to take advantage of others using the same new technologies.
   To help counter this, the IT industry has made great strides in its
   efforts to protect users by developing security appliances to include
   firewalls, intrusion detection systems, encryption, passwords,
   two-factor authentication methods, and a layered approach to security;
   to name just a few. It is because of this effort by the IT industry to
   help protect users, the authors have identified unique cyber attack
   trends, that could be referred to as a new ``Moore's Law{''} (as it
   pertains to cyber security). As computer technologies become more
   sophisticated and robust, malicious actions have become less
   sophisticated, and in many instances, cyber exploitation and attacks
   occur without the use of technology. The authors have penned this
   concept as the ``Adam \& Eve Paradox{''}. The paradox construct being,
   as technologies improve and network perimeters are hardened preventing
   direct attacks against systems, users and systems are being exploited at
   an exponentially increased rate by methods contrary to the technological
   improvements. Cyber criminals and hackers will always first attempt
   attacks against the easiest targets, known as the low-hanging forbidden
   fruit described in the biblical Adam \& Eve story. While the IT industry
   continues to spend billions of dollars (US) annually to create
   appliances and develop software to protect its resources, data, and
   users; attackers are increasingly focusing their attention on the lowest
   hanging fruit, whether it be an unsuspecting user who clicks a link in
   an email, to a helpful administrator who provides information to a false
   authority. As the IT industry moves in the direction of complex
   defensive tactics, attackers are moving towards less complex - softer
   targets that are more difficult to detect, block, and mitigate. It is
   the authors' intention to define and substantiate the ``Adam \& Eve
   Paradox{''}.},

Abstract = {The prevalence of spam URLs in Internet services, such as email, social
   networks, blogs and online forums has become a serious problem. These
   spam URLs host spam advertisements, phishing attempts, and malwares,
   which are harmful for normal users. Existing URL blacklist approaches
   offer limited protection. Although recent machine learning based URL
   classification approaches demonstrate good accuracy and reasonable
   throughput, they are based on observations from existing spam URLs and
   hard to detect new spam URLs when attackers employ new strategies.
   In this paper, we present CUD (Crowdsourcing for URL spam detection) as
   a supplement of existing detection tools. CUD leverages human
   intelligence for URL classification through crowdsourcing. CUD crawls
   existing user comments about spam URLs already on the Internet, and
   employs sentiment analysis from nature language processing to analyze
   the user comments automatically for detecting spam URLs. Since CUD does
   not using features directly associated with the URLs and their landing
   pages, it is more robust when attackers change their strategies. Through
   evaluation, we find up to 70\% of URLs have user comments online. CUD
   achieves an accuracy of 86.8\% in terms of true positive rate with a
   false positive rate 0.9\%. Moreover, about 75\% of spam URLs CUD detects
   are missed by other approaches. Therefore, CUD can be used as a good
   complement to other approaches.},

Title = {Design of double-cross-based smartphone unlock mechanism},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {129},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Due to the advanced features, smartphones have become an essential and
   widely adopted electronic device around the world, which can provide
   various benefits, such as online shopping, e-commerce payment, making
   friends via social media, email checking and more. Such devices make
   people's work and life more convenient and flexible, but how to secure
   the locally stored phone data is a big problem. With more sensitive or
   private data stored on these portable devices, there is a significant
   demand to safeguard smartphones from unauthorized access. Currently, one
   of the most straightforward and intuitive approaches is to implement an
   unlock mechanism that asks users to input a correct unlock pattern for
   authentication, e.g., Android unlock patterns. However, such unlock
   mechanism can be easily compromised when the unlock pattern is leaked.
   In this work, we advocate that combining behavioral features with unlock
   mechanisms is a promising solution, and propose a double-cross-based
   unlock scheme, called Double-X, which requires users to unlock the
   device by inputting two cross shapes on the selected dots. For
   authentication, users have to re-input the selected dots and draw the
   cross shapes. In the evaluation, we conduct two user studies with 100
   participants in total to explore and validate the scheme performance, as
   compared with two similar unlock schemes. The experimental results
   indicate that under our scheme, users can reach good success rates with
   better feedback.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {As in other sectors, in the teaching / learning process there is a need
   to keep user accounts protected and access to different services of the
   university community: email, cloud repositories where the teacher stores
   the work material and exams and the students their work, a list of all
   the students, the training platforms, service to record the evaluations
   result, personal data of the worker and student, etc. The way to achieve
   this security in those online services is by identifying or validating
   the identity of the user through different methods. Currently, it is
   well known that a single method is not efficient enough and a second
   authentication factor must be used, either in software or hardware
   format. The paper presents a study with different proposals for a second
   authentication factor, analyzing advantages and disadvantages of each of
   them.},

Abstract = {Online shopping allows consumers to buy goods or services over the
   Internet. As the popularity of online shopping increases, Debit or
   Credit card fraud and personal information security are major concerns
   for customers, merchants, and banks. Identity theft and phishing are the
   common dangers of online shopping. In phishing process, suppose cheater
   sends out thousands of phishing emails with a link to the fake website.
   Victims click on links in email believing it is legitimate. They enter
   personal information on that fake website. Fraudsters use this
   information to login to the original website. This paper proposes a new
   scheme of detecting and preventing phishing sites. It is done using
   extended visual cryptography, steganography and android application. It
   reduces user interaction by auto-upload of shares and QR code details
   during authentication and this adds to security by reducing errors due

Title = {Simulating Social Pressure: Evaluating Risk Behaviors in Construction
   Using Augmented Virtuality},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {31},

Abstract = {Drawing on social influence and behavioral intention theories,
   coworkers' risk-taking serves as an ``extra motive{''} -an exogenous
   factor-for risk-taking behaviors among workers in the workplace. Social
   influence theories have shown that social factors, such as social
   pressure and coworker risk-taking, may predict risk-taking behaviors and
   significantly affect decision-making. While immersive technologies have
   been widely used to create close-to-real simulations for construction
   safety-related studies, there is a paucity of research considering the
   impact of social presence in evaluating workers' risk decision-making
   within immersive environments. To bridge this gap, this study developed
   a state-of-the-art Augmented Virtuality (AV) environment to investigate
   roofers' risk-taking behaviors when exposed to social stressors (working
   alongside a safe/unsafe peer). In this augmented virtuality environment,
   a virtual peer with safe and unsafe behaviors was simulated in order to
   impose peer pressure and increase participants' sense of social
   presence. Participants were asked to install asphalt shingles on a
   physical section of a roof (passive haptics) while the rest of the
   environment was projected virtually. During shingle installation,
   participants' cognitive and behavioral responses were captured using
   psychophysiological wearable technologies and self-report measures. The
   results demonstrated that the developed AV model could successfully
   enhance participants' sense of presence and social presence while
   serving as an appropriate platform for assessing individuals'
   decision-making orientations and behavioral changes in the presence of
   social stressors. Such information shows the value of immersive
   technologies to examine the naturalistic responses of individuals
   without exposing them to actual risks.},

Title = {Safe Reinforcement Learning-Based Eco-Driving Control for Mixed Traffic
   Flows With Disturbances},

Abstract = {This paper presents a safe learning-based eco-driving framework tailored
   for mixed traffic flows, which aims to optimize energy efficiency while
   guaranteeing system constraints during real-system operations. Even
   though reinforcement learning (RL) is capable of optimizing energy
   efficiency in intricate environments, it is challenged by safety
   requirements during both the training and deployment stages. The lack of
   safety guarantees impedes the application of RL to real-world problems.
   Compared with RL, model predicted control (MPC) can handle constrained
   dynamics systems, ensuring safe driving. However, the major challenges
   lie in complicated eco-driving tasks and the presence of disturbances,
   which pose difficulties for MPC design and constraint satisfaction. To
   address these limitations, the proposed framework incorporates the
   tube-based enhanced MPC (RMPC) to ensure the safe execution of the RL
   policy under disturbances, thereby improving the control robustness. RL
   not only optimizes the energy efficiency of the connected and automated
   vehicle in mixed traffic but also handles more uncertain scenarios, in
   which the energy consumption of the human-driven vehicle and its diverse
   and stochastic driving behaviors are considered in the optimization
   framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
   achieves an average improvement of 10.88\% in holistic energy efficiency
   compared to the RMPC technique, while effectively preventing
   inter-vehicle collisions when compared to the RL algorithm.},

Abstract = {Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) has attracted
   significant attention due to its fine-grained access control
   capabilities, which are highly compatible with cloud computing. Most
   enterprises utilizing cloud storage technology consist of multiple user
   groups. However, the current multigroup CP-ABE scheme may pose a risk of
   sensitive information leakage due to the plaintext access policy
   mechanisms. To mitigate this issue, it is necessary to conceal access
   policies. In this article, we propose a flexible policy-hidden
   multigroup attribute-based encryption (PH-MG-ABE) scheme that enables
   unique multigroup operations, such as group merging and splitting
   without affecting user keys. Each attribute in the access policy is
   divided into attribute values and attribute names. The proposed scheme
   achieves partial policy hiding by concealing the attribute values. Our
   scheme allows to directly revoke and join arbitrary numbers of users. In
   order to reduce the local decryption burden for users, the heavy
   decryption tasks are outsourced to cloud servers and correctness of the
   outsourced decryption is verifiable. We prove that our scheme is
   indistinguishable against under chosen plaintext attacks secure
   (IND-CPA) based on the decisional q-bilinear Diffie-Hellman exponent
   assumption. In addition, the proposed scheme appears to be efficient
   through the performance evaluation.},

Abstract = {When interacting with computers or digital artifacts, individuals tend
   to replicate interpersonal trust and distrust mechanisms to calibrate
   their trust. Such mechanisms involve cognitive processes that
   individuals rely on before making a decision to trust or distrust. With
   the worldwide increase in email traffic, both the academic literature
   and professionals warn of insider threats, that is, coming from inside
   an organization, in particular those created by legitimate users who
   have decided to trust a phishing email. This article offers a cognitive
   approach to the decision whether to trust a phishing email. After
   reviewing the literature on decision making concerning a cognitive
   perspective, interpretation, trust, distrust, online deception, and
   insider threats, we present a study conducted on 249 participants
   designed to ascertain how they interpreted phishing emails and decided
   whether or not to trust them. We noted that certain elements eliciting
   trust or distrust remained invariable regardless of the participant. We
   show examples of phishing emails designed to maximize (or minimize) the
   decision to trust (or distrust), and lastly consider the limitations and
   ethical questions raised by this research.},

Abstract = {End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) plays an essential role in safeguarding
   user privacy and protecting sensitive data across various communication
   platforms, including messaging applications, email services, and
   Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This paper presents a Hybrid
   Cryptography-Based E2EE method implemented on a Software Defined
   Networking (SDN) infrastructure, to strengthen bidirectional data
   security between hosts and IoT devices via the non-secure Message
   Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) port. By addressing the threat of
   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, the proposed system ensures that only
   authorized users can decrypt transmitted messages. This paper thoroughly
   analyzes the implementation and advantages of our Hybrid
   Cryptography-Based E2EE method by comparing RSA and ECC encryption
   techniques. ECC-256 is favored for key generation, owing to its high
   efficiency and speed, measured at 0.4009 ms. Additionally, through a
   comparison of RSA, AES, and ChaCha20 algorithms, AES-256 emerges as the
   optimal encryption choice, demonstrating the fastest encryption and
   decryption times for publishing 0.2758 ms and 0.1781 ms, respectively
   and for subscribing, with encryption at 0.2542 ms and decryption at
   0.1577 ms. Along with its minimal packet size and low resource
   consumption, our proposed Hybrid Cryptography-Based E2EE method,
   implemented on SDN infrastructure, validate it's effectiveness in
   securing digital communications within SDN environments compared to
   existing solutions.},

Title = {Use and Acceptance of Digital Communication Technology by Older Adults
   for Social Connectedness During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Mixed Methods
   Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Month = {AUG 2},
Abstract = {Background: Older adults are at higher risk for health issues, including
   mental health problems. This was especially apparent during the COVID-19
   pandemic, where older adults were simultaneously more vulnerable to the
   disease and the mental health concerns created by social distancing.
   Subsequently, the use of digital communication technology (DCT) became a
   critical option for maintaining social connectedness in older adults.
   Prior to the pandemic, the low uptake and use of technology by older
   adults was an established problem, known as the digital divide. However,
   not much is known about how this may have changed as a result of the
   pandemic.
   Objective: This study aims to explore how older adults maintained social
   connectedness through DCT during the pandemic and to understand factors
   influencing the use and acceptance of DCT.
   Methods: A mixed methods explorative field study was set up, involving
   surveys and interviews of 25 community-dwelling older adults (65-88
   years old) living in the United Kingdom. The surveys included the
   internet acceptance questionnaire (based on the Technology Acceptance
   Model {[}TAM]); COVID-19 dysfunctional anxiety was captured using the
   COVID-19 Anxiety Scale (CAS). Background information (demographics, use
   of technology) was gathered before conducting semistructured interviews.
   We hypothesized that CAS would affect constructs of TAM and that
   predictive constructs of TAM would have remained valid during the
   pandemic. We also posited that there would be unidentified themes
   outside TAM that impacted the acceptance and use of DCT. We used the
   quantitative data to guide the semistructured interviews, which were
   then analyzed through thematic analysis to identify additional themes.
   Results: Correlational analysis showed that CAS influences all
   constructs of TAM. We also saw that the predictive constructs of TAM,
   especially the perceived ease of use (PEU) and perceived usefulness
   (PU), remained valid during the pandemic. Common acceptance-influencing
   themes were encountered in both quantitative and qualitative analyses,
   with 3 matching the known constructs of TAM (PU, PEU, and behavioral
   intention). We identified 2 additional themes affecting acceptance,
   namely influence of the pandemic (situational context) and privacy and
   security concerns. DCT use (especially email and videoconferencing use)
   increased during the pandemic, but the results related to social
   networking sites were mixed.
   Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted technology acceptance and
   use by older adults, encouraging their use of certain DCT apps (email
   and videoconferencing apps, such as WhatsApp). These apps helped
   insulate them from adverse effects (social isolation and loneliness).
   Other social networking apps, however, exerted a negative influence,
   increasing anxiety and a general feeling of negativity. Future studies
   should maximize older adult agency related to design, privacy, security,
   and user requirements for development. We also recommend that when
   studying DCT acceptance for older adults, our additional identified
   themes should be considered alongside the existing TAM constructs.},

Abstract = {We develop a software system Text Scanner for Emotional Distress (TSED)
   for helping to detect email messages which are suspicious of coming from
   people under strong emotional distress. It has been confirmed by
   multiple studies that terrorist attackers have experienced a substantial
   emotional distress at some points before committing a terrorist attack.
   Therefore, if an individual in emotional distress can be detected on the
   basis of email texts, some preventive measures can be taken. The
   proposed detection machinery is based on extraction and classification
   of emotional profiles from emails.
   An emotional profile is a formal representation of a sequence of
   emotional states through a textual discourse where communicative actions
   are attached to these emotional states. The issues of extraction of
   emotional profiles from text and reasoning about it are discussed and
   illustrated. We then develop an inductive machine learning and reasoning
   framework to relate an emotional profile to the class ``Emotional
   distress{''} or ``No emotional distress{''}, given a training dataset
   where the class is assigned by an expert. TSED's machine learning is
   evaluated using the database of structured customer complaints.},

Abstract = {Many Internet of Things devices have voice user interfaces. One of the
   most popular voice user interfaces is Amazon's Alexa, which supports
   more than 50,000 third-party applications ({''}skills{''}). We study how
   Alexa's integration of these skills may confuse users. Our survey of 237
   participants found that users do not understand that skills are often
   operated by third parties, that they often confuse third-party skills
   with native Alexa functions, and that they are unaware of the functions
   that the native Alexa system supports. Surprisingly, users who interact
   with Alexa more frequently are more likely to conclude that a
   third-party skill is a native Alexa function. The potential for
   misunderstanding creates new security and privacy risks: attackers can
   develop third-party skills that operate without users' knowledge or
   masquerade as native Alexa functions. To mitigate this threat, wemake
   design recommendations to help users better distinguish native
   functionality and third-party skills, including audio and visual
   indicators of native and third-party contexts, as well as a consistent
   design standard to help users learn what functions are and are not
   possible on Alexa.},

Abstract = {In today's digital world, SMS phishing, also known as SMiShing, poses a
   serious threat to mobile users. However, it is unclear whether existing
   research on phishing can be applied to SMiShing. Our study aims to fill
   this gap by conducting interviews with 29 mobile phone users in a major
   southeastern U.S. city. We collected data on participants' experiences
   with suspicious SMS, understanding the cues they pay attention to, how
   they verify and report such messages, and the role of prior training in
   distinguishing real messages from scams. We also collected data on how
   specific details and context make a legitimate SMS seem genuine. Our
   findings indicate that participants focus more on the content, format,
   and links in SMS rather than the sender's short code, phone number, or
   email address. We suggest design changes to enhance user awareness and
   resilience against SMS phishing. This research provides practical
   knowledge to mitigate cyber threats linked to SMiShing. To the best of
   our knowledge, this is the first interview study on SMiShing
   susceptibility.},

Abstract = {A computer vision (CV) method to automatically measure the revised NIOSH
   lifting equation asymmetry angle (A) from a single camera is described
   and tested. A laboratory study involving ten participants performing
   various lifts was used to estimate A in comparison to ground truth joint
   coordinates obtained using 3-D motion capture (MoCap). To address
   challenges, such as obstructed views and limitations in camera placement
   in real-world scenarios, the CV method utilized video-derived
   coordinates from a selected set of landmarks. A 2-D pose estimator
   (HR-Net) detected landmark coordinates in each video frame, and a 3-D
   algorithm (VideoPose3D) estimated the depth of each 2-D landmark by
   analyzing its trajectories. The mean absolute precision error for the CV
   method, compared to MoCap measurements using the same subset of
   landmarks for estimating A, was 6.25 degrees (SD = 10.19 degrees, N =
   360). The mean absolute accuracy error of the CV method, compared
   against conventional MoCap landmark markers was 9.45 degrees (SD = 14.01
   degrees, N = 360).},

Title = {Efficient Dynamic Phishing Safeguard System Using Neural Boost Phishing
   Protection},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The instances of privacy and security have reached the point where they
   cannot be ignored. There has been a rise in data breaches and fraud,
   particularly in banks, healthcare, and government sectors. In today's
   world, many organizations offer their security specialists bug report
   programs that help them find flaws in their applications. The breach of
   data on its own does not necessarily constitute a threat or attack.
   Cyber-attacks allow cyberpunks to gain access to machines and networks
   and steal financial data and esoteric information as a result of a data
   breach. In this context, this paper proposes an innovative approach to
   help users to avoid online subterfuge by implementing a Dynamic Phishing
   Safeguard System (DPSS) using neural boost phishing protection algorithm
   that focuses on phishing, fraud, and optimizes the problem of data
   breaches. Dynamic phishing safeguard utilizes 30 different features to
   predict whether or not a website is a phishing website. In addition, the
   neural boost phishing protection algorithm uses an Anti-Phishing Neural
   Algorithm (APNA) and an Anti-Phishing Boosting Algorithm (APBA) to
   generate output that is mapped to various other components, such as IP
   finder, geolocation, and location mapper, in order to pinpoint the
   location of vulnerable sites that the user can view, which makes the
   system more secure. The system also offers a website blocker, and a
   tracker auditor to give the user the authority to control the system.
   Based on the results, the anti-phishing neural algorithm achieved an
   accuracy level of 97.10\%, while the anti-phishing boosting algorithm
   yielded 97.82\%. According to the evaluation results, dynamic phishing
   safeguard systems tend to perform better than other models in terms of
   uniform resource locator detection and security.},

Abstract = {The proliferation of online social networking services has aroused
   privacy concerns among the general public. The focus of such concerns
   has typically revolved around providing explicit privacy guarantees to
   users and letting users take control of the privacy-threatening aspects
   of their online behavior, so as to ensure that private personal
   information and materials are not made available to other parties and
   not used for unintended purposes without the user's consent. As such
   protective features are usually opt-in, users have to explicitly opt-in
   for them in order to avoid compromising their privacy. Besides,
   third-party applications may acquire a user's personal information, but
   only after they have been granted consent by the user. If we also
   consider potential network security attacks that intercept or misdirect
   a user's online communication, it would appear that the discussion of
   user vulnerability has accurately delimited the ways in which a user may
   be exposed to privacy threats.
   In this paper, we expose and discuss a previously unconsidered avenue by
   which a user's privacy can be gravely exposed. Using this exploit, we
   were able to gain complete access to some popular online social network
   accounts without using any conventional method like phishing, brute
   force, or trojans. Our attack merely involves a legitimate exploitation
   of the vulnerability created by the existence of obsolete web-based
   email addresses. We present the results of an experimental study on the
   spread that such an attack can reach, and the ethical dilemmas we faced
   in the process. Last, we outline our suggestions for defense mechanisms
   that can be employed to enhance online security and thwart the kind of
   attacks that we expose.},

Abstract = {Phishing scams have increased drastically over the years. Prior research
   has investigated various ways to prevent phishing email scams. However,
   little is known about human decisions against phishing emails that
   contain cognitive biases and are either crafted by humans or
   large-language models (LLMs). Also, less is known about how humans can
   be trained against such emails. This research aimed to address this
   literature gap by investigating the effectiveness of human-crafted
   phishing emails versus GPT-3 crafted phishing emails (GPT-3 being an
   LLM). The study consisted of two between-subjects conditions (N = 30 per
   condition): human and GPT. Each condition contained three rounds with a
   total of 40 trials, and participants were required to mark the degree to
   which the presented email was genuine or phishing in each trial. The
   second round provided feedback to participants in both conditions. The
   results showed that human-crafted emails were more effective in phishing
   people compared to GPT-3 crafted emails even after training across
   different cognitive biases. However, humans felt more confident against
   human-crafted emails compared to GPT-3 crafted emails. We highlight the
   implications of these results for LLM crafted phishing attacks compared
   to human-crafted phishing attacks.},

Abstract = {In 1995, Vanstone and Zuccherato proposed a novel method of generating
   RSA moduli having a predetermined set of bits which are the ASCII
   representation of user's identification information (i.e., name, email
   address, etc.). This could lead to a savings in bandwidth for data
   transmission and storage. In this paper, we apply this idea of Vanstone
   and Zuccherato for reducing the storage requirement of RSA public moduli
   to integer factoring based public-key schemes with their moduli of the
   form p(r)q. More precisely, we explicitly propose two efficient methods
   for specifying high-order bits of prime factors of their public-keys. We
   also consider the security of the proposed methods.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, a typical household owns multiple digital devices that can be
   connected to the Internet. Advertising companies always want to
   seamlessly reach consumers behind devices instead of the device itself.
   However, the identity of consumers becomes fragmented as they switch
   from one device to another. A naive attempt is to use deterministic
   features such as user name, telephone number and email address. However
   consumers might refrain from giving away their personal information
   because of privacy and security reasons. The challenge in ICDM2015
   contest is to develop an accurate probabilistic model for predicting
   cross-device consumer identity without using the deterministic user
   information.
   In this paper we present an accurate and scalable cross-device solution
   using an ensemble of Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) and Random
   Forest. Our final solution ranks 9 th both on the public and private LB
   with F0.5 score of 0.855.},

Abstract = {As one of the most successful recommendation techniques,
   neighborhood-based collaborative filtering (CF), which recommends
   appropriate items to a target user by identifying similar users or
   similar items, has been widely applied to various recommender systems.
   Although many neighbor-based CF methods have been put forward, there are
   still some open issues that have remained unsolved. First, the
   ever-increasing volume of user-item rating data decreases the
   recommendation efficiency significantly as a recommender system needs to
   analyze all the rating data when searching for similar neighbors or
   similar items. In this situation, users' requirements on quick response
   may not be met. Second, in neighbor-based CF methods, more attention is
   paid to the recommendation accuracy while other key indicators of
   recommendation performances are often ignored, i.e., recommendation
   diversity (RD), which probably produces similar or redundant items in
   the recommended list and decreases users' satisfaction. Considering
   these issues, a diversified and scalable recommendation method (called
   DR\_LT) based on locality-sensitive hashing and cover tree is proposed
   in this article, where the item topic information is used to optimize
   the final recommended list. We show the effectiveness of our proposed
   method through a set of experiments on MovieLens data set that clearly
   shows the feasibility of our proposal in terms of item recommendation
   accuracy, diversity, and scalability.},

Title = {Patients' and Clinicians' Visions of a Future Internet-of-Things System
   to Support Asthma Self-Management: Mixed Methods Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Background: Supported self-management for asthma reduces acute attacks
   and improves control. The internet of things could connect patients to
   health care providers, community services, and their living environments
   to provide overarching support for self-management.
   Objective: We aimed to identify patients' and clinicians' preferences
   for a future internet-of-things system and explore their visions of its
   potential to support holistic self-management.
   Methods: In an exploratory sequential mixed methods study, we recruited
   patients from volunteer databases and charities' social media. We
   purposively sampled participants to interview them about their vision of
   the design and utility of the internet of things as a future strategy
   for supporting self-management. Respondents who were not invited to
   participate in the interviews were invited to complete a web-based
   questionnaire to prioritize the features suggested by the interviewees.
   Clinicians were recruited from professional networks. Interviews were
   transcribed and analyzed thematically using PRISMS self-management
   taxonomy.
   Results: We interviewed 12 patients and 12 clinicians in the United
   Kingdom, and 140 patients completed the web-based questionnaires.
   Patients expressed mostly wanting a system to log their asthma control
   status automatically; provide real-time advice to help them learn about
   their asthma, identify and avoid triggers, and adjust their treatment.
   Peak flow (33/140, 23.6\%), environmental (pollen, humidity, air
   temperature) (33/140, 23.6\%), and asthma symptoms (25/140, 17.9\%) were
   the specific data types that patient most wanted. Information about
   asthma and text or email access to clinical advice provided a feeling of
   safety for patients. Clinicians wanted automated objective data about
   the patients' condition that they could access during consultations. The
   potential reduction in face-to-face consultations was appreciated by
   clinicians which they perceived could potentially save patients' travel
   time and health service resources. Lifestyle logs of fitness regimes or
   weight control were valued by some patients but were of less interest to
   clinicians.
   Conclusions: An automated internet-of-things system that requires
   minimal input from the user and provides timely advice in line with an
   asthma action plan agreed by the patient with their clinician was
   preferred by most respondents. Links to asthma information and the
   ability to connect with clinicians by text or email were perceived by
   patients as features that would provide a sense of safety. Further
   studies are needed to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of
   internet-of-things systems in routine clinical practice.},

Abstract = {Objectives: Care for older adults with cancer became more challenging
   during the COVID-1 9 pandemic. We sought to examine healthcare
   providers' clinical barriers, patient questions, and overall experiences
   related to care delivery for these patients during the pandemic.
   Materials and methods: Members of the Advocacy Committee of the Cancer
   and Aging Research Group along with the Association of Community Cancer
   Centers developed a 20-question survey for healthcare providers of older
   adults with cancer. Eligible participants were recruited by email sent
   through professional organizations' listservs, email blasts, and social
   media. This manuscript reports the qualitative data from the survey's
   three open-ended questions. Free text, open-ended survey items were
   analyzed by two independent coders for identification of common themes
   using NVivo software. Theme agreement was reached through consensus and
   count comparisons of participant responses were made.
   Results: Healthcare system organizational challenges and meeting basic
   needs and support were commonly reported themes among respondents (n =
   274). Barriers to care delivery included organizational challenges,
   patients' access to resources and support, concerns for patients' mental
   and physical health, and telehealth challenges. Respondents reported
   older adults were asking about their health and cancer care as well as
   access to basic needs and supports. Providers described worrying about
   patients' mental health, fear of personal safety, frustration in
   multi-level institutions, as well as experiencing positive leadership
   and communication.
   Conclusion: Providers are faced with balancing their concerns for
   personal and patient safety. These findings demand resources and support
   allocation for older adults with cancer and healthcare providers during
   the COVID19 pandemic.

Abstract = {Apple's offline file-sharing service AirDrop is integrated into more
   than 1.5 billion end-user devices worldwide. We discovered two design
   flaws in the underlying protocol that allow attackers to learn the phone
   numbers and email addresses of both sender and receiver devices. As a
   remediation, we study the applicability of private set intersection
   (PSI) to mutual authentication, which is similar to contact discovery in
   mobile messengers. We propose a novel optimized PSI-based protocol
   called PrivateDrop that addresses the specific challenges of offline
   resource-constrained operation and integrates seamlessly into the
   current AirDrop protocol stack. Using our native PrivateDrop
   implementation for iOS and macOS, we experimentally demonstrate that
   PrivateDrop preserves AirDrop's exemplary user experience with an
   authentication delay well below one second. We responsibly disclosed our
   findings to Apple and open-sourced our PrivateDrop implementation.},

Abstract = {Messaging app developers are beginning to take the security and privacy
   of their users' communication more seriously. Unfortunately, a recent
   study has shown that the developers of many popular apps incorrectly use
   cryptography. As a result, they make mistakes that may result in
   trivially broken encryption schemes. For example, the developers of
   Snapchat use a constant symmetric encryption key hardcoded into the app
   and it only takes 12 lines of Ruby to crack the encryption.
   In this work, we propose ZIPR (Zero-Interaction PRivacy), a system that
   relieves developers from the task of using cryptography correctly.
   Designed for text-messaging apps, ZIPR automatically negotiates shared
   secret keys, and encrypts and decrypts messages as users of these apps
   chat with each other. No manual intervention is required by users for
   them to enjoy secure messaging.
   There are two key ideas behind ZIPR. First, most text-messaging apps
   follow a basic UI scheme that contains (i) a text box for users to
   compose their message, (ii) a ``send{''} button which they click on to
   send the message, and (iii) a list view to display sent and received
   messages. By intercepting events on these UI elements, ZIPR can
   manipulate the composed message before it is sent and before it is
   displayed. This allows the system to transparently encrypt and decrypt
   message data.
   The second key idea is that ZIPR can reuse the communication channel
   defined by an app to negotiate a shared secret key between two users.
   This is done by piggy-backing negotiation data on the messages users
   send to each other. A major advantage of this approach is that ZIPR can
   avoid the difficult task of establishing user identities. After all, a
   user of a text-messaging app is likely to carry out a conversation only
   with someone she knows, and both of them would have signed up for the
   chat service using some personal data such as their email addresses or
   phone numbers.
   Developers use ZIPR by tagging UI elements; no changes to their source
   code are required. This is similar to HTTPS where web developers only
   need to configure their servers with SSL certificates to encrypt data
   transmission with their users. However, unlike HTTPS, the end-to-end
   encryption in ZIPR takes place between the two users carrying out a
   conversation and not between a server and a user. This ensures that even
   if the app servers are compromised, users' messages would remain secure.
   ZIPR is implemented in Android 4.3 and works with existing apps with
   very few modifications. In this demo, we show that our current prototype
   works with several apps including Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, and
   Skype. These apps required only four, five, and three lines of
   modification to their UI XML definition files, respectively.
   In Figure 1, we show a screenshot of Whatsapp running under ZIPR. In the
   first two messages exchanged between the users, a new shared secret key
   is negotiated. Subsequently, all following messages are securely
   transmitted, and these encrypted messages are prefixed with a ``{*}'' by
   ZIPR.
   We are currently extending our prototype to use the Android Keystore API
   and the TrustZone hardware to allow users to identify MitM attacks, and
   to store the secret keys securely. We are also porting other messaging
   apps, such as Viber, to ZIPR.},

Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2020},

Month = {SEP 7},
Abstract = {BackgroundIntimate Partner Violence is a ``global pandemic{''}.
   Meanwhile, information and communication technologies (ICT), such as the
   internet, mobile phones, and smartphones, are spreading worldwide,
   including in low- and middle-income countries. We reviewed the available
   evidence on the use of ICT-based interventions to address intimate
   partner violence (IPV), evaluating the effectiveness, acceptability, and
   suitability of ICT for addressing different aspects of the problem
   (e.g., awareness, screening, prevention, treatment, mental
   health).MethodsWe conducted a systematic review, following PRISMA
   guidelines, using the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of
   Science. Key search terms included women, violence, domestic violence,
   intimate partner violence, information, communication technology, ICT,
   technology, email, mobile, phone, digital, ehealth, web, computer,
   online, and computerized. Only articles written in English were
   included.ResultsTwenty-five studies addressing screening and disclosure,
   IPV prevention, ICT suitability, support and women's mental health were
   identified. The evidence reviewed suggests that ICT-based interventions
   were effective mainly in screening, disclosure, and prevention. However,
   there is a lack of homogeneity among the studies' outcome measurements
   and the sample sizes, the control groups used (if any), the type of
   interventions, and the study recruitment space. Questions addressing
   safety, equity, and the unintended consequences of the use of ICT in IPV
   programming are virtually non-existent.ConclusionsThere is a clear need
   to develop women-centered ICT design when programming for IPV. Our study
   showed only one study that formally addressed software usability. The
   need for more research to address safety, equity, and the unintended
   consequences of the use of ICT in IPV programming is paramount. Studies
   addressing long term effects are also needed.},

Abstract = {The topic of spam filtering has been thoroughly studied by researchers
   in the past few decades. There has been successful works with high spam
   detection rates, yet no paper has described a method which can
   effectively detect spam and, at the same time, measure the importance of
   ham emails. In this paper, the authors propose a method of generating
   SpamAssassin rules which can indicate the degree of importance of an
   email message. Specifically we added a proportion of negatively weighted
   ham rules and adapted HPSOWM, an efficient evolutionary algorithm, to
   optimize SpamAssassin rule scores. As a result, using our new rule set,
   SpamAssassin is able to give indicative scores for both spam and ham.
   These scores can be utilized by email clients to categorize incoming
   messages based on their importance to user. Various experiments were
   conducted to evaluate our method. In addition, a conclusion was drawn
   about the best ratio of spam rules and ham rules.},

Abstract = {The study of online social networks has attracted increasing interest.
   However, concerns are raised for the privacy risks of user data since
   they have been frequently shared among researchers, advertisers, and
   application developers. To solve this problem, a number of anonymization
   algorithms have been recently developed for protecting the privacy of
   social graphs. In this article, we proposed a graph node similarity
   measurement in consideration with both graph structure and descriptive
   information, and a deanonymization algorithm based on the measurement.
   Using the proposed algorithm, we evaluated the privacy risks of several
   typical anonymization algorithms on social graphs with thousands of
   nodes from Microsoft Academic Search, LiveJournal, and the Enron email
   dataset, and a social graph with millions of nodes from Tencent Weibo.
   Our results showed that the proposed algorithm was efficient and
   effective to deanonymize social graphs without any initial seed
   mappings. Based on the experiments, we also pointed out suggestions on
   how to better maintain the data utility while preserving privacy.},

Abstract = {Now a day's cloud computing is used in many areas like industry,
   military colleges etc to storing huge amount of data. We can retrieve
   data from cloud on request of user. To store data on cloud we have to
   face many issues. To provide the solution to these issues there are n
   number of ways. Cryptography and steganography techniques are more
   popular now a day's for data security. Use of a single algorithm is not
   effective for high level security to data in cloud computing. In this
   paper we have introduced new security mechanism using symmetric key
   cryptography algorithm and steganography. In this proposed system AES,
   blowfish, RC6 and BRA algorithms are used to provide block wise security
   to data. All algorithm key size is 128 bit. LSB steganography technique
   is introduced for key information security. Key information contains
   which part of file is encrypted using by which algorithm and key. File
   is splited into eight parts. Each and every part of file is encrypted
   using different algorithm. All parts of file are encrypted
   simultaneously with the help of multithreading technique. Data
   encryption Keys are inserted into cover image using LSB technique. Stego
   image is send to valid receiver using email. For file decryption purpose
   reverse process of encryption is applied.},

Abstract = {This work-in-progress paper investigates the problem of assessing and
   detecting if a text was written by a human or if it was generated by a
   language model. In our case study, we focused on email messages. For the
   purpose of experiments, we used a combination of publicly available
   email datasets with our in-house data, containing in total over 10k
   emails. Then, we generated their ``copies{''} using large language
   models (LLMs) with specific prompts. We experimented with various
   classifiers and feature spaces. We achieved encouraging results, with
   the F1-scores of almost 0.99 for email messages in English and over 0.92
   for the ones in Polish, using Random Forest as a classifier. We found
   that the detection model relied strongly on typographic and orthographic
   (spelling) imperfections of the analyzed emails and on statistics of
   sentence lengths. We also observed the inferior results obtained for
   Polish, highlighting a need for research in the direction of languages
   underrepresented in training models.},

Title = {Slocum Gliders Provide Accurate Near Real-Time Estimates of Baleen Whale
   Presence From Human-Reviewed Passive Acoustic Detection Information},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Month = {FEB 25},
Abstract = {Mitigating the effects of human activities on marine mammals often
   depends on monitoring animal occurrence over long time scales, large
   spatial scales, and in real time. Passive acoustics, particularly from
   autonomous vehicles, is a promising approach to meeting this need. We
   have previously developed the capability to record, detect, classify,
   and transmit to shore information about the tonal sounds of baleen
   whales in near real time from long-endurance ocean gliders. We have
   recently developed a protocol by which a human analyst reviews this
   information to determine the presence of marine mammals, and the results
   of this review are automatically posted to a publicly accessible
   website, sent directly to interested parties via email or text, and made
   available to stakeholders via a number of public and private digital
   applications. We evaluated the performance of this system during two
   3.75-month Slocum glider deployments in the southwestern Gulf of Maine
   during the spring seasons of 2015 and 2016. Near real-time detections of
   humpback, fin, sei, and North Atlantic right whales were compared to
   detections of these species from simultaneously recorded audio. Data
   from another 2016 glider deployment in the same area were also used to
   compare results between three different analysts to determine
   repeatability of results both among and within analysts. False detection
   (occurrence) rates on daily time scales were 0\% for all species. Daily
   missed detection rates ranged from 17 to 24\%. Agreement between two
   trained novice analysts and an experienced analyst was greater than 95\%
   for fin, sei, and right whales, while agreement was 83-89\% for humpback
   whales owing to the more subjective process for detecting this species.
   Our results indicate that the presence of baleen whales can be
   accurately determined using information about tonal sounds transmitted
   in near real-time from Slocum gliders. The system is being used
   operationally to monitor baleen whales in United States, Canadian, and
   Chilean waters, and has been particularly useful for monitoring the
   critically endangered North Atlantic right whale throughout the
   northwestern Atlantic Ocean.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a smart library management system based on the
   combination of RFID technology and the biometric recognition system to
   upgrade the performance of conventional library management. In
   particular, the proposed design combines a radio frequency
   identification (RFID) and Biometric technology to enhance
   user-processing time, improve user service, and curtail book theft, to
   ease updating of new books and further increase the biometric security
   of the system against an imposter. Using MySQL, the internet of things
   (IoT), and Java programming, we design a system that provides the user
   with unrestricted access to online library facilities with a personal
   computer or mobile devices. For improved efficiency, the proposed design
   integrated with SMS and an email alert notification system. The proposed
   design, thus allows the user to access books and course materials from a
   remote location in an authenticated and secured manner The system
   performance was compared to the manual method in terms of book
   positioning function, false rejection rate, false acceptance rate,
   counting efficiency, average time spent on booking searching and the
   results show that the proposed system outperforms the conventional
   (manual) library system.},

Abstract = {Android software development kits for cloud storage are commonly adopted
   by the app development community and countless apps from productivity
   tools to media-sharing platforms currently incorporate the kits. The
   popularity can be attributed to their ability to offer scalable and
   reliable cloud storage apps, reducing the need for on-device storage and
   ensuring data accessibility across devices. However, because the apps
   tend to store user information in the cloud, there are concerns about
   security risks and sensitive information leakage. This chapter presents
   the results of a forensic analysis of 11 major Android cloud software
   development kits and 120 real-world apps that leverage the kits for data
   storage. The analysis revealed that 103 apps store user account
   information, including name, email, date of birth and profile picture,
   77 apps access and store user media files and user preferences and
   settings in the cloud, and 12 apps track the last used times of other
   installed apps. Android software development kits for cloud storage are
   of great value in mobile device forensics because they support the
   extraction of diverse and novel types of evidence, including via uniform
   resource locators.},

Title = {Human factors in phishing: Understanding susceptibility and resilience},
Journal = {COMPUTER STANDARDS \& INTERFACES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {94},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This study examines the demographic and organizational factors
   influencing phishing susceptibility and incident reporting behaviors
   among employees in a large European financial organization following
   realistic phishing simulations and how these factors correlate with
   susceptibility to phishing attacks. In the phishing simulations campaign
   with 8,102 participants, unannounced, monthly phishing emails with
   different templates are sent during regular work hours over a duration
   of 2 years, and the reactions (clicking the link and reporting the
   phishing email) are collected. The results are combined with demographic
   and relevant organizational data such as age, gender, level of
   education, department type, tenure, and job level. Multivariate logistic
   regression models are developed to analyze the relationship between
   these variables and phishing behaviors. The analysis reveals significant
   differences in susceptibility to and resilience against phishing attacks
   across various demographic and organizational groups. Older employees
   are more susceptible to phishing, while males show lower vulnerability
   to phishing attacks. Additionally, our results revealed that
   higher-level employees often under report phishing emails. These
   findings highlight the necessity for targeted anti-phishing training
   tailored to different demographics and departments within the
   organization and the importance of fostering a culture of incident
   reporting. Recommendations include customized cyber awareness training
   programs, regular awareness sessions, and incentivizing reporting.
   Future research is encouraged to prioritize investigating the root
   causes of phishing behaviors and evaluating the effectiveness of
   training programs.},

   research is to discover at what extent security and privacy factors
   contribute to the adoption of e-commerce. This study has been designed
   to explore why online shopping is growing so fast among some users, and
   so slowly among others. 2051 questionnaires were distributed by using
   different media such as email and Internet to the subjects and received
   back only 21\% questionnaires from respondents. The result shows that
   all of the independent variables played important roles in determining
   the adoption of e-commerce and created a gap between users who are
   adopting e-commerce and those who have not. The finding also shows that
   there are two significant factors, making an impact on the adoption of
   e-commerce, which are the user's educational background and their
   understanding of security features implemented by the vendors.},

Abstract = {For an enterprise, it is important to handle sensitive customer data
   properly because any data breach or violation can lead to hefty
   penalties. Past work has looked at various techniques for detecting
   sensitive data in free-flowing text for a given regulation. However,
   most of them either produce many false positives or are very specific to
   certain types of data, for example, email, account number, or social
   security number. Moreover, machine learning-based methods are difficult
   to use as finding large amounts of labeled data for training a
   supervised model poses a serious challenge. In this work, we aim to
   address the issue of sensitive data discovery in a data-constrained
   environment by utilizing pre-trained models. We compare their
   effectiveness in the financial and health domains. Further, we improve
   the performance of pre-trained models by employing morphological-level
   features and propose a hybrid model architecture. Our experimental
   results show that pretrained models in a data-constrained environment
   can reduce the turnaround time for sensitive data discovery, thus saving
   money and effort.},

Abstract = {Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has been proposed recently to
   improve the efficiency of content delivery in current IP networks. ICN
   employs data names, instead of host addresses, as routing and forwarding
   indicators. Content in the ICN carries only signature of the content
   provider but does not contain the identity of the content consumer by
   default. Such information is, however, essential for many of the web
   applications, such as email, online social networking, online game,
   e-commerce, and other session-based web services.
   In this paper, we propose a session-based access control (SAC) mechanism
   for ICN scenario to bridge the gap. Key distribution protocols are
   designed to protect the confidentiality of the content during
   information delivery. We also employ a dynamic naming scheme to enhance
   user privacy. According to security analysis, our access control
   mechanism can provide communication security and privacy protection for
   both sides of the session. Our design can be easily applied to
   session-based applications in ICN with negligible overhead.},

Abstract = {The stock market is one of the best channels for financial development
   that requires a high accuracy prediction of the trades. This subject
   needs some technical skills and experience to achieve the best result.
   This paper represents a tuned Python console program based on the Neural
   Network (NN), and the Artificial Intelligence (AI) to predict future
   price in a qualified and quantized way with high accuracy and close to
   real. New ideas implemented in this paper are combining AI and NN model
   in the Python console system with a security shell that works with voice
   and PIN to authenticate the user. It has Cross-Platform capability and
   supports cryptocurrencies price and their predictions. This program
   enables the user to have a duplication of the final data in his/her
   given email. The proposed approach presents the influence of AI and
   Machine learning in nearly future predictions. This system can be used
   in the all kinds of subjects that include past time databases.},

Abstract = {In today's world, almost every individual uses computational machines
   for their day to day activities. Contribution of Cloud Computing in our
   day to day life is commendable. Even a common man has the privilege to
   use cloud services in the form of email, games, storage and etc.,
   because of Cloud Computing. Cloud services tend to be cheaper and
   affordable with pay as you use policy. Scalability and on demand service
   is an added advantage of cloud computing. With all its benefits and
   simplicity in usage, clouds have earned a huge number of customers.
   While the growth of cloud computing looks healthy, several issues like
   security, cloud outages and expenses compel an user to think and analyze
   before converting to cloud services. This paper discusses about the
   hidden costs incurred by using closed source cloud services and the
   advantages of using open source cloud platforms available in the market.},

Abstract = {Nowadays E-health clotid systems are more and more widely employed.
   However the security of these systems needs more consideration for the
   sensitive health information of patients. Some protocols on how to
   secure the e-health cloud system have been proposed, but many of them
   use the traditional PKI infrastructure to implement cryptographic
   mechanisms, which is cumbersome for they require every user having and
   remembering its own public/private keys. Identity based encryption (IBE)
   is a cryptographic primitive which uses the identity information of the
   user (e.g., email address) as the public key. Hence the public key is
   implicitly authenticated and the certificate management is simplified.
   Proxy re-encryption is another cryptographic primitive which aims at
   transforming a ciphertext under the delegator A into another ciphertext
   which can be decrypted by the delegatee B. In this paper, we describe
   several identity related cryptographic techniques for securing E-health
   system, which include new IBE schemes, new identity based proxy
   re-encryption (IBPRE) schemes. We also prove these schemes' security and
   give the performance analysis, the results show our IBPRE scheme is
   especially highly efficient for re-encryption, which can be used to
   achieve cost-effective cloud usage. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   the location of the vehicle and was able to issue an alert when the
   vehicle exited the geofence area. This system was separated into two
   parts which were the hardware and software. The hardware parts were the
   ESP8266 NodeMCU and GPS module while Google Maps and IoT platform were
   the software parts. The admin could monitor the vehicle via the
   computer, and the notification alert was sent to the registered email of
   the admin when the vehicle exited or entered the geofence area. The
   prototype system was tested by moving the vehicle around the geofence
   area. The results showed the correct location of the vehicle and email
   notification alert when it exited or entered the boundaries. The
   location accuracy of about 95\% compared to the real-map on the mobile

Title = {An Empirical Investigation of The Unintended Consequences of
   Vulnerability Assessments Leading to Betrayal},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {When cybersecurity units conduct vulnerability assessments to evaluate
   the security of organizations, they can have unintended consequences for
   employees. Although cybersecurity personnel may view tactics such as
   fake phishing attacks and email scanning as protective measures,
   employees may view them as threats because being singled out as a
   security risk can harm their standing in the organization. To understand
   the implications of vulnerability assessments, we examine how
   organizations' use of different tactics to identify user vulnerabilities
   can lead employees to feel betrayed by the cybersecurity unit, resulting
   in negative cybersecurity outcomes. Drawing on the theory of betrayal
   aversion, we develop a model that shows that when employees perceive
   these tactics as harmful, they can lead to an affective state of
   cybersecurity betrayal, resulting in a damaged relationship with the
   cybersecurity unit. In collaboration with an organization's
   cybersecurity unit, we evaluated our model using an experimental
   vignette survey, post hoc interviews, and a crosssectional survey with
   two samples (i.e., employees in the organization and employees from a
   panel). We found that when organizations conduct vulnerability
   assessments to enhance cybersecurity, they often induce an affective
   state of betrayal and increase employees' active resistance to
   cybersecurity (i.e., abandonment, avoidance, and sabotage of
   cybersecurity policies, technologies, and units). The paper concludes
   with implications for research and practice that explain the unintended
   consequences of vulnerability assessment and betrayal.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the accelerated advancement of Internet of Vehicles
   (IoV) technology has significantly enhanced user experiences by
   providing intelligent services, such as multimedia entertainment and
   autonomous driving in vehicles. However, the enforcement of regulations
   concerning vehicle violations in IoV environments predominantly relies
   on manual methods, which are both expensive and challenging. Moreover,
   the inherent constraints in existing surveillance systems result in
   regulatory blind spots. Consequently, it is imperative to develop
   intelligent IoV-based surveillance mechanisms to improve the efficiency
   of detecting and rectifying violations. In this article, we propose a
   blockchain-based self-supervision model for vehicle violations that
   utilizes intervehicle reporting and voting mechanisms to enhance the
   detection rate of violations and reduce regulatory pressure. A forensic
   blockchain is introduced in the model to enable a review of the
   reporting results, which improves the security and reliability of the
   system. Additionally, more vehicles are incentivized to participate in
   the system through reputation-based rewards, punishments, and
   incentives. The system was deployed on the Hyperledger Fabric platform.
   Simulation experiments were conducted using Veins, SUMO, and OMNeT++.
   The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the model. The
   reporting and voting mechanism significantly inhibit violations, and the
   reward and reputation mechanism effectively promote the participation of
   vehicles.},

Abstract = {Purpose The aim of this review was to build upon previous literature
   describing the maximum duration for which refrigerated medications can
   tolerate room temperature excursions while maintaining stability and
   potency. Methods During a 12-month period ending in June 2021, the
   prescribing information and published monographs from multiple pharmacy
   compendia were reviewed for all medications and biologic products
   approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for human use
   since January 2000. Products that were subsequently withdrawn from the
   US market were excluded. When temperature excursion data was unavailable
   in published form, product manufacturers were surveyed via telephone
   and/or email. Acceptable storage information for all products for which
   storage is recommended at temperatures below room temperature (20-25
   degrees C {[}68-77 degrees F]) was compiled and arranged in tabular
   format. Results Of the 705 products or formulations approved by FDA
   during the predefined time period, 246 were identified as requiring
   storage at temperatures below room temperature. After review of
   available prescribing information and manufacturer communications, if
   applicable, acceptable periods of excursion to temperatures at room
   temperature or higher were identified for 214 products (87\%).
   Conclusion Information related to acceptable periods of room temperature
   excursion was compiled for a total of 214 products approved for US
   distribution since 2000. The included tables may increase patient safety
   and decrease medication loss or related expenditures.},

Abstract = {Malwares are very precarious problem for Internet users. They are
   malicious software or programs, programmed by attackers to interrupt
   computer operation, gather delicate information, or gain access to
   client computer system ({[}1]). Key-logger is one of the massive threat
   among various malwares. It can be a hardware key-logger or software
   key-logger which records the keystrokes and store them in a log file and
   email that file to the attacker, if attacker wants to do so. It is
   baleful for system user or end users who use online banking rarely or
   ordinarily. In this paper, we propose a technique for prevention of
   password from a key-logger spywares and give assurance of security of
   password from key-logger spywares.},

Title = {It's not just about accuracy: An investigation of the human factors in
   users' reliance on anti-phishing tools},
Journal = {DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {163},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Phishing attacks pose substantial threats to the security of individuals
   and organizations. Although current anti-phishing tools achieve high
   accuracy rates and present a potential solution to this problem, users
   are often reluctant to rely on the predictions of these competent tools.
   However, we continue to lack a means of resolving this reluctance-or
   even an explanation for it. To address this need and advance toward a
   solution, we inves-tigate the factors that influence users' reliance on
   anti-phishing tools. Over the course of two studies, we test the effects
   of tool attributes (i.e., accuracy and frequency of phishing email
   predictions) and develop a model based on the notions of trust and
   distrust. Countering the common conjecture that tools are not accurate
   enough, we find that users' under-reliance is not an artifact of the
   insufficient accuracy of tools, as even in a 100\% accuracy condition,
   users were under-reliant on tools. Rather, we find that while accuracy
   increases users' trust in tools, full reliance is inhibited by users'
   distrust, which is driven by a lack of transparency regarding tools'
   function-alities and the quantity of predictions provided. Thus,
   overall, our study shows the limits of accuracy in engendering reliance
   and explains the under-reliance phenomenon by showing that due to lack
   of knowledge or understanding, some users prefer to rely on their own
   inferior judgment instead of trusting and relying on the predictions
   provided by highly accurate tools.},

Abstract = {Attackers increasingly use passwords leaked from one website to
   compromise associated accounts on other websites. Such targeted attacks
   work because users reuse, or pick similar, passwords for different
   websites. We recast one of the core technical challenges underlying
   targeted attacks as the task of modeling similarity of human-chosen
   passwords. We show how to learn good password similarity models using a
   compilation of 1.4 billion leaked email, password pairs.
   Using our trained models of password similarity, we exhibit the most
   damaging targeted attack to date. Simulations indicate that our attack
   compromises more than 16\% of user accounts in less than a thousand
   guesses, should one of their other passwords be known to the attacker
   and despite the use of state-of-the-art countermeasures. We show via a
   case study involving a large university authentication service that the
   attacks are also effective in practice. We go on to propose the
   first-ever defense against such targeted attacks, by way of personalized
   password strength meters (PPSMs). These are password strength meters
   that can warn users when they are picking passwords that are vulnerable
   to attacks, including targeted ones that take advantage of the user's
   previously compromised passwords. We design and build a PPSM that can be
   compressed to less than 3 MB, making it easy to deploy in order to
   accurately estimate the strength of a password against all known
   guessing attacks.},

Abstract = {Bots refer to automated software that have the capability to execute
   commands on receiving instructions from BotMaster. SocialBots are the
   bots present in Online Social Network (OSN) which mimic the activities
   of the real users. They have the capability to automatically perform the
   basic functionalities offered by the OSN platforms. These socialbots
   have widespread usage in political campaigning and product marketing,
   but SocialBots can also been used for the purpose of swaying voters,
   mounting political attacks, manipulating public opinion, etc. Apart from
   these, SocialBots posses various security risks, one of which is
   befriending an OSN user thereby gaining access to personal details such
   as birthday, email id, phone number, address, etc. Detection of these
   SocialBots is therefore an important problem to be solved in order to
   maintain the reputation of OSN. Our work concentrates on behavioral
   analysis of these SocialBots in the OSN and identifying features to be
   used to develop a model for detection of these Socialbots using machine
   learning. The model, thus developed, is further used as a background
   process to create a web-based tool for detection of SocialBots. In our
   work, we created a SocialBot to perform behavioral analysis. This
   SocialBot got a good response from the real users and was able to grab
   100+ real followers along with some real interactions in form of
   retweet, mention and direct messages.},

Abstract = {Recently, smart home technologies and Internet of Things (IoT) have made
   it easy to control, monitor and secure properties, specially; while
   being away. In this context, several security and alarm systems have
   been proposed over the last decade. However, most of these systems lack
   any intelligent components, which make the alarm system generalize
   beyond the strictly, user predefined actions; therefore minimize false
   and nuisance alarms. In this paper, we propose an intelligent alarm
   system, which utilizes machine learning techniques to intelligently
   detect threats based on the environment data collected by different
   sensors and Arduino microcontroller; and then notify the owner by email
   message on real time basis. As the results section shows, the proposed
   system achieved high performance, and low false positive rate (false
   alarms).},

Abstract = {PurposeDistinguishing phishing emails from legitimate emails continues
   to be a difficult task for most individuals. This study aims to
   investigate the psycholinguistic factors associated with deception in
   phishing email text and their effect on end-user ability to discriminate
   phishing emails from legitimate emails. Design/methodology/approachEmail
   messages and end-user decisions collected from a laboratory phishing
   study were validated and analyzed using natural language processing
   methods (Linguistic Inquiry Word Count) and penalized regression models
   (LASSO and Elastic Net) to determine the linguistic dimensions that
   attackers may use in phishing emails to deceive end-users and measure
   the impact of such choices on end-user susceptibility to phishing.
   FindingsWe found that most participants, who played the role of a
   phisher in the study, chose to deceive their end-user targets by
   pretending to be a familiar individual and presenting time pressure or
   deadlines. Results show that use of words conveying certainty (e.g.
   always, never) and work-related features in the phishing messages
   predicted higher end-user vulnerability. On the contrary, use of words
   that convey achievement (e.g. earn, win) or reward (cash, money) in the
   phishing messages predicted lower end-user vulnerability because such
   features are usually observed in scam-like messages. Practical
   implicationsInsights from this research show that analyzing emails for
   psycholinguistic features associated with computer-mediated deception
   could be used to fine-tune and improve spam and phishing detection
   technologies. This research also informs the kinds of phishing attacks
   that must be prioritized in antiphishing training programs.
   Originality/valueApplying natural language processing and statistical
   modeling methods to analyze results from a laboratory phishing
   experiment to understand deception from both attacker and end-user is
   novel. Furthermore, results from this work advance our understanding of
   the linguistic factors associated with deception in phishing email text
   and its impact on end-user susceptibility.},

Title = {Beyond the Shortest Route: A Survey on Quality-Aware Route Navigation
   for Pedestrians},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {135569-135590},
Abstract = {Navigation systems often aid users when traveling in unfamiliar
   locations. Current navigation systems tend to focus on identifying the
   shortest or fastest routes between two points. However, path cost
   expressed in terms of length and distance (i.e., the utilitarian
   qualities of travel) is only one attribute which could be used in route
   recommendation. Recent years have seen navigation systems moving beyond
   such utilitarian attributes. These include systems aimed at providing
   users with scenic, safe or attractive routes among other dimensions. In
   this paper, we contribute to the existing research domain by providing
   an overview of the different quality-aware route navigation systems that
   have been proposed in past research for pedestrians. In particular, we
   examine the different qualities which have been used as key criteria in
   route recommendation. As the outcome of the paper, we provide a
   categorization of these systems based on our proposed SWEEP taxonomy. In
   addition, we outline the various data sources, algorithms and evaluation
   approaches that have been used to implement quality-aware route
   navigation systems. Afterwards, we conclude by discussing potential
   problems encountered in previous studies and highlight promising
   directions for future research.},

Abstract = {In day to day life the use of video streaming services with different
   systems has become a key factor, as the technology is tending more
   towards the development of digital systems. Among such systems or
   devices, IPTV, smart TV, Social TV systems are more popular now days,
   because of its prime factors like voice calling, video calling, SMS
   service, Internet, entertainment, e-commerce service, email service
   social network service, etc. That is why internet service provider is
   also willing to provide all the above mentioned services through a
   single line. Considering these facts main factors in the development of
   such systems is the user perceived experience, i.e. QoE In other words,
   the quality of experience with the system. In this paper, considering
   QoE factor we have determined an approach that helps to estimate the
   user's QoE which uses a full reference model and helps to evaluate
   factors that measures the video quality effectively.},

Title = {Detecting Covid-19 chaos driven phishing/malicious URL attacks by a

Abstract = {With confusion and uncertainty ruling the world, 2020 created
   near-perfect conditions for cybercriminals. As businesses virtually
   eliminated in-person experiences, the COVID-19 pandemic changed the way
   we live and caused a mass migration to digital platforms. However, this
   shift also made people more vulnerable to cyber-crime. Victims are being
   targeted by attackers for their credentials or financial rewards, or
   both. This is because the Internet itself is inherently difficult to
   secure, and the attackers can code in a way that exploits its flaws.
   Once the attackers gain root access to the devices, they have complete
   control and can do whatever they want. Consequently, taking advantage of
   highly unprecedented circumstances created by the Covid-19 event,
   cybercriminals launched massive phishing, malware, identity theft, and
   ransomware attacks. Therefore, if we wish to save people from these
   frauds in times when millions have already been tipped into poverty and
   the rest are trying hard to sustain, it is imperative to curb these
   attacks and attackers. This paper analyses the impact of Covid-19 on
   various cyber-security related aspects and sketches out the timeline of
   Covid-19 themed cyber-attacks launched globally to identify the modus
   operandi of the attackers and the impact of attacks. It also offers a
   thoroughly researched set of mitigation strategies which can be employed
   to prevent the attacks in the first place. Moreover, this manuscript
   proposes a fuzzy logic and data mining-based intelligence system for
   detecting Covid-19 themed malicious URL/phishing attacks. The
   performance of the system has been evaluated against various
   malicious/phishing URLs, and it was observed that the proposed system is
   a viable solution to this problem. (C) 2022 THE AUTHORS. Published by

Title = {The consequences of emotionally evocative patient behaviors on emergency
   nurses' patient assessments and handoffs: An experimental study using
   simulated patient cases},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {143},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Engaging with human emotions is an integral but poorly
   understood part of the work of emergency healthcare providers. Patient
   factors (e.g., irritable behavior; mental illness) can evoke strong
   emotions, and evidence suggests that these emotions can impact care
   quality and patient safety. Given that nurses play a critical role in
   providing high quality care, efforts to identify and remedy factors that
   may compromise care are needed. Yet to date, few experiments have been
   conducted.Objective: To examine the effects of emotionally evocative
   patient behavior as well as the presence of mental illness on emergency
   nurses' emotions, patient assessments, testing advocacy, and written
   handoffs.Design: Experimental vignette research.Setting: Online
   experiment distributed via email between October and December
   2020.Participants: Convenience sample of 130 emergency nurses from seven
   hospitals in the Northeastern United States and one hospital in the
   mid-Atlantic region in the United States.Methods: Nurses completed four
   multimedia computer-simulated patient encounters in which patient
   behavior (irritable vs. calm) and mental illness (present vs. absent)
   were experimentally varied. Nurses reported their emotions and clinical
   assessments, recommended diagnostic tests, and provided written
   handoffs. Tests were coded for whether the test would result in a
   correct diagnosis, and handoffs were coded for negative and positive
   patient descriptions and the presence of speafic clinical
   information.Results: Nurses experienced more negative emotions (anger,
   unease) and reported less engagement when assessing patients exhibiting
   irritable (vs. calm) behavior. Nurses also judged patients with
   irritable (vs. calm) behavior as more likely to exaggerate their pain
   and as poorer historians, and as less likely to cooperate, return to
   work, and recover. Nurses' handoffs were more likely to communicate
   negative descriptions of patients with irritable (vs. calm) behavior and
   omit speafic clinical information (e.g., whether tests were ordered,
   per-sonal information). The presence of mental illness increased unease
   and sadness and resulted in nurses being less likely to recommend a
   necessary test for a correct diagnosis.Conclusions: Emergency nurses'
   assessments and handoffs were impacted by patient factors, particularly
   irritable patient behavior. As nurses are central to the clinical team
   and experience regular, close contact with patients, the effects of
   irritable patient behavior on nursing assessments and care practices
   have important implications. We discuss potential approaches to address
   these ill effects, including reflexive practice, teamwork, and
   standardiza-tion of handoffs.Tweetable abstract: Experimental evidence
   links irritable patient behaviors to lower quality emergency depart-ment
   nurse handoffs, which may compromise patient safety @(lindamisbell)

Abstract = {Recently, research on fraudulent email detection has expanded from its
   purely technological orientation into understanding the role of human
   behavior in security breaches. However, an area that has been lacking is
   literature/theory-grounded content analysis in social engineering
   threat. While there exists an extensive body of anecdotal subjective
   literature, factors that account for phishing attack's incessant success
   remain largely speculative. To better understand this, we propose a
   dimensional framework to identify the thematic nature of phishing emails
   that would not only help to understand the underlining technical
   subterfuge but also enhance our knowledge to effectively sense
   contextual social engineering tricks and the nature of such attacks,
   from multiple angles. To validate the dimensional elements, we will
   employ topic modeling techniques to analyze the themes of fraudulent
   email attack utilizing four benchmark datasets. Based on the analysis,
   this study discusses theoretical contributions and practical
   recommendations along with further directions of the research.},

Abstract = {Many Palestinian higher education institutions had a successful
   experience in utilizing Electronic Services and Electronic learning,
   such as all the academic services for student and lecturer, schedule
   lectures, exams schedule, viewing the academic information, grades
   report, printing transcript, registering courses, library services,
   Email services, News and Announcements, but these services are supported
   by web based applications or desktop application which restrict the
   access of the users using computers or laptops, But there is a lack in
   supporting these services with mobile. Especially when dealing with
   sensitive data as inserting grades for courses. So in this paper we
   present a system called Secure Mobile Cloud Computing for Sensitive
   Data: Teacher Services for Palestinian Higher Education Institutions
   (MCCTSs) which is a mobile application to facilities access using RSA
   algorithm to encrypt the data which sent and received through Cloud
   computing application. MCCTSs serve the lecturers of Palestinian higher
   education institutions. Agile methodology was adapted to develop MCCTSs
   application. MCCTSs users successfully insert the grades securely and
   encrypted any time anywhere using RSA algorithm. It is hoped that the
   result of this study will encourage the universities to engage MCCTSs in
   their services. From the results we obtained, it is proved that RSA
   provides protection for the data, which is stored in Cloud. Only
   authorized user can read the encrypted data and decrypt it. Even if
   anyone happens to read the data accidentally, the original meaning of
   the data will not be understood.},

Abstract = {Spam emails have long been a source of concern in the field of computer
   security. They are both monetarily and technologically costly, as well
   as extremely harmful to computers and networks. Despite the rise of
   social networks and other Internet-based information exchange venues,
   email communication has become increasingly important over time,
   necessitating the urgent improvement of spam filters. Although various
   spam filters have been developed to help prevent spam emails from
   reaching a user's mailbox, there has been little research into text
   modifications. Because of its simplicity and efficiency, Naive Bayes is
   currently one of the most used methods of spam classification. However,
   when emails contain leetspeak or diacritics, Naive Bayes is unable to
   correctly categorize them. As a result, we created a novel method to
   improve the accuracy of the Naive Bayes Spam Filter to detect text
   alterations and correctly classify emails as Spam or ham in this
   proposal. When compared to Spamassassin, our Python approach uses a
   combination of semantic, keyword, and machine learning algorithms to
   improve Naive Bayes accuracy. Furthermore, we identified a link between
   email length and spam score, indicating that Bayesian Poisoning, a
   contentious concept, is an actual occurrence used by spammers. Copyright

Title = {Promotion of secure software development assimilation: stimulating
   individual motivation},
Journal = {CHINESE MANAGEMENT STUDIES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Pages = {164-183},
Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this study was to establish a
   Technology-Organization-Personality model of secure software development
   (SSD) innovation assimilation at the level of individual motivation. The
   model identifies individual psychological motivation, which influences
   innovation assimilation intention and behavior. It constitutes an
   organizational management view of SSD innovation assimilation from
   individual psychological motivation perspective.
   Design/methodology/approach An empirical study was employed to verify
   the assumption model. Semi-structured user interviews were conducted
   with some security experts to consult their advice and obtain the
   measurement scales. And questionnaires were circulated at a focus group
   meeting and among some software security professionals by email. Of 230
   questionnaires that were answered, 215 could be used. IBM SPSS 19.0 and
   AMOS 17.0 were used alternately to analyze the data. Structural equation
   model was employed to verify the hypotheses of the model.
   Findings Results reveal that two types of individual motivation can
   influence SSD innovation assimilation, namely, potential organization
   support and individual needs. Furthermore, absorption capability was
   found to play a regulated function in the transition of SSD assimilation
   intention to behavior.
   Originality/value The findings reveal how individual motivation plays an
   important role in promoting complex innovation assimilation. It fills
   the gap of the research on organizational assimilation behavior and
   individual motivation in the context of SSD complex innovation, and
   provides management of software development organization with
   empirically based conceptualization to guide their personnel incentive
   policymaking.},

Abstract = {There is a growing interest in personal data mining and user profiling
   to improve the surveillance practices for rapid analysis of underlying
   business patterns. User profiling from Personally Identifiable
   Information (PII) is one such technique to breach personal data privacy
   in mobile devices, web browser, smart homes, Internet of Things (IoT)
   etc. This study proposes a PIT risk factor by bringing aggregated risk
   modelling of personal information in the IoT environment. Intuitively,
   most of the IoT devices are produced by identical manufacturers.
   Similarly, smart devices typically assemble facts from plentiful devices
   where collected information's owners are mutually inclusive. Proposed
   Massive Personal Information Clustering (MPIC) model shows that IoT
   product manufacturing companies can cluster PIT collected from a) IoT
   device managing application and b) device data flow. Subsequently,
   owner-centric aggregated IoT device data can reveal user ID, which was
   not considered by other studies. Our approach was validated by
   satisfactory data analysis from IoT standardization organization (Open
   Connectivity Forum), Android and iOS app store. The analysis shows 80-90
   percent of available ToT devices are manufactured by 6-10 major
   companies with 5 potential PIT threats. Personal information like
   location, email, biological ID, contextual actions and social graph are
   at risk if collective information gathering (aggregation) through
   multiple IoT devices are not correctly measured. Finally, research
   directions in establishing privacy preservation in smart IoT ecosystem
   are advocated.},

   with an email virus model and compare the behaviors of virus spreading
   in Facebook and email network. We find that while Facebook provides a
   platform for application developers, it also provides the same chance
   for virus spreading. And virus will spread faster in Facebook network if
   users of Facebook spend more time on it for entertainment.},

Abstract = {Surveillance plays a crucial role in day-to-day life. A typical
   surveillance system continuously monitors its vicinity and stores the
   surveillance data locally. This may end up in lots of memory and energy
   wastage. Moreover, the surveillance records are under security threat,
   when the surveillance system is seized or damaged by the intruders. In
   this paper, a new design for surveillance using smartphone along with
   the passive infrared (PIR) sensor and the microcontroller unit (MCU) is
   proposed. The PIR sensor is attached to the smartphone through the MCU
   to detect motion. The video is captured only when the motion is detected
   and the short message services alert is sent to the user straight away.
   To overcome the memory restrictions of smartphone and to ensure the safe
   storage of surveillance records, it is uploaded in cloud, and the link
   is sent to the user through email. The proposed intelligent surveillance
   system offers cost effective, storage effective, energy efficient, and
   secured solution as it uses the computation and communication
   capabilities of the smartphone and the storage capabilities of cloud.},

Abstract = {Online trackers are invasive as they track our digital footprints, many
   of which are sensitive in nature, and when aggregated over time, they
   can help infer intricate details about our lifestyles and habits.
   Although much research has been conducted to understand the
   effectiveness of existing countermeasures for the desktop platform,
   little is known about how mobile browsers have evolved to handle online
   trackers. With mobile devices now generating more web traffic than their
   desktop counterparts, we fill this research gap through a large-scale
   comparative analysis of mobile web browsers. We crawl 10K valid websites
   from the Tranco list on real mobile devices. Our data collection process
   covers both popular generic browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, and Safari)
   as well as privacy-focused browsers (e.g., Brave, Duck Duck Go, and
   Firefox-Focus). We use dynamic analysis of runtime execution traces and
   static analysis of source codes to highlight the tracking behavior of
   invasive fingerprinters. We also find evidence of tailored content being
   served to different browsers. In particular, we note that Firefox Focus
   sees altered script code, whereas Brave and Duck Duck Go have highly
   similar content. To test the privacy protection of browsers, we measure
   the responses of each browser in blocking trackers and advertisers and
   note the strengths and weaknesses of privacy browsers. To establish
   ground truth, we use well-known block lists, including EasyList,
   EasyPrivacy, Disconnect and WhoTracksMe and find that Brave generally
   blocks the highest number of content that should be blocked as per these
   lists. Focus performs better against social trackers, and Duck Duck Go
   restricts third-party trackers that perform email-based tracking.},

Abstract = {Behavioral biometrics, being non-intrusive and cost-efficient, have the
   potential to assist user identification and authentication. However,
   user behaviors can vary significantly for different hardware, software,
   and applications. Research of behavioral biometrics is needed in the
   context of a specific application. Moreover, it is hard to collect user
   data in real world settings to assess how well behavioral biometrics can
   discriminate users. This work aims to improving authentication by
   behavioral biometrics obtained for user groups. User data of a webmail
   application are collected in a large-scale user experiment conducted on
   Amazon Mechanical Turk. Used in a continuous authentication scheme based
   on user groups, off-line identity attribution and online authentication
   analytic schemes are proposed to study the applicability of
   application-specific behavioral biometrics. Our results suggest that the
   useful user group identity can be effectively inferred from users'
   operational interaction with the email application.},

Abstract = {The internet is widely used for health information and support, often by
   vulnerable people. Internet-based research raises both familiar and new
   ethical problems for researchers and ethics committees. While guidelines
   for internet-based research are available, it is unclear to what extent
   ethics committees use these. Experience of gaining research ethics
   approval for a UK study (SharpTalk), involving internet-based discussion
   groups with young people who self-harm and health professionals is
   described. During ethical review, unsurprisingly, concerns were raised
   about the vulnerability of potential participants. These were dominated
   by the issue of anonymity, which also affected participant safety and
   consent. These ethical problems are discussed, and our solutions, which
   included: participant usernames specific to the study, a closed website,
   private messaging facilities, a direct contact email to researchers,
   information about forum rules displayed on the website, a `report'
   button for participants, links to online support, and a discussion room
   for forum moderators. This experience with SharpTalk suggests that an
   approach to ethics, which recognises the relational aspects of research
   with vulnerable people, is particularly useful for internet-based health
   research. The solutions presented here can act as guidance for
   researchers developing proposals and for ethics committees reviewing
   them.},

Title = {Design and evaluation of the highly insidious extreme phishing attacks},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {70},
Pages = {634-647},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {One of the most severe and challenging threats to Internet security is
   phishing, which uses spoofed websites to steal users' passwords and
   online identities. Phishers mainly use spoofed emails or instant
   messages to lure users to the phishing websites. A spoofed email or
   instant message provides the first-layer context to entice users to
   click on a phishing URL, and the phishing website further provides the
   second-layer context with the look and feel similar to a targeted
   legitimate website to lure users to submit their login credentials. In
   this paper, we focus on the second-layer context to explore the extreme
   of phishing attacks; we explore the feasibility of creating extreme
   phishing attacks that have the almost identical look and feel as those
   of the targeted legitimate websites, and evaluate the effectiveness of
   such phishing attacks. We design and implement a phishing toolkit that
   can support both the traditional phishing and the newly emergent Web
   Single Sign-On (SSO) phishing; our toolkit can automatically construct
   unlimited levels of phishing webpages in real time based on user
   interactions. We design and perform a user study with 194 participants
   to evaluate the effectiveness of the phishing attacks constructed from
   this toolkit. The results demonstrate that extreme phishing attacks are
   indeed highly effective and insidious as over 90\% of the participants
   became the ``victims{''}. It is reasonable to assume that extreme
   phishing attacks will be widely adopted and deployed in the future, and
   we call for a collective effort to effectively defend against them. (C)

Abstract = {In this study, a low latent edge-based fire and smoke detection and
   alert system was designed to detect and prevent indoor fires caused by
   human or machine faults, or lack of appropriate fire safety measures. To
   live comfortably in this fast-paced society, safety is a must. To detect
   early signs of fire, smoke and flammable gases, a real-time fire
   detection system was developed by combining a Raspberry Pi and a
   Raspberry Pi camera v2. Images taken from an open-source fire and smoke
   dataset were annotated and fed to the models. The model selection
   involved training YOLOv4-tiny, YOLOv5s TensorFlow lite pre-trained
   models, and deploying the most feasible transfer learned model having a
   higher mean average precision (mAP) on Raspberry Pi, which acts as the
   edge device. It performs real-time analysis of live feed captured by a
   Raspberry Pi camera, sends email alerts to the user stating confirmation
   of the presence of fire or smoke, and prevents false alarms caused due
   to the data collected by IoT devices by conducting a double check with
   the captured feed for detection. The user can act upon this notification
   and ensure timely preventive action. The proposed state-of-the-art
   indoor alert system achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 42.3 for
   fire, 35.4 for smoke classes; a precision of 58.5 for fire, 64.3 for
   smoke and a recall of 45.9 for fire and 33.3 for smoke respectively. If
   the system is improved in the future, it is expected that it will be
   able to give faster and more accurate alerts.},

Abstract = {Today's on-line end user experience is compromised by the need for
   managing multiple redundant identities for access to various services -
   such as email accounts, in order to ensure a clear separation of tasks
   that users perform in different capacities. Approaches based on Single
   Sign On (SSO) have focused on the provision of interoperability and
   trust management solutions required to allow users to log in once and
   use multiple on-line services. In this paper, we argue that Single Sign
   On provides neither adequate privacy preservation nor sufficient
   fine-grained separation of tasks, as it requires that a user performs
   all tasks - whether e.g. personal or professional - using the same
   identity. We propose Identity and Role Management (IRM), a new approach
   to identity management, combining the benefits of SSO and user-centric
   frameworks: it allows a user to be authenticated as conveniently as with
   SSO, to still achieve an effective separation of tasks she performs in
   different capacities through the use of different roles, and to retain
   full control of her private and sensitive data. Additionally, it
   facilitates fine-grained service customisation, supporting a
   personalised on-line experience. Our experiments with real users
   demonstrate the effectiveness, transparency, and user acceptance of our
   solution.},
