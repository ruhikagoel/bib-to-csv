Abstract = {Today's on-line end user experience is compromised by the need for
   managing multiple redundant identities for access to various services -
   such as email accounts, in order to ensure a clear separation of tasks
   that users perform in different capacities. Approaches based on Single
   Sign On (SSO) have focused on the provision of interoperability and
   trust management solutions required to allow users to log in once and
   use multiple on-line services. In this paper, we argue that Single Sign
   On provides neither adequate privacy preservation nor sufficient
   fine-grained separation of tasks, as it requires that a user performs
   all tasks - whether e.g. personal or professional - using the same
   identity. We propose Identity and Role Management (IRM), a new approach
   to identity management, combining the benefits of SSO and user-centric
   frameworks: it allows a user to be authenticated as conveniently as with
   SSO, to still achieve an effective separation of tasks she performs in
   different capacities through the use of different roles, and to retain
   full control of her private and sensitive data. Additionally, it
   facilitates fine-grained service customisation, supporting a
   personalised on-line experience. Our experiments with real users
   demonstrate the effectiveness, transparency, and user acceptance of our
   solution.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: As millions of workers have shifted to telework, special
   accommodations for workers with respect to ergonomics may be required to
   ensure the workforce remains healthy.
   METHODS: A survey about home office ergonomics and discomfort was sent
   to faculty, staff, and administrators by email and was completed by 843
   individuals.
   RESULTS: Over 40\% of the participants reported moderate to severe
   discomfort (severe low/middle back pain, moderate discomfort in
   eyes/neck/head, and discomfort in the upper back/shoulders). Laptops
   (always and often) were widely used (85\%) with most using the laptop
   monitor (55\%) of all respondents. Further, less than 45\% of the
   seating conditions were reported as having adjustable arm rests.
   CONCLUSION: As teleworking in makeshift offices becomes more common, the
   risk of significant discomfort and potentially more serious
   musculoskeletal disorders may result from poor static postures.
   Companies may need to accommodate workers by allowing them to take home
   office chairs, external monitors, keyboards, and mice as laptops are
   insufficient, ergonomically.},

Title = {Susceptibility to phishing on social network sites: A personality
   information processing model},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {94},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Today, the traditional approach used to conduct phishing attacks through
   email and spoofed websites has evolved to include social network sites
   (SNSs). This is because phishers are able to use similar methods to
   entice social network users to click on malicious links masquerading as
   fake news, controversial videos and other opportunities thought to be
   attractive or beneficial to the victim. SNSs are a phisher's
   ``market{''} as they offer phishers a wide range of targets and take
   advantage of opportunities that exploit the behavioural vulnerabilities
   of their users. As such, it is important to further investigate aspects
   affecting behaviour when users are presented with phishing. Based on the
   literature studied, this research presents a theoretical model to
   address phishing susceptibility on SNSs. Using data collected from 215
   respondents, the study examined the mediating role that information
   processing plays with regard to user susceptibility to social network
   phishing based on their personality traits, thereby identifying user
   characteristics that may be more susceptible than others to phishing on
   SNSs. The results from the structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis
   revealed that conscientious users were found to have a negative
   influence on heuristic processing, and are thus less susceptible to
   phishing on SNSs. The study also confirmed that heuristic processing
   increases susceptibility to phishing, thus supporting prior studies in
   this area. This research contributes to the information security
   discipline as it is one of the first to examine the effect of the
   relationship between the Big Five personality model and the
   heuristic-systematic model of information processing. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {Continuous Authentication (CA) consists of monitoring and checking
   repeatedly and unobtrusively user behavior during a computing session in
   order to discriminate between legitimate and impostor behaviors.
   Stylometry analysis, which consists of checking whether a target
   document was written or not by a specific individual, could potentially
   be used for CA. In this work, we adapt existing stylometric features and
   develop a new authorship verification model applicable for continuous
   authentication. We use existing lexical, syntactic, and application
   specific features, and propose new features based on n-gram analysis. We
   start initially with a large features set, and identify a reduced number
   of user-specific features by computing the information gain. In
   addition, our approach includes a strategy to circumvent issues
   regarding unbalanced dataset which is an inherent problem in stylometry
   analysis. We use Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification.
   Experimental evaluation based on the Enron email dataset involving 76
   authors yields very promising results consisting of an Equal Error Rate
   (EER) of 12.42\% for message blocks of 500 characters.},

Abstract = {Background: When triage personnel do not follow the triage procedure and
   do not properly determine the triage level, patient safety is
   jeopardized. As a result, the involved staff's comprehension of the
   triage algorithm and its documentation will serve as a foundation for
   the triage system's proper implementation and functioning. Objective:
   The aim of this study will be to assess facilitators, barriers, the
   magnitude of completeness, and userfriendliness of emergency department
   triage format in three selected Ethiopian Public Hospitals. Method: The
   study design will be a quantitative ,cross-sectional, and programmatic
   qualitative research, with an estimated sample size of 384 cards.
   Systematic random sampling and criterion sampling will be applied for
   quantitative and qualitative parts respectively. Data will be collected
   using a data collection checklist. Descriptive frequency and
   distribution analysis of the data will be conducted by using a
   Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 25). The
   association between relevant characteristics and triage format
   completeness will be examined using the binary and multinominal logistic
   regression analysis. To determine the significant factors, P-values of
   0.05 and AOR with \% CI will be applied. Qualitative data will be
   analyzed thematically. A focus group discussion with nurses who have
   used the triage chart before will be held for the qualitative component.
   Five FGD at the very least, or until saturation is reached. Discussion:
   The primary investigator made a concept note on the observed gaps in the
   triage system, and a team of experts from several institutions with
   experience in research and publication held a follow-up meeting in
   addition to sub-team physical meetings and email communication. Finally,
   after reaching an agreement on objectives and techniques, authors were
   assigned separate tasks. The grant had been secured from the funder, and
   the institutional review board issued a permission letter. After
   analyzing the data, these findings will be shared with the respective
   facilities and published in a reputable journal. Work plan and budget:
   The overall research activities will be performed based on the prepared
   timetable. A financial expense of 256,900 Birr will be required for the
   achievement of this project. {[}Ethiop. J. Health Dev. 2024; 38(2):

Title = {AIoT-Based Smart Stick for Visually Impaired Person},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {72},
Abstract = {Visually impaired people are facing difficulties during day-to-day
   activities in terms of traveling and receiving accurate information from
   their surroundings. Most of the time, visually impaired persons need to
   rely on others. Blind people cannot walk without the support of a cane.
   Artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) is the solution to designing
   smart devices for the visually impaired. We propose a smart stick that
   overcomes most of the problems of the visually impaired person. The
   stick actually helps to detect the obstacles faced in day-to-day life.
   The visually impaired person can also recognize objects and currency
   with the help of a deep learning algorithm applied to images captured by
   the camera installed in the stick. The pulse sensor installed on the
   stick monitors the health of the user. The smart stick is embedded with
   Raspberry pi and a global positioning system (GPS) that helps in sensing
   emergency alerts. The proposed smart stick also provides timing
   information about available buses near the location to enable choosing
   travel times in advance. Sensors are used for achieving these functions.
   Android application that is connected with firebase is also developed
   for tracking data about the user (health, location, etc.) from a remote
   location. The Overall obstacle detection accuracy of the system is
   91.7\% for various demonstrations and the single module will be
   available at around \$50- \$60. The proposed system is cost-effective,
   lightweight and user-friendly. The main goal of this system is to ensure
   the safety of visually impaired persons and to provide a better life for
   them.},

Title = {A Cognitive Deception Model for Generating Fake Documents to Curb Data
   Exfiltration in Networks During Cyber-Attacks},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {41457-41476},
Abstract = {The exponential increase in the compromise of sensitive and intellectual
   properties alludes to the huge price the global community must pay for
   the digital revolution we are currently experiencing. This irrefutable
   reality is a major reason why cybersecurity defences continue to be a
   pressing and timely area of research. Traditional countermeasures of
   cyber defence using boundary controllers and filters such as intrusion
   detection, access controls, firewalls and so on, have proven
   ineffective. Such measures fail to account for the attacker's inherent
   advantage of being increasingly techno-savvy, as well as their
   persistence in attempting to compromise the security of not only
   high-value targets, but also the vast pool of oblivious users of
   technology. The use of decoys and deception is one of the emerging
   solutions for cyber defence. Leveraging decoys and deception for
   security pre-date the advent of the digital revolution as centuries have
   witnessed the military using human decoys to deceive and successfully
   defeat their adversaries during wars. However, its benefits for reducing
   cyberattacks in these digital times have not been thoroughly
   investigated. One of its use requires that fake text documents are
   positioned in the repository of critical documents in order to mislead
   and catch hackers attempting to exfiltrate sensitive documents. Current
   methods of generating fake text documents involve using symbols, junk
   documents, randomly generated texts. Such approaches fail to capture the
   empirical and linguistic properties of language, resulting in messages
   that do not scale well, are not realistic, fail in the context of syntax
   and are semantically void. Consequently, failing to convince the
   attackers to believe they are the original messages. This paper presents
   a Cognitive Deception Model (CDM) based on a neural model which takes an
   input message and generates syntactically cohesive and semantically
   coherent independent looking but plausible and convincing decoy messages
   to cognitively burden and deceive the adversaries. The experimental
   results used to validate the models, as well as the comparison with
   state-of-the-art tools, show that it outperforms existing systems.},

Abstract = {Reporting phishing attacks can significantly shorten the time required
   to take down their operations and deter further victimization by the
   same phishing websites. However, little research has been conducted to
   understand the phishing reporting ecosystem and its effectiveness. In
   this paper, we comprehensively evaluate the phishing reporting ecosystem
   to identify the critical challenges people face and their concerns when
   reporting smishing, vishing, and phishing email attacks. First, we
   analyze the existing security advice and channels for reporting phishing
   attacks in both the public and private sectors. Then, we conduct a
   scenario-based experiment involving 89 participants to investigate what
   factors affect a participant's decision to report a phishing attack and
   what challenges they face in preparing the report. Third, we report
   phishing attacks ourselves and monitor the status of the reported
   phishing websites to empirically measure how reports are acted upon and
   how that affects the reported phishing websites. Finally, we propose
   approaches under five major concern categories to mitigate the
   challenges that we discover in the phishing reporting ecosystem.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is highly
   expressed in >85\% of human tumors and is thus considered as a good
   tumor-associated antigen candidate for vaccine development. We conducted
   a phase I study to investigate the safety, tolerability, clinical
   response, and immunogenicity of INVAC-1, a DNA plasmid encoding a
   modified hTERT protein in patients with relapsed or refractory solid
   tumors.
   Patients and Methods: INVAC-1 was either administered by intradermal
   route followed by electroporation or by Tropis, a needle-free injection
   system. Safety and tolerability were monitored by clinical and
   laboratory assessments. Progression-free survival and overall survival
   were reported using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Immunogenicity was
   studied by ELISpot, Luminex, and Flow Cytometry.
   Results: Twenty-six patients were treated with INVAC-1 administered at
   three dose levels (100, 400, and 800 mu g). Vaccination was well
   tolerated and no dose-limiting toxicity was reported. One
   treatment-related grade 3 SAE was reported. Fifty-eight percent of
   patients experienced disease stabilization. PFS was 2.7 months, median
   OS was 15 months, and 1-year survival was reached for 65\% of patients.
   INVAC-1 vaccination stimulated specific anti-hTERT CD4 T-cell response
   as well as cytotoxic CD8 T-cell response. No evidence of peripheral
   vaccine-induced immunosuppression was observed.
   Conclusions: INVAC-1 vaccination was safe, well tolerated, and
   immunogenic when administered intradermally at the three tested doses in
   patients with relapsed or refractory cancers. Disease stabilization was
   observed for the majority of patients (58\%) during the treatment period
   and beyond.},

Abstract = {Power dynamics shape, and are shaped by, the tools used by participants
   in social movements. In this study we explore the values, attitudes, and
   beliefs of Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street stakeholders as they relate
   to their use of technology. This multi-method study applies the lens of
   value sensitive design {[}VSD; Friedman, B. (Ed.) (1997). Human values
   and the design of computer technology (vol. 72). Cambridge: Cambridge
   University Press] to examine stakeholder values and sites of value
   tension. We contextualize our findings with qualitative observation of
   how these values are reflected in each organization's online spaces,
   including Facebook, Twitter, and key organizational websites, as well as
   private spaces such as email. We found liberty, the value most mentioned
   by Tea Party members, was not reflected in the movement's organizational
   websites and Facebook pages, where user autonomy is frequently
   undermined. However, the Occupy value of equality is supported in the
   movement's web presence. We also found a set of shared central values -
   privacy and security, inclusion, and consensus - underlying both Tea
   Party and Occupy's approach to organization and participation. Value
   tensions around privacy and inclusion emerged for both groups, as some
   members opted not to use these tools due to security concerns and
   leaders struggled to adapt their communication strategies accordingly.
   This study provides insight into the adoption and contestation of
   different technological tools within grassroots social movements, how
   those decisions are shaped by core values, and how conflicts over the
   use of digital tools can result from tension between how different
   stakeholders prioritize those values.},

Title = {Electronic Co-design (ECO-design) Workshop for Increasing Clinician
   Participation in the Design of Health Services Interventions:
   Participatory Design Approach},
Journal = {JMIR HUMAN FACTORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Participation from clinician stakeholders can improve the
   design and implementation of health care interventions. Participatory
   design methods, especially co-design methods, comprise stakeholder-led
   design activities that are time-consuming. Competing work demands and
   increasing workloads make clinicians' commitments to typical
   participatory methods even harder. The COVID-19 pandemic further
   exacerbated barriers to clinician participation in such interventions.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to explore a web-based
   participatory design approach to conduct economical, electronic
   co-design (ECO-design) workshops with primary care clinicians.
   Methods: We adapted traditional in-person co-design workshops to
   web-based delivery and adapted co-design workshop series to fit within a
   single 1-hour session. We applied the ECO-design workshop approach to
   codevelop feedback interventions regarding abnormal test result
   follow-up in primary care. We conducted ECO-design workshops with
   primary care clinicians at a medical center in Southern Texas, using
   videoconferencing software. Each workshop focused on one of three types
   of feedback interventions: conversation guide, email template, and
   dashboard prototype. We paired electronic materials and software
   features to facilitate participant interactions, prototyping, and data
   collection. The workshop protocol included four main activities: problem
   identification, solution generation, prototyping, and debriefing. Two
   facilitators were assigned to each workshop and one researcher resolved
   technical problems. After the workshops, our research team met to
   debrief and evaluate workshops.
   Results: A total of 28 primary care clinicians participated in our
   ECO-design workshops. We completed 4 parallel workshops, each with 5-10
   participants. We conducted traditional analyses and generated a
   clinician persona (ie, representative description) and user interface
   prototypes. We also formulated recommendations for future ECO-design
   workshop recruitment, technology, facilitation, and data collection.
   Overall, our adapted workshops successfully enabled primary care
   clinicians to participate without increasing their workload, even during
   a pandemic.
   Conclusions: ECO-design workshops are viable, economical alternatives to
   traditional approaches. This approach fills a need for efficient methods
   to involve busy clinicians in the design of health care interventions.},

Abstract = {Adequate Irrigation improves food security crisis, maintains parks and
   sport-fields in good condition. The city of Cape Town in South Africa is
   currently experiencing water scarcity due to lack of rainfall. This has
   been affecting all living beings and plants. So, an Automated Irrigation
   and Water Level Management System is proposed using Raspberry Pi. The
   main objective of the project is to try minimizing the human
   intervention (gardeners) and try improving the usage of water during
   irrigation, also prevent water storage from drying out and overflowing.
   This is done by providing a system that will solely operate
   automatically. The proposed System will also help in reducing
   municipality water bills, save energy, improve the irrigation method for
   farmers (commercial and residential). This is because irrigation will
   only take place when it is needed. A webserver is developed using node
   red dashboard which gives access to the user to check all the process
   information of the system. Through the webserver one can access
   information such as soil status (dry nor wet), water level status,
   temperature \& humidity status and email notification. Android smart
   phone or laptop can be used to access this information (display purpose)
   from the dashboard, they just must be connected to the same network as
   the system.},

Abstract = {Using password is, perhaps, still the most versatile method of securing
   secret and confidential information, even though several recent studies
   have pointed out possibility of breaching it. A general trend of having
   different passwords for several user accounts of the same user (such as
   multiple email accounts, multiple social networking accounts, etc.) can
   barely overcome the possibility as users mostly prefer retaining
   similarity among own passwords, which results in the possibility of
   breaching almost all passwords once only one password gets breached.
   Consequently, several research studies attempted to strengthen
   passwords. However, none of the studies is yet to get wide popularity
   for not being able to achieve a delicate balance between strength of
   password and user friendliness. To achieve this goal, we present a new
   password based authentication system in this paper. The proposed system
   is based on intermixing between a fixed text (conventional part of a
   password) and a free random text (newly added) at different pre-defined
   indices having different per-defined lengths. The addition of the free
   random text adds an additional level of difficulty in breaching the
   password. We present different variants of our proposed system along
   with their possible attack models. We demonstrate strength of our
   proposed system through rigorous analytical formulation and numerical
   simulation. Besides, we confirm achieving a delicate balance between
   strength of the password and user friendliness through performing real
   user evaluation.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on developing and validating an instrument to measure
   the readiness for Internet of Things (IoT) integration in fire detection
   systems for residential housing types. The main objective is to develop
   a valid and reliable survey instrument to assess users'readiness to
   accept and use IoT technology in the context of home fire safety. The
   research methodology involves a combination of the Technology Readiness
   Index (TRI) Theory and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as the
   theoretical basis for the development of instrument items. This process
   was followed by content validation involving six expert panel members
   appointed in the field of fire safety. Survey questions were distributed
   to experts via email. These experts assessed the proposed
   items'appropriateness, clarity, and relevance. The initial instrument
   consisted of 45 items covering the main dimensions of TRI (optimism,
   innovation, discomfort, insecurity), TAM constructs (perceived
   usefulness, perceived ease of use, and behavioral intention), and
   Readiness to use IoT for fire detection at home. The findings were
   analyzed using the Content Validity Ratio (CVR) and Content Validity
   Index (CVI) methods. Through the content validation process, 7 items
   were revised or filtered to produce a final instrument with 38 items.
   Findings show that the developed instrument has good content validity,
   with a satisfactory Content Validity Ratio (CVR) and Content Validity
   Index (CVI). Reliability analysis indicates high internal consistency
   across all dimensions of the instrument. This study contributes to the
   literature by providing a validated instrument to measure IoT
   integration readiness in residential fire detection systems. This
   instrument can be used by researchers, policymakers, and industry
   professionals to assess and predict IoT technology readiness in the
   context of home fire safety.},

Abstract = {There is demand for methodologies to establish levels of safety concern
   associated with dietary exposures to chemicals for which no
   toxicological data are available. In such situations, the application of
   in silico methods appears promising. To make safety statement requires
   quantitative predictions of toxicological reference points such as no
   observed adverse effect level and carcinogenic potency for DNA-reacting
   chemicals. A decision tree (DT) has been developed to aid integrating
   exposure information and predicted toxicological reference points
   obtained with quantitative structure activity relationship ((Q)SAR)
   software and read across techniques. The predicted toxicological values
   are compared with exposure to obtain margins of exposure (MoE). The size
   of the MoE defines the level of safety concern and should account for a
   number of uncertainties such as the classical interspecies and
   inter-individual variability as well as others determined on a case by
   case basis. An analysis of the uncertainties of in silico approaches
   together with results from case studies suggest that establishing safety
   concern based on application of the DT is unlikely to be significantly
   more uncertain than based on experimental data. The DT makes a full use
   of all data available, ensuring an adequate degree of conservatism. It
   can be used when fast decision making is required. (C) 2013 ILSI Europe.

Abstract = {Compromised machine is any computing resource whose availability,
   confidentiality, integrity has been negatively impacted either
   intentionally or unintentionally, by an untrusted source. These machines
   are often used to elevate various security attacks such as DDoS (attempt
   to make a machine resource unavailable to its intended users), spamming
   and identity theft (practice of using other person's name and personal
   information). The most important of these attacks are spamming wherein
   these machines are used to send large chunks of unsolicited mails called
   as spam. To detect these unwanted and unsolicited email and prevent them
   from getting into the user's inbox we use Spam filter. To detect the
   machine as compromised, SPOT algorithm has been designed. In this paper,
   we compare the effect of different types of spam filters on the SPOT
   algorithm on finding the compromised machines.},

Abstract = {The identity-based signature, initially introduced by Shamir {[}26],
   plays a fundamental role in the domain of identity-based cryptography.
   It offers the capability to generate a signature on a message, allowing
   any user to verify the authenticity of the signature using the signer's
   identifier information (e.g., an email address), instead of relying on a
   public key stored in a digital certificate. Another significant concept
   in practical applications is the threshold signature, which serves as a
   valuable tool for distributing the signing authority. The notion of an
   identity-based threshold signature scheme pertains to the distribution
   of a secret key associated with a specific identity among multiple
   entities, rather than depending on a master secret key generated by a
   public key generator. This approach enables a qualified group of
   participants to jointly engage in the signing process. In this paper, we
   present two identity-based threshold signature schemes based on
   isogenies, each of which addresses a different aspect of security. The
   first scheme prioritizes efficiency but offers security with abort,
   while the second scheme focuses on robustness. Both schemes ensure
   active security in the quantum random oracle model. To build these
   identity-based threshold signatures, we begin by modifying the
   identity-based signature scheme proposed by Shaw and Dutta {[}27], to
   accommodate the CSI-SharK signature scheme. Subsequently, we leverage
   the resulting identity-based signature and build two threshold schemes
   within the CSIDH (Commutative Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman)
   framework. Our proposed identity-based threshold signatures are designed
   based on CSI-SharK and can be easily adapted with minimal adjustments to
   function with CSI-FiSh.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, Internet is no longer private. Web service providers are
   trying to extract every single piece of user data for analytics or
   advertising purposes so that targeted ads or personalized contents can
   be provided. Collecting data of a user has also been easier for hackers
   with malicious intent. Publicly available data such as Personal
   Identifiable Information (PII) or breached account credentials are
   increasing the opportunity for attackers to gain access to users'
   account and information. Hence, users must be aware of personal data
   that they are sharing and constantly monitor security of their account.
   This paper presents a Digital Footprint and Breach Check (DFBC)
   Reconnaissance Tool which was developed to ease and speed up the process
   of extracting the publicly available information of users and checking
   account breach status. It comes with both Command Line Interface (CLI)
   and Graphical User Interface (GUI), thus both professional and novice
   users can utilize this tool and better understand the potential risks of
   their data and account. The tool focuses on gathering data in social
   network which are Facebook and Twitter, and email breach. From the
   results, it shows that 60\% strongly agree while the rest 40\% agree
   that the result gathered using this proposed tool is comprehensive.},

Abstract = {In the current age of big data, the access control mechanism of HBase, a
   kind of NoSQL big data management system, needs to be improved, because
   there are some limitations of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in HBase.
   The coarse-grained access permissions produce little effect in many
   cases, and the elements used for authorization are not comprehensive
   enough. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) is suitable for the
   authorization of NoSQL data storages due to its flexibility. However, it
   has not been investigated in HBase deeply. The objective of this paper
   is to study the data access control in HBase and to develop an
   ABAC-based mechanism for the security of HBase data. In light of the
   wide column feature of HBase, an Attribute-Based Fine-Grained Access
   Control mechanism (AGAC) is proposed, which covers two aspects, users'
   atomic operations and five granularity levels. When a user needs to
   access data in HBase storage, the AGAC will give the permission or deny
   by verifying user's atomic operations and by analyzing user's attributes
   according to the access control policies related to the data granularity
   level. This access control mechanism is verified on publically available
   email dataset and is proven to be effective to improve the access
   control capability of HBase.},

Abstract = {The Internet's ``tremendous power{''} to harm reputation is well-known.
   ``A reputation can be destroyed in the click of a mouse, an anonymous
   email or an ill-timed Tweet.{''}(1) Indeed, Internet postings can be
   widely disseminated via audio or video files, social and professional
   networking platforms, email messages, blog posts, electronic mailing
   lists, newsgroups or discussion fora, bulletin boards, web sites, framed
   or linked web pages, or search results produced by search engines. Such
   transmission or communication involves intermediaries such as service
   providers, web hosts and operators of email lists, forums or bulletin
   boards. By providing access to Internet content created by others, can
   intermediaries become liable for user/third party content? Intermediary
   liability is perhaps the thorniest of issues in Internet defamation and
   will be the focus of this paper. It will compare the position in other
   common law jurisdictions and conclude with a re-examination of how the
   publication rule should apply to intermediary liability in Singapore, in
   the context of new communications technology and the need for a proper
   balance between reputational interests and Internet expression. (C) 2015

Abstract = {Android is characterized by the complicated relations among its
   components and apps, through which one party interacts with the other
   (e.g., starting its activity) by referring to its attributes like
   package, activity, service, action names, authorities and permissions.
   Such relations can be easily compromised during a customization: e.g.,
   when an app is removed to fit an Android version to a new device model,
   while references to the app remain inside that OS. This conflict between
   the decentralized, unregulated Android customization process and the
   interdependency among different Android components and apps leads to the
   pervasiveness of hanging attribute references (Hares), a type of
   vulnerabilities never investigated before. In our research, we show that
   popular Android devices are riddled with such flaws, which often have
   serious security implications: when an attribute (e.g., a
   package/authority/action name) is used on a device but the party
   defining it has been removed, a malicious app can fill the gap to
   acquire critical system capabilities, by simply disguising as the owner
   of the attribute.
   More specifically, we discovered in our research that on various Android
   devices, the malware can exploit their Hares to steal the user's voice
   notes, control the screen unlock process, replace Google Email's account
   settings activity and collect or even modify the user's contact without
   proper permissions. We further designed and implemented Harehunter, a
   new tool for automatic detection of Hares by comparing attributes
   defined with those used, and analyzing the references to undefined
   attributes to determine whether they have been protected (e.g., by
   signature checking). On the factory images for 97 most popular Android
   devices, Harehunter discovered 21557 likely Hare flaws, demonstrating
   the significant impacts of the problem. To mitigate the hazards, we
   further developed an app for detecting the attempts to exploit Hares on
   different devices and provide the guidance for avoiding this pitfall
   when building future systems.},

   Reflection in the Diagnosis of Phishing Emails},
Journal = {AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {26},
Abstract = {The study aimed to examine the role of, and potential interplay between,
   cue utilisation and cognitive reflection in email users' ability to
   accurately (and efficiently) differentiate between phishing and genuine
   emails. 145 participants completed the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT),
   a phishing diagnostic task, and the Expert Intensive Skill Evaluation
   (EXPERTise 2.0) battery, which provided a gauge of users' cue
   utilisation in the domain. The results revealed an interaction between
   users' cognitive utilisation and cue reflection, whereby users low in
   both facets performed significantly worse in diagnosing phishing emails
   than all other groups. Further, those participants with both higher cue
   utilisation and cognitive reflection took significantly longer to make
   their diagnosis. It is concluded that a high level of cognitive
   reflection was able to compensate for a lower level of cue utilisation,
   and vice versa. Participants reported using seven types of cue during
   diagnosis, however, there was no significant relationship between the
   types of cues used and users' level of cue utilisation. Taken together,
   the findings have implications to the design of user-level interventions
   in relation to the identification of vulnerable users, as well as the
   need to consider training approaches that extend beyond the use of
   simple cue inventories.},

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY},

Volume = {71},

Abstract = {At present, existing multi-receiver authentication (MRA) schemes can
   only handle situations where the capacities of all receivers in the
   schemes are the same. However, in reality, different receivers may need
   to have different storage capacities. In this paper, inspired by the
   secret sharing scheme based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) for
   polynomial rings where each participant holds the share with different
   sizes, we propose three new constructions of unconditionally secure MRA
   schemes for multiple messages using the CRT for polynomial rings,
   including a (k, n)-threshold MRA scheme, a (k, n, w)-weighted threshold
   MRA scheme, and a (Q, F)-general MRA scheme. As far as we know, our
   proposed MRA schemes are the first MRA schemes with different storage
   capacities for different receivers and the first ones based on the CRT
   for polynomial rings. Moreover, the proposed schemes can be seen as
   extensions of the MRA scheme in Safavi-Naini and Wang. In particular, as
   for our (Q, F)-general MRA scheme, it has generally more communication
   complexity and much less computation complexity than the existing (Q,
   F)-general MRA scheme.},

Title = {Framework to assess the quality of mHealth apps: a mixed-method
   international case study protocol},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Introduction Healthcare professionals (HCPs) often recommend their
   patients to use a specific mHealth app as part of health promotion,
   disease prevention and patient self-management. There has been a
   significant growth in the number of HCPs downloading and using mobile
   health (mHealth) apps. Most mHealth apps that are available in app
   stores employ a `star rating' system. This is based on user feedback on
   an app, but is highly subjective. Thus, the identification of quality
   mHealth apps which are deemed fit for purpose can be a difficult task
   for HCPs. Currently, there is no unified, validated standard guidelines
   for assessment of mHealth apps for patient safety, which can be used by
   HCPs. The Modified Enlight Suite (MES) is a quality assessment framework
   designed to provide a means for HCPs to evaluate mHealth apps before
   they are recommended to patients. MES was adapted from the original
   Enlight Suite for international use through a Delphi method, followed by
   preliminary validation process among a population predominantly
   consisting of medical students. This study aims to evaluate the
   applicability and validity of the MES, by HCPs, in low, middle and high
   income country settings.
   Methods and analysis MES will be evaluated through a mixed-method study,
   consisting of qualitative (focus group) and quantitative (survey
   instruments) research, in three target countries: Malawi (low income),
   South Africa (middle income) and Ireland (high income). The focus groups
   will be conducted through Microsoft Teams (Microsoft, Redmond,
   Washington, USA) and surveys will be conducted online using Qualtrics
   (Qualtrics International, Seattle, Washington, USA). Participants will
   be recruited through the help of national representatives in Malawi

Abstract = {Phishing emails have permeated our digital communication, taking
   advantage of vulnerabilities that the information technology system
   poses to users. Given the potential for further cybersecurity incidents,
   theft of personally identifiable information, and damage to
   organizations' assets, cybersecurity professionals have implemented
   various mitigation practices to combat phishing emails. This paper
   categorizes current mitigation practices in relation to a sequential
   schema adopted from the situational crime prevention approach, so as to
   enable a more organized and strategic assessment of human and
   environmental vulnerabilities. Our model could be useful for
   cybersecurity professionals to further advance mitigation measures as an
   incident progresses and for criminologists and other academic
   researchers to reduce the severity of subsequent criminal incidents.},

Title = {Towards a New Energy Reserves Market: The Role of EV Aggregators},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {52176-52194},
Abstract = {The efficient participation of storage and demand aggregators in
   electricity markets is hindered by a misalignment between the markets'
   bidding language and these new players' technical characteristics.
   Specifically, we focus on day-ahead (DA) provision of frequency
   restoration reserves, where each market participant is asked to declare
   its reserve capacity for each timeslot of the following day. However,
   flexible assets bear cross-temporal characteristics (namely, limited
   energy) that cannot be communicated within the market's existing bidding
   language and may leave such assets unable to deliver their allocated
   reserves. To this end, this paper adopts a novel reserve product, termed
   Energy Reserves, which effectively addresses such service availability
   issues. Specifically, in this paper, we elaborate on how this product
   would enable Electric Vehicle (EV) aggregators to accurately communicate
   their flexibility capabilities to System Operators (SOs). We present the
   relevant mathematical formulations and illustrative examples of how the
   new framework would function. Furthermore, we present a Six-Criteria
   filtering method, through which the SO can pre-select which aggregators
   will be asked to contribute, so that the SO's administrative burden is
   drastically reduced. Our simulations demonstrate that this reduction in
   the communication overhead comes without an analogous reduction in the
   dispatch efficiency. Specifically, the 25\% of top-ranked EV aggregators
   can contribute, on average, to about 80\% of selected, real imbalance
   scenarios.},

Abstract = {In 2017, there were already 250 million unbanked people with a
   smartphone and internet access out of a total 1,7 billion, while only in
   2018, the volume of migrant remittance inflows for low-and middle-income
   countries was \$529 billion. Due to financial crisis leading to
   devaluation and hyperinflation, 12 countries (other than the USA) with
   40,5 million population already adopted the U.S. dollar as their native
   currency. Alternatively, Bitcoin usage soared among people in developing
   countries who are looking for dependable ways to store and transfer
   value. Bitcoin, with its estimated 25 million global users and ten
   thousand globally distributed nodes, is by far the most widely used,
   best understood and battle-tested cryptocurrency in the world to reach
   this financially excluded demographic.
   Our goal in this paper is to demonstrate a technical solution that
   utilizes Bitcoin by making it (a) instantly transferable in a
   user-friendly way, (b) with minimal (preferably zero) transaction fees
   and (c) without sacrificing users' security (i.e. by not controlling
   their private keys). In our design, instant transactions are enabled by
   using 2-of-2 multisignature wallet addresses (split between the user and
   the custodial) and transaction fees are minimized by aggregating unspent
   transaction outputs (UTXOs). On top of these two pure Bitcoin-based
   improvements, a fast and low-cost Bitcoin sending mechanism is proposed
   by creating a ``Bitcoin anchor{''} on Stellar platform, effectively
   using Stellar as a ``Layer 2{''} solution. Lastly, mapping Bitcoin
   addresses to user-friendly identifiers (such as email addresses) has
   been evaluated to increase adoption. By combining these new techniques,
   we aim to overcome the limitations of Bitcoin and related solutions like
   off-chain (Lightning Networks) or federated side-chain (Blockstream
   Liquid) systems.},

   architecture carried out through a PDE feature that has to be added to
   the existing application access tools like email clients and web
   browsers. A prototype has been developed to embody the PDE paradigm and
   to illustrate a scenario where such envelopes cross the boundaries of
   enterprise social networks and other communications tools. Preliminary
   performance evaluations were done helping the understanding of the PDE
   plug-in behaviors and computation overhead.},

Abstract = {We develop two social network based algorithms that automatically
   compute author reputation from a collection of textual documents. We
   first extract keyword reference behaviors of the authors to construct a
   social network, which represents relationships among the authors in
   terms of information reference behavior. With this network, we apply the
   two algorithms: the first computes each author's reputation value
   considering only direct reference and the second utilizes indirect
   reference recursively. We compare the reputation values computed by the
   two algorithms and reputation ratings given by a human domain expert. We
   further evaluate the algorithms in email categorization tasks by
   comparing them with machine learning techniques. Finally, we analyse the
   social network through a community detection algorithm and other
   analysis techniques. We observed several interesting phenomena including
   the network being scale-free and having a negative assortativity.},

Abstract = {In this work we expose wide-spread efforts by criminals to abuse the
   Chrome Web Store as a platform for distributing malicious extensions. A
   central component of our study is the design and implementation of
   WebEval, the first system that broadly identifies malicious extensions
   with a concrete, measurable detection rate of 96.5\%. Over the last
   three years we detected 9,523 malicious extensions: nearly 10\% of every
   extension submitted to the store. Despite a short window of operation we
   removed 50\% of malware within 25 minutes of creation a handful of under
   100 extensions escaped immediate detection and infected over 50 million
   Chrome users. Our results highlight that the extension abuse ecosystem
   is drastically different from malicious binaries: miscreants profit from
   web traffic and user tracking rather than email spam or banking theft.},

Abstract = {Over one million interactive whiteboards (IWBs) are sold annually
   worldwide, predominantly for classroom use with few sales for corporate
   use. Unmet needs for IWB corporate use were investigated and the
   CloudBoard Research Platform (CBRP) was developed to investigate and
   test technology for meeting these needs. The CBRP supports audio
   conferencing with shared remote drawing activity, casual capture of
   whiteboard activity for long-term storage and retrieval, use of standard
   formats such as PDF for easy import of documents via the web and email
   and easy export of documents. Company RFID badges and key fobs provide
   secure access to documents at the board and automatic logout occurs
   after a period of inactivity. Users manage their documents with a web
   browser. Analytics and remote device management is provided for
   administrators. The IWB hardware consists of off-the-shelf components (a
   Hitachi UST Projector, SMART Technologies, Inc. IWB hardware, Mac Mini,
   Polycom speakerphone, etc.) and a custom occupancy sensor. The three
   back-end servers provide the web interface, document storage, stroke and
   audio streaming. Ease of use, security, and robustness sufficient for
   internal adoption was achieved. Five of the 10 boards installed at
   various Ricoh sites have been in daily or weekly use for the past year
   and total system downtime was less than an hour in 2012. Since CBRP was
   installed, 65 registered users, 9 of whom use the system regularly, have
   created over 2600 documents.},

Title = {Challenges and solutions implementing an SMS text message-based survey
   CASI and adherence reminders in an international biomedical HIV PrEP

Abstract = {Background: We implemented a text message-based Short Message Service
   computer-assisted self-interviewing (SMS-CASI) system to aid adherence
   and monitor behavior in MTN-017, a phase 2 safety and acceptability
   study of rectally-applied reduced-glycerin 1\% tenofovir gel compared to
   oral emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets. We sought to
   implement SMS-based daily reminders and product use reporting, in four
   countries and five languages, and centralize data
   management/automated-backup.
   Methods: We assessed features of five SMS programs against study
   criteria. After identifying the optimal program, we systematically
   implemented it in South Africa, Thailand, Peru, and the United States.
   The system consisted of four windows-based computers, a GSM dongle and
   sim card to send SMS. The SMS-CASI was, designed for 160 character SMS.
   Reminders and reporting sessions were initiated by date/time triggered
   messages. System, questions, responses, and instructions were triggered
   by predetermined key words.
   Results: There were 142,177 total messages: sent 86,349 (60.73\%),
   received 55,573 (39.09\%), failed 255 (0.18\%). 6153 (4.33\%) of the
   message were errors generated from either our SMS-CASI system or by
   participants. Implementation challenges included: high message costs;
   poor data access; slow data cleaning and analysis; difficulty reporting
   information to sites; a need for better participant privacy and data
   security; and mitigating variability in system performance across sites.
   We mitigated message costs and poor data access by federating the
   SMS-CASI system, and used secure email protocols to centralize data
   backup. We developed programming syntaxes to facilitate daily data
   cleaning and analysis, and a calendar template for reporting SMS
   behavior. Lastly, we ambiguated text message language to increase
   privacy, and standardized hardware and software across sites, minimizing
   operational variability.
   Conclusion: We identified factors that aid international implementation
   and operation of SMS-CASI for real-time adherence monitoring. The
   challenges and solutions we present can aid other researchers to develop
   and manage an international multilingual SMS-based adherence reminder
   and CASI system.},

Abstract = {Internet excessive usage strongly affects health and wellbeing of modern
   peoples. Besides rapid communications and modern tools available using
   Internet, a growing global concern regarding Internet addiction has
   become a recognized problem. There is often confusion between an
   excessive usage and addiction, as a mental disorder. New reports show
   that an average Internet user spends more than a day in a week in front
   of a screen and more time using mobile devices than watching TV. This
   paper provides new approaches regarding the general spectrum of Internet
   usage. It also presents software applications, as important tools, that
   can manage the total spent time using Internet, including websites
   navigation, social media applications, email usage or smart phones.
   Information about the total spent time on Internet for an average user
   and the calculated frequency of mobile devices usage have been collected
   from main electronic databases, published papers, global statistics or
   authors experience and were included in this paper. Some other linked
   problems such as privacy, security or hardware requirements are also
   considered. Overall, this paper highlights a modern problem and
   indicates some new tools in order to help specialists or common users to
   improve their activity.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces a novel algorithm, UDmap, to identify dynamically
   assigned IP addresses and analyze their dynamics pattern. UDmap is fully
   automatic, and relies only on application-level server logs. We applied
   UDmap to a month-long Hotmail user-login trace and identified a
   significant number of dynamic IP addresses - more than 102 million. This
   suggests that the fraction of IP addresses that are dynamic is by no
   means negligible. Using this information in combination with a
   three-month Hotmail email server log, we were able to establish that
   95.6\% of mail servers setup on the dynamic IP addresses in our trace
   sent out solely spam emails. Moreover, these mail servers sent out a
   large amount of spam - amounting to 42.2\% of all spam emails received
   by Hotmail. These results highlight the importance of being able to
   accurately identify dynamic IP addresses for spam filtering. We expect
   similar benefits to arise for phishing site identification and botnet
   detection. To our knowledge, this is the first successful attempt to
   automatically identify and understand IP address dynamics.},

Title = {An Orthogonality-Based Dual-Memory Framework for Continual Text
   Classification},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUDIO SPEECH AND LANGUAGE PROCESSING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {33},
Pages = {2444-2456},
Abstract = {Continual text classification has played an increasingly important role
   in real-world applications, which focus on classifying the constantly
   emerging texts over time. Although many efforts have been made to
   overcome the major challenge of continual learning (CL), i.e.,
   catastrophic forgetting (CF), the existing CL methods ignore the
   underlying interference among different tasks and still suffer from the
   CF issue. To get a deeper insight into CF, in this paper, we make the
   first attempt to study the relationship between forgetting and
   representation similarity in continual text classification tasks. Our
   thorough analyses of both real-world and pseudo datasets, for the
   pre-trained language model (PLM) based methods, demonstrate that
   forgetting can be effectively alleviated by reducing the similarity of
   the representations of different datasets. Based on our findings, we
   develop a novel Orthogonality-based Dual-memory Framework (Org-Frame),
   which is able to minimize the interference among different tasks via a
   two-stage learning process analogous to the human memory system.
   Org-Frame can also be combined with the LoRA fine-tuning method to
   enhance the continual learning capability of large language models
   (LLMs). Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale benchmarks using
   BERT and LLaMA demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our
   proposed framework in continual text classification tasks.},

Abstract = {Most of the modern web services offer their users the ability to be
   registered on them via dedicated registration pages. Most of the times,
   they use this method so the users can profit by accessing more content
   or privileged items. In these pages, users are typically requested to
   provide their names, email addresses, phone numbers and other personal
   information in order to create an account. As the purpose of the
   tracking ecosystem is to collect as many information and data from the
   user, this kind of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) might leak
   on the 3rd-Parties, when the users fill in the registration forms. In
   this work, we conduct a large-scale measurement analysis of the PII
   leakage via registration pages of the 200,000 most popular websites. We
   design and implement a scalable and easily replicable methodology, for
   detecting and filling registration forms in an automated way. Our
   analysis shows that a number of websites (approximate to 5\%) leak PIIs
   to 3rd-Party trackers without any user's consent, in a non-transparent
   fashion. Furthermore, we explore the techniques employed by 3rd-Parties
   in order to harvest user's data, and we highlight the implications on
   user's privacy.},

Abstract = {Email spam is the most effective form of online advertising. Unlike
   telephone marketing, email spamming does not require huge human or
   financial resources investment. Most existing spam filtering techniques
   concentrate on the emails' content. However, most spammers obfuscate
   their emails' content to circumvent content-based spam filters. An
   integrated solution for restricting spam emails is needed as content
   analyses alone might not provide a solution for filtering unsolicited
   emails. Here we present a new method for isolating unsolicited emails.
   Though spammers obfuscate their emails' content, they do not have access
   to all the fields in the email header. Our classification method is
   based on the path an email traverses instead of content. Overall, our
   classifier produced fewer false positives when compared to current
   filters such as SpamAssassin. We achieved a precision of 98.65\% which
   compares well with the precisions achieved by SPF, DNSRBL blacklists.},

Abstract = {In the present situation, the issue of identifying spammers has received
   increasing attention because of its practical relevance in the field of
   social network analysis. The growing popularity of social networking
   sites has made them prime targets for spammers. By allowing users to
   publicize and share their independently generated content, online social
   networks become susceptible to different types of malicious and
   opportunistic user actions. Social network community users are fed with
   irrelevant information while surfing, due to spammer's activity. Spam
   pervades any information system such as email or Web, social, blog, or
   reviews platform. Therefore, this paper attempts to review various spam
   detection frameworks that which deal about the detection and elimination
   of spams in various sources.},

Abstract = {In recent Android versions, access to various (unique) identifiers has
   been restricted or completely removed for third-party applications.
   However, many information sources can still be combined to create a
   fingerprint, effectively substituting the need for these unique
   identifiers. Until now, finding these fingerprintable sources required
   manually sifting through the API documentation to identify each
   information source individually. This paper presents AndroPRINT, a
   framework that automatically recognizes fingerprintable information
   sources on Android devices. For this purpose it automatically invokes
   methods, queries fields, and retrieves data from content providers. We
   show that this framework allows automating the elaborate task of finding
   such fingerprintable information sources in different experiments. In
   these experiments, a variety of information sources could be identified,
   which provide a vast amount of unique features for fingerprinting.
   Furthermore, AndroPRINT detected undocumented unique device
   identification features, which are a result of manufacturer adaptations.
   These vendor customisations even revealed personal data, such as the
   user's email address and cryptographic keys used for cross-device
   communication. The fact that this information can be retrieved without
   the user noticing means that vendor customisations can effectively
   defeat the tight permission system of modern smartphone operating
   systems.},

Abstract = {This paper presents on development of an accident reporting system using
   an iOS application. Normally, accidents at workplace could only be
   reported on a standard paper form but there are often delays in
   submitting the reports, as well as difficulties in retrieving them back
   for analyzing purposes. Additionally, reporting via paper format
   consumes paper resources, which is not environmental friendly. The iOS
   accident reporting system application was developed using Xcode SDK 5.1,
   focusing on device with iOS 7 as their operating system. The mobile
   application allows user with iOS devices such as iPhone or iPad, to
   report occupational accidents, quickly. The report is sent email to the
   Safety and Health Officer. Hence, this application makes accident
   reporting task become more efficient and effective, for immediate action
   to be taken.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a content-based image retrieval system for mobile
   phones, named MOSIR. The system facilitates instantaneous search on
   mobile phones for images similar to photos taken via phone cameras.
   Edge-based and color-layout features are used to find similar images.
   The system also enables region-based queries by detecting salient
   regions and extracting their features. To overcome security problems,
   the system applies both self-defined email and web application software.
   The system overcomes limitation of display panels and control key in
   common mobile phones by using Flash-Lite as a new user interface
   approach to view images of different sizes and contexts. The system was
   tested with 2,250 images, and results were satisfying. Therefore, MOSIR
   is a promising system to perform instant image search on mobile phones.
   Currently, it is targeted for common mobile phones. Eventually, MOSIR is
   aimed to support smart phones and retrieval of semantically related
   information to resulted images.},

Abstract = {Establishing trust between a group of individuals remains a difficult
   problem. Prior works assume trusted infrastructure, require an
   individual to trust unknown entities, or provide relatively low
   probabilistic guarantees of authenticity (95\% for realistic settings).
   This work presents SPATE, a primitive that allows users to establish
   trust via device mobility and physical interaction. Once the SPATE,
   protocol runs to completion, its participants' mobile devices have
   authentic data that their applications can use to interact securely
   (i.e, the probability of a successful attack is 2(-24)). For this work,
   we leverage SPATE as part of a larger system to facilitate efficient,
   secure, and user-friendly collaboration via email and file-sharing
   services. Our implementation of SPATE on Nokia N70 smartphones allows
   users to establish trust in small groups of up to eight users in less
   than one minute. The two example SPATE applications provide increased
   security with no overhead noticeable to users once keys are established.},

Abstract = {Data auditing contributes to checking the integrity of outsourced data,
   promoting the vigorous development of cloud storage services. In actual
   scenarios, such as migration of electronic medical records or data
   transfer of enterprise mergers and acquisitions, it always require data
   auditing to help clients with dynamic data migration and integrity
   checking. In this paper, we present an efficient dynamic certificateless
   outsourced data auditing mechanism supporting multi-ownership transfer
   (CDA-MOT), addressing the issue of key escrow and without needing
   complex certificate management. By integrating a certificateless
   multi-signature on the same data file into the construction of a
   homomorphic authenticator based on the Lagrange inverse Multinomial
   theorem, CDA-MOT not only achieves integrity verification but also
   enables clients to transfer ownership rights and responsibilities for
   multi-ownership data in collaboration with cloud servers. Utilizing
   blockchain systems to store necessary data conversion and update
   records, as well as smart contracts to fulfill auditing tasks, CDA-MOT
   owns the characteristics of openness, transparency, accountability, and
   decentralized public auditing. Besides, CDA-MOT could be further applied
   in the extension of dynamic update operations, even if outsourced data
   have been transferred. The security analysis and performance evaluation
   have demonstrated the feasibility of CDA-MOT in the secure deployment of
   cloud storage.},

   we have a chatbot algorithm such that the user can text information to
   control the functioning of the electrical appliances at home. The
   messages sent using the chatbot is processed using Natural Language
   processing techniques. Secondly, any device connected to the local area
   network of the house can control the devices and other appliances in the
   house. Thirdly, the web application used to enable home automation also
   has a security feature that only enables certain users to access the
   application. And finally, it also has a functionality of sending an
   email alert when intruder is detected using motion sensors.},

Abstract = {A new library of modular arithmetic and cryptographic functions was
   coded, and then used for the development of a crypto tool. We present
   the architecture and functionality of a hybrid ECC-AES cryptosystem
   which can be quickly deployed even in absence of Public Key
   Infrastructures and associated Certification Authorities. The tool was
   conceived for use in combination with readily available resources, e.g.
   email and possibly social networks. It allows secure exchange of files
   with associated ECDSA digital signature, providing the user with
   substantial flexibility and control of the security settings.
   Established protocols were used in an original way, notably exploiting
   direct embedding of the AES session key into an elliptic curve. The code
   has been developed in C++ entirely from scratch, with no use of
   pre-existing libraries. The implementation is associated with a web site
   http://www.elcrypto.com, www.elcrypto.com aimed at promoting the
   benefits of Elliptic Curve Cryptography.},

Abstract = {Introduction Despite the current opioid crisis resulting in tens of
   thousands of deaths every year, buprenorphine, a medication that can
   reduce opioid-related mortality, withdrawal, drug use and craving, is
   still underprescribed in the emergency department (ED) for treatment of
   opioid use disorder (OUD). The EMergency department-initiated
   BuprenorphinE for opioid use Disorder (EMBED) trial introduced a
   clinical decision support (CDS) tool that improved the proportion of ED
   physicians prescribing buprenorphine but did not affect patient-level
   rates of buprenorphine initiation. The present trial aims to build on
   these findings by optimising CDS use through iterative improvements,
   refined interventions and clinician feedback to enhance OUD treatment
   initiation in EDs.Methods and analysis The Adaptive Decision support for
   Addiction Treatment (ADAPT) trial employs the Multiphase Optimization
   Strategy (MOST) framework to refine a multicomponent CDS tool designed
   to facilitate buprenorphine initiation for OUD in ED settings. Using a
   pragmatic, learning health system approach in three phases, the trial
   applies plan-do-study-act cycles for continuous CDS refinement. The CDS
   will be updated in the preparation phase to reflect new evidence. The
   optimisation phase will include a 2x2x2 factorial trial, testing the
   impact of various intervention components, followed by rapid, serial
   randomised usability testing to reduce user errors and enhance CDS
   workflow efficiency. In the evaluation phase, the optimised CDS package
   will be tested in a randomised trial to assess its effectiveness in
   increasing ED initiation of buprenorphine compared with the original
   EMBED CDS.Ethics and dissemination The protocol has received approval
   from our institution's institutional review board (protocol
   \#2000038624) with a waiver of informed consent for collecting
   non-identifiable information only. Given the minimal risk involved in
   implementing established best practices, an independent study monitor
   will oversee the study instead of a Data Safety Monitoring Board.
   Findings will be submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov, published in
   open-access, peer-reviewed journals, presented at national conferences
   and shared with clinicians at participating sites through email
   notification.Trial registration number NCT06799117.},

Title = {Knowledge-Driven Lane Change Prediction for Secure and Reliable Internet
   of Vehicles},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 FEB 5},
Abstract = {Ensuring the smooth operation of road traffic is a momentous target in
   Intelligent Transportation Systems, which can be expedited by a secure
   and reliable Internet of Vehicles (IoV). As prominent carriers of the
   IoV, intelligent vehicles (IVs), that bear the promising potential for
   alleviating traffic congestion, have become the core road traffic
   participants. However, the mixed-traffic environment escalates the risk
   of IVs, as the discretionary lane change behaviors of nearby
   human-driven vehicles may result in collisions with IVs, compromising
   the robust performance of the IoV. Recent studies have utilized advanced
   deep learning techniques to achieve proactive lane change intention
   prediction, including Recurrent Neural Networks and Transformer.
   Although attaining reasonable prediction performance, they adopt the
   data-driven paradigm, which excessively focuses on learning from data
   while neglecting the domain knowledge. Against this background, we
   propose to employ the knowledge-driven paradigm and design KLEP, a
   knowledge-driven lane change prediction framework. KLEP incorporates
   driving knowledge into lane change modeling, presenting the top-down
   hierarchical cognitive process of drivers when performing lane change
   maneuvers. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world natural
   driving datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of KLEP. Compared to
   state-of-the-art lane change prediction baselines, KLEP consistently
   outperforms them and achieves average improvements of 6.2-7.1\% and
   53.0-67.2\% on intention classification and intention forecast tasks
   across different datasets, respectively. We also validate that KLEP has
   strong interpretability that aligns with real-world physical laws in
   lane change scenarios and is lightweight enough to fulfill online
   prediction.},

Title = {Exploring customer attitude towards neo-banking apps: a thematic
   analysis using Google Play and Apple App Store reviews},
Journal = {QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN FINANCIAL MARKETS},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JUL 3},
Abstract = {PurposeFinancial services have radically transformed in this digital
   age, and digital technologies are increasingly embraced. This pioneering
   study, the first of its kind, seeks to conduct a comprehensive review
   and analysis of the key factors that influence customer attitudes
   towards neo-banking applications. Furthermore, it aims to compare the
   user experience of Android and iOS neo-banking users by leveraging
   customer reviews from the Google Play Store and Apple App
   Store.Design/methodology/approachThe authors meticulously analysed user
   reviews from six popular banking apps to achieve the research objective.
   The authors used text mining and thematic analysis to extract and
   categorise the user feedback. The qualitative data was processed using
   the NVIVO survey tool, a reliable and widely used method, ensuring a
   rigorous and systematic analysis of unstructured qualitative
   data.FindingsThe study revealed that web features, customer support
   systems, privacy and security concerns, ease of use and overall app
   usefulness significantly influence customer attitudes towards neobanks.
   Notably, security and customer support systems emerged as paramount
   consumer concerns in the neo-banking landscape. The findings indicate a
   substantial disparity in the user experience between Android and iOS
   users. Customer reviews from Android users are predominantly favourable
   towards neobanks, whereas iOS users express considerable dissatisfaction
   with the services most neobanks provide.Research
   limitations/implicationsThis study significantly contributes to the
   neo-banking literature, a sector that remains underexplored despite the
   increasing adoption rate. While previous studies focused on mobile
   banking adoption using quantitative survey methods, the study used a
   qualitative text-mining approach and thematic analysis, allowing for a
   detailed understanding of customer attitudes. Although text mining has
   been applied in other domains, its use in neo-banking services is still
   limited. This study demonstrates how text mining and thematic analysis
   can be leveraged to extract meaningful concepts from unstructured
   consumer reviews. Previous banking studies rely on models such as
   technology acceptance models and unified theory of acceptance and use of
   technology, which can explain the adoption behaviour but may not fully
   capture attitudinal factors. This research extends the scope of
   neo-banking literature by incorporating consumer-generated insights
   through text mining. It enhances the existing knowledge of neobanking by
   highlighting the distinct experiences of Android and iOS users. This
   study addresses a gap in previous research by covering reviews from the
   Apple App Store. It includes reviews in Hindi to understand better the
   customer base that prefers expressing their emotions in Hindi. By doing
   so, this is revealed to be the first study of its kind, uncovering
   differences in user experience and satisfaction levels between Android
   and iOS users for the same applications. It demonstrates the necessity
   for further research into platformspecific user experiences,
   particularly in the context of emerging technologies in digital banking.
   Identifying critical success factors and inhibitors influencing
   attitudes towards neo-banking applications lays a foundation for future
   research. It encourages scholars to explore disparities in user
   behaviour and preferences in digital banking as this field
   evolves.Practical implicationsThese insights include strengths and areas
   for enhancement, particularly in user experience, customer support and
   feature optimisation.
   The reviews indicate a strong need for a user-friendly interface.
   Android Users express satisfaction with the app design, while iOS users
   report issues with the user interface, including glitches, bugs and
   compatibility problems. This indicates addressing specific complaints
   aboutmisalignment of UI with iPhone margins and ensuring the navigation
   elements are easily accessible. The customer support system turns out to
   be a crucial area for improvement. As neobanks are entirely online, the
   need for strong customer support becomes essential. Many iOS users
   report frustration with the app's support system, mentioning issues such
   as unresponsive chat support, lack of human assistance and unresolved
   queries. Managers should prioritise enhancing customer support
   infrastructure by providing more accessible live chat with human
   representatives, clear communication channels and quick response time.
   Managers should prioritise providing users with accessible options to
   ask queries beyond the fixed questions in chatbots. While chatbots can
   handle common queries, many users need personalised assistance.
   Implementing a multitiered support system with email support and
   dedicated helplines can significantly improve user satisfaction and
   trust levels in biobanking services. The review highlights the
   persistent problem with the Video Know Your Customer (KYC) verification
   process, particularly for iOS users. These delays and complications in
   verification can block potential customers and lead to dissatisfaction
   among existing ones. Managers should streamline the KYC process by
   leveraging advanced technologies to automate and expedite verification
   steps. Facilitating clear communication with customers regarding the
   process and potential issues can help minimise user frustration and
   improve satisfaction. Managers should consider developing educational
   content and gamified features that cater to younger users' needs, which
   eventually enhance the financial literacy of this engaging demography.
   Users express a strong desire for security measures in the applications.
   In contrast, many users feel confident in the app's security, and
   various feedback shows concerns about freezing and blocking their
   accounts, mainly iOS users' accounts. Implementing biometric
   authentication and app closure features while entering any unsecured
   network can enhance user trust and security. Some users also reported
   limitations regarding location access, which affects the ability of the
   app features. Managers should observe the geographical availability of
   services and expand them in underserved areas. This can be done by
   partnering with regional traditional banks to serve a broader customer
   base. Finally, during the review analysis, it was observed that very few
   neobanks bother replying to app store customer feedback. Establishing a
   continuous feedback loop with customers can provide valuable insight for
   continuous improvements. Implementing a robust tracking of customer
   issues on all platforms can enhance user satisfaction.Social
   implicationsThe rise of neobanks has broader implications for financial
   inclusion, financial literacy, consumer empowerment and digital
   literacy. By removing physical barriers, neobanks can bring unbanked and
   underbanked populations into the financial ecosystem. The positive
   feedback from users, especially younger ones, indicates that neobanks
   can be crucial in introducing financial services to demographics often
   ignored by traditional banks.
   Neo-banking can bridge the financial gaps between urban and rural
   populations, provided that challenges such as internet connectivity and
   smartphone accessibility are addressed. The advancement of neobanks
   signifies a shift in the banking landscape, challenging traditional
   banking models. Young individuals gravitate towards digital-only
   banking, which can increase competition, driving innovation and service
   improvement across the banking industry. The focus on financial literacy
   in user reviews suggests a growing societal requirement for educational
   resources on their platforms; neobanks can help users develop essential
   financial skills such as budgeting, saving, making mindful investments
   and responsible spending. This will contribute towards a financially
   literate society and improve overall financial well-being. Finally, the
   ability of neobanks to provide convenient banking solutions can help
   address broader societal challenges, such as the need for a fast and
   reliable payment system in a cashless economy; by facilitating financial
   management, neobanks can contribute to the modernisation of the fintech
   ecosystem and promote economic growth and
   stability.Originality/valueThis study is a pioneering effort, delving
   into India's app-based reviews of neo-banking services. It offers a
   unique perspective on the user experience of Android and iOS users. The
   findings, which hold significant implications for the banking and
   technology industry, provide a deeper understanding of customer
   attitudes, thereby shaping the future of digital banking.},

Title = {In India, most principal investigators have run very few trials over the
   years},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Month = {AUG 7},
Abstract = {Background In the past, clinical trials run in India have been the
   subject of criticism. Among other steps to improve the trial ecosystem,
   for some time the government limited the number of trials that a
   Principal Investigator (PI) could run to three at a time. We were
   interested to know how many trials PIs in India tend to run at a
   time.Methods We accessed the 52,149 trial records hosted by the Clinical
   Trials Registry-India in April 2023. Of these, we shortlisted trials
   that had run in India, were interventional, and involved certain
   interventions such as drug, biological etc. We used multiple parameters,
   such as email ID, phone number etc. to determine whether one name always
   represented the same PI and whether two names corresponded to the same
   PI. We then determined how many trials each PI had run.Results We found
   that 3,916 unique PI names were associated with 6,665 trials. Of these,
   2,963 (75.7\%) PIs had run a single study. Only 251 (6.4\%) had run more
   than three trials. A mere 14 PIs had run 20 or more trials. The 14 PIs
   were affiliated with local pharma companies (6), local or global
   contract research organizations (4), multinational pharma companies (3)
   and the Central Council for Research in Homeopathy (1). The maximum
   number of trials run by a single PI was 108. Of these, the largest
   number run in a single year, 2022, was 53.Conclusion Each PI name needs
   to be connected to a unique ID that does not change with time, so that
   it is easier to track the number of trials that a given PI has run. The
   number of studies run by a given PI at a given time must not be
   excessive and needs to be monitored more actively. The government needs
   to consider whether a cap on the number of trials that a PI runs at a
   time is required and what infrastructure needs to be in place to
   facilitate higher numbers of trials. Trial registry records need to be
   updated more regularly. Other countries may wish to do likewise.},

Title = {Don't click: towards an effective anti-phishing training. A comparative
   literature review},
Journal = {HUMAN-CENTRIC COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Email is of critical importance as a communication channel for both
   business and personal matters. Unfortunately, it is also often exploited
   for phishing attacks. To defend against such threats, many organizations
   have begun to provide anti-phishing training programs to their
   employees. A central question in the development of such programs is how
   they can be designed sustainably and effectively to minimize the
   vulnerability of employees to phishing attacks. In this paper, we survey
   and categorize works that consider different elements of such programs
   via a clearly laid-out methodology, and identify key findings in the
   technical literature. Overall, we find that researchers agree on the
   answers to many relevant questions regarding the utility and
   effectiveness of anti-phishing training. However, we identified
   influencing factors, such as the impact of age on the success of
   anti-phishing training programs, for which mixed findings are available.
   Finally, based on our comprehensive analysis, we describe how a
   well-founded anti-phishing training program should be designed and
   parameterized with a set of proposed research directions.},

Abstract = {The age of depending on processing devices has passed, the current life
   style is more dependent on continuous connectivity to the cyber space.
   This requires exceeding connectivity being a need to service providers
   such as businesses and companies to become a need for service consumers
   to maintain the services. Perhaps one of the most popular tools to
   achieve this degree of connectivity are mobile devices, with their
   ``anytime, anywhere{''} characteristics, thus providing connectivity and
   ensuring mobility. This characteristic comes with inherited risks from
   both mobility and connectivity. Therefore, efforts have been focused on
   providing added layers of security for mobile environment, thus causing
   an additional security measures that subsequently adds more
   complications to the environment. This research provides a secure mobile
   environment with a simple nonevasive biometric authentication,
   represented by face recognition, a backup security layer is provided,
   represented by a graphical password, if the user fails to unlock with
   the face recognition feature, the graphical password option can be used.
   At the same time, if any intruder tries to unlock and fails the third
   time, the system will capture the face and send it to a pre-defined
   email automatically; thus the suggested method provides an
   authentication mechanism that is suitable for daily use, at the same
   time can serve with high efficiency for users with disability or special
   needs. The choice of the backup authentication is also designed to take
   in consideration the needs of such users' categories.},

Abstract = {Today, Single Sign-On (SSO) is omnipresent on the Internet. Every day,
   millions of users utilize SSO protocols such as OAuth 2.0 (OAuth) or
   OpenID Connect 1.0 (OIDC). These protocols allow users to log in to
   multiple websites or services, called Relying Partys (RPs), using their
   accounts from major Identity Providers (IdPs) such as Apple, Facebook,
   and Google. Consequently, these IdPs gain the ability to track their
   users across the Internet. In return, RPs gain access to an enriched set
   of the user's personal data stored at the IdP, including names, email
   addresses, and profile pictures.
   In this paper, we present three novel SSO privacy leaks found in the
   wild. Contrary to prior work, our leaks occur automatically as soon as
   the user visits the RP, without their consent or awareness, in a
   non-transparent manner. To prove their prevalence, we conducted a
   large-scale study on the Tranco top 1M websites. Our measurement shows
   that 10,931 RPs automatically leak the user's identity, the currently
   visited RP, and other metadata (e.g., time of access) to the IdPs
   (partial leak). Additionally, 2,947 RPs silently deanonymize users,
   logging them into their accounts without their awareness (full leak).
   Even worse, 6 RPs leak the user's identity to third parties (escalated
   leak). Besides 4 major IdPs, including Facebook and Google, we
   identified privacy leaks affecting 1,032 additional, less-popular IdPs.
   Conversely, 7 IdPs, including Apple and Github, are exemplary in
   avoiding these leaks.
   To protect users, we present our browser extension called SSO PRIVACY
   GUARD. We demonstrate its effectiveness in preventing all the identified
   leaks. Furthermore, we discuss if and how emerging initiatives by major
   browser vendors related to tracking prevention can also improve privacy
   in the SSO ecosystem. To promote reproducibility, we publicly release
   the source code and all artifacts, and we plan to release SSO PRIVACY
   GUARD in the official Chrome and Firefox extension stores.},

Abstract = {Initial research on using crowdsourcing as a collaborative method for
   helping individuals identify phishing messages has shown promising
   results. However, the vast majority of crowdsourcing research has
   focussed on crowdsourced system components broadly and understanding
   individuals' motivation in contributing to crowdsourced systems. Little
   research has examined the features of crowdsourced systems that
   influence whether individuals utilise this information, particularly in
   the context of warnings for phishing emails. Thus, the present study
   examined four features related to warnings derived from a mock
   crowdsourced anti-phishing warning system that 438 participants were
   provided to aid in their evaluation of a series of email messages: the
   number of times an email message was reported as being potentially
   suspicious, the source of the reports, the accuracy rate of the warnings
   (based on reports) and the disclosure of the accuracy rate. The results
   showed that crowdsourcing features work together to encourage warning
   acceptance and reduce anxiety. Accuracy rate demonstrated the most
   prominent effects on outcomes related to judgement accuracy, adherence
   to warning recommendations and anxiety with system use. The results are
   discussed regarding implications for organisations considering the
   design and implementation of crowdsourced phishing warning systems that
   facilitate accurate recommendations.},

Abstract = {In this paper we investigate new mechanisms for achieving forward secure
   encryption in store and forward messaging systems such as email and SMS.
   In a forward secure encryption scheme, a user periodically updates her
   secret key so that past messages remain confidential in the event that
   her key is compromised. A primary contribution of our work is to
   introduce a new form of encryption that we name puncturable encryption.
   Using a puncturable encryption scheme, recipients may repeatedly update
   their decryption keys to revoke decryption capability for selected
   messages, recipients or time periods. Most importantly, this update
   process does not require the recipients to communicate with or
   distribute new key material to senders. We show how to combine
   puncturable encryption with the forward-secure public key encryption
   proposal of Canetti et al. to achieve practical forward-secure messaging
   with low overhead. We implement our schemes and provide experimental
   evidence that the new constructions are practical.},

Abstract = {The Internet was introduced to connect computers and allow communication
   between these computers. It evolved to provide applications such as
   email, talk and file sharing with the associated system to search. The
   files were made available, freely, by users. However, the internet was
   out of the reach of most people since it required equipment and know-how
   as well as connection to a computer on the Internet. One method of
   connection used an acoustic coupler and an analog phone. With the
   introduction of the personal computer and higher speed modems, accessing
   the internet became easier. The introduction of user-friendly graphical
   interfaces, as well as the convenience and portablility of laptops and
   smartphones made the internet much more widely accessible for a broad
   swath of users. A small number of newly established companies, supported
   by a large amount of venture capital and a lack of regulation have since
   established a stranglehold on the Internet with billions of people using
   these applications. Their monopolistic practices and exploitation of the
   open nature of the Internet has created a need in the ordinary person to
   replace the traditional way of communication with what they provide: in
   exchange for giving up personal information these persons have become
   dependent on the service provided. Due to the regulatory desert around
   privacy and ownership of personal electornic data, a handful of massive
   corporations have expropriated and exploited aggregated and
   disaggregated personal information. This amounts, we argue, to the
   colonization of the Internet.},

Abstract = {One of the most severe and challenging threats to Internet security is
   phishing, which uses spoofed websites to steal users' passwords and
   online identities. Phishers mainly use spoofed emails or instant
   messages to lure users to the phishing websites. A spoofed email or
   instant message provides the first-layer context to entice users to
   click on a phishing URL, and the phishing website further provides the
   second-layer context with the look and feel similar to a targeted
   legitimate website to lure users to submit their login credentials. In
   this paper, we focus on the second-layer context to explore the extreme
   of phishing attacks; we explore the feasibility of creating extreme
   phishing attacks that have the almost identical look and feel as those
   of the targeted legitimate websites, and evaluate the effectiveness of
   such phishing attacks. We design and implement a phishing toolkit that
   can support both the traditional phishing and the newly emergent Web
   Single Sign-On (SSO) phishing; our toolkit can automatically construct
   unlimited levels of phishing webpages in real time based on user
   interactions. We design and perform a user study to evaluate the
   effectiveness of the phishing attacks constructed from this toolkit. The
   user study results demonstrate that extreme phishing attacks are indeed
   highly effective and insidious. It is reasonable to assume that extreme
   phishing attacks will be widely adopted and deployed in the future, and
   we call for a collective effort to effectively defend against them.},

Abstract = {Recent years have seen increasing volumes of data generated by online
   systems, such as internet logs, physical access logs, transaction
   records, email and phone records. These contain multiple overlapping
   sequences of events related to different individuals and entities.
   Information that can be mined from these event sequences is an important
   resource in understanding current behaviour, predicting future behaviour
   and identifying non-standard patterns and possible security breaches.
   Statistical machine learning approaches have had some success but do not
   allow human insight to be included easily. We have recently presented a
   framework for representing sequences of related events, with scope for
   assistance from human experts. This paper describes the framework and
   presents a new algorithm which (i) allows the addition of new event
   sequences as they are identified from data or postulated by a human
   analyst, and (ii) allows subtraction/removal of sequences that are no
   longer relevant. Examination of the sequences can be used to further
   refine and modify general patterns of events.},

Title = {Harm reduction readiness for illicit IV drug use among safety-net
   primary care practices in the San Fernando Valley},
Journal = {ARCHIVES OF PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {80},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 6},
Abstract = {Background Harm reduction is an accumulation of strategies aimed at
   preventing adverse health outcomes associated with illicit substance
   use. Several harm reduction programs and services exist within Los
   Angeles County (LAC), however their success relies in part on the
   application of harm reduction principles by local primary care providers
   serving patients with substance use disorders. This study aims to assess
   the readiness of patient-centered medical homes in the San Fernando
   Valley to provide effective harm reduction to patients who use injection
   drugs and identify barriers to doing so. Methods An online survey was
   distributed to primary care providers and social workers via email at
   federally qualified health centers and LAC Department of Health Services
   clinics in the San Fernando Valley between May and June 2019. It
   consisted of 22 multiple-choice, Likert scale, and short answer
   questions. The survey assessed knowledge of injection drug use (IDU),
   familiarity and utilization of harm-reduction and resources, and
   self-evaluation of attitudes and skills. Results There were a total of
   41 survey respondents across all clinics. Of respondents, 98\% correctly
   identified heroin as a drug typically injected, and 93\% identified
   Hepatitis C as an infectious risk of IDU. 63\% of respondents use harm
   reduction strategies every few months or less. 34\% prescribe
   buprenorphine routinely, and 76\% prescribe pre-exposure prophylaxis to
   those at risk for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). 76\% are
   comfortable discussing IDU with their patients, but 59\% indicate that
   they lack the necessary skills, and 42\% agree that they lack the time
   to address it. Conclusion Knowledge of IDU was adequate among those
   surveyed, although overall utilization of harm reduction was infrequent.
   There is a perceived deficit in skills and time to effectively provide
   harm reduction to primary care patients in the San Fernando Valley.},

Title = {Development of Promising Interventions to Improve HumanPapillomavirus
   Vaccination in a School-Based Program in Quebec,Canada:Results From a
   Formative Evaluation Using a MixedMethods Design},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {8},
Abstract = {Background: Despite the availability of school-based human
   papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programs, disparities in vaccine
   coverage persist. Barriers to HPV vaccine acceptance and uptake include
   parental attitudes, knowledge, beliefs, and system-level barriers. A
   total of 3 interventions were developed to address these barriers: an
   in-person presentation by school nurses, an email reminder with a
   web-based information and decision aid tool, and a telephone reminder
   using motivational interviewing (MI) techniques. Objective: Here we
   report on the development and formative evaluation of interventions to
   improve HPV vaccine acceptance and uptake among grade 4 students'
   parents in Quebec, Canada. Methods: In the summer of 2019, we conducted
   a formative evaluation of the interventions to assess the interventions'
   relevance, content, and format and to identify any unmet needs. We
   conducted 3 focus group discussions with parents of grade 3 students and
   nurses. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for thematic
   content using NVivo software (Lumivero). Nurses received training on MI
   techniques and we evaluated the effect on nurses' knowledge and skills
   using a pre-post questionnaire. Descriptive quantitative analyses were
   carried out on data from questionnaires relating to the training.
   Comparisons were made using the proportions of the results. Finally, we
   developed a patient decision aid using an iterative, user-centered
   design process. The iterative refinement process involved feedback from
   parents, nurses, and experts to ensure the tool's relevance and
   effectiveness. The evaluation protocol and data collection tools were
   approved by the CHU (Centre Hospitalier Universitaire) de Qu \&
   eacute;bec Research Ethics Committee (MP-20-2019-4655, May 16, 2019).
   Results: The data collection was conducted from April 2019 to March
   2021. Following feedback (n=28) from the 3 focus group discussions in
   June 2019, several changes were made to the in-person presentation
   intervention. Experts (n=27) and school nurses (n=29) recruited for the
   project appreciated the visual and simplified information on vaccination
   in it. The results of the MI training for school nurses conducted in
   August 2019 demonstrated an increase in the skills and knowledge of
   nurses (n=29). School nurses who took the web-based course (n=24) filled
   out a pretest and posttest questionnaire to evaluate their learning. The
   rating increased by 19\% between the pretest and posttest
   questionnaires. Several changes were made between the first draft of the
   web-based decision-aid tool and the final version during the summer of
   2019 after an expert consultation of experts (n=3), focus group
   participants (n=28), and parents in the iterative process (n=5). More
   information about HPV and vaccines was added, and users could click if
   more detail is desired. Conclusions: We developed and pilot-tested 3
   interventions using an iterative process. The interventions were
   perceived as potentially effective to increase parents' knowledge and
   positive attitudes toward HPV vaccination, and ultimately, vaccine
   acceptance. Future research will assess the effectiveness of these
   interventions on a larger scale.},

Title = {Communicating Findings of Delayed Diagnostic Evaluation to Primary Care
   Providers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN BOARD OF FAMILY MEDICINE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Pages = {469-473},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {Background: We previously found that an intervention involving
   electronic algorithms to detect delays in follow-up of cancer-related
   abnormal or ``red-flag{''} findings and communicating this information
   to primary care providers (PCPs) led to more timely diagnostic
   evaluation. In this study, we examined the effectiveness of various
   communication strategies to inform PCPs about the delayed follow-up.
   Methods: After identifying follow-up delays through electronic health
   record-based algorithms and record reviews, we communicated this
   information to PCPs using 3 escalating steps. First, we sent secure
   E-mails. If no evidence of follow-up was found in a medical record
   review after 1 week, we made up to 3 attempts to reach the PCPs or their
   nurses via telephone. If they could not be reached, we informed clinic
   directors as the third and final step. In this analysis, we evaluate
   PCPs' follow-up in response to these methods of communication.
   Results: A total of 733 patients with follow-up delays were identified
   (369 patients in the intervention group and 364 patients in the control
   group). Communicating information to PCPs about possible follow-up
   delays led to decreased times to diagnostic evaluation, but
   communication related to delays did not always lead to follow-up for the
   patients in the intervention group. Specifically, secure E-mails led to
   follow-up in 11.1\% of cases (41 of 369), telephone calls led to
   follow-up in 68.6\% of cases (225 of 328), and contacting clinic
   directors led to follow-up in 5 of 11 cases in which communication
   escalated to this level.
   Conclusion: Strategies to communicate to PCPs information on delayed
   follow-up of findings suspicious for cancer were useful, but not
   fail-safe. Additional back-up strategies, such as using case
   coordinators, might be needed.},

Abstract = {Targeted attacks on civil society and non-governmental organizations
   have gone underreported despite the fact that these organizations have
   been shown to be frequent targets of these attacks. In this paper, we
   shed light on targeted malware attacks faced by these organizations by
   studying malicious e-mails received by 10 civil society organizations
   (the majority of which are from groups related to China and Tibet
   issues) over a period of 4 years.
   Our study highlights important properties of malware threats faced by
   these organizations with implications on how these organizations defend
   themselves and how we quantify these threats. We find that the technical
   sophistication of malware we observe is fairly low, with more effort
   placed on socially engineering the e-mail content. Based on this
   observation, we develop the Targeted Threat Index (TTI), a metric which
   incorporates both social engineering and technical sophistication when
   assessing the risk of malware threats. We demonstrate that this metric
   is more effective than simple technical sophistication for identifying
   malware threats with the highest potential to successfully compromise
   victims. We also discuss how education efforts focused on changing user
   behaviour can help prevent compromise. For two of the three Tibetan
   groups in our study simple steps such as avoiding the use of email
   attachments could cut document-based malware threats delivered through
   e-mail that we observed by up to 95\%.},

Abstract = {This study profiled current clinical applications of blood flow
   restriction (BFR) training and observed side effects by surveying active
   sports medicine and performance personnel across North America. An
   online survey consisting of questions derived from a related position
   statement was distributed through professional organizations, email
   listservs, and social media. Personnel with experience applying or
   prescribing BFR training with permanent residence within the United
   States or Canada were eligible to participate. Variables captured
   included demographics (profession, practice setting), BFR equipment,
   treatment parameters, observed side effects, and personal perceptions
   regarding BFR training. An alpha level of p < 0.05 determined
   significance. A convenience sample included 72 clinicians with 67 being
   from the United States. Athletic trainers (n = 35) and physical
   therapists (n = 30) primarily participated. Chi-square test of
   independence indicated that a higher proportion of physical therapists
   (90.3\%) report receiving formal education in BFR training compared with
   athletic trainers (65.7\%) (chi(2)((1)) = 4.1, p = 0.043). Parameters
   varied between respondents for exercise prescription and occlusion
   settings. Respondents primarily followed position statement
   recommendations with individualized pressure selections for resistance
   (80.9\%) and aerobic (84.8\%) BFR modes. Side effects reported included
   delayed onset muscle soreness (66.2\%), inability to continue because of
   pain (28\%), and numbness (22.5\%). Personal perceptions between
   athletic trainers and physical therapists were compared using
   independent t-tests. Physical therapists indicated higher confidence in
   safety (difference = 0.37 +/- 0.32, p = 0.026), understanding
   recommendations (difference = 0.47 +/- 0.37, p = 0.011), and theoretical
   principles (difference = 0.80 +/- 0.53, p = 0.004). Despite variation in
   BFR parameters used, sports medicine personnel demonstrate compliance
   with position statement recommendations and report mild side effects.},

Title = {Aligning Medication Reconciliation and Secure Messaging: Qualitative
   Study of Primary Care Providers' Perspectives},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {15},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Virtual (non-face-to-face) medication reconciliation
   strategies may reduce adverse drug events (ADEs) among vulnerable
   ambulatory patients. Understanding provider perspectives on the use of
   technology for medication reconciliation can inform the design of
   patient-centered solutions to improve ambulatory medication safety.
   Objective: The aim of the study was to describe primary care providers'
   experiences of ambulatory medication reconciliation and secure messaging
   (secure email between patients and providers), and to elicit perceptions
   of a virtual medication reconciliation system using secure messaging
   (SM).
   Methods: This was a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews.
   From January 2012 to May 2012, we conducted structured observations of
   primary care clinical activities and interviewed 15 primary care
   providers within a Veterans Affairs Healthcare System in Boston,
   Massachusetts (USA). We carried out content analysis informed by the
   grounded theory.
   Results: Of the 15 participating providers, 12 were female and 11 saw 10
   or fewer patients in a typical workday. Experiences and perceptions
   elicited from providers during in-depth interviews were organized into
   12 overarching themes: 4 themes for experiences with medication
   reconciliation, 3 themes for perceptions on how to improve ambulatory
   medication reconciliation, and 5 themes for experiences with SM.
   Providers generally recognized medication reconciliation as a valuable
   component of primary care delivery and all agreed that medication
   reconciliation following hospital discharge is a key priority. Most
   providers favored delegating the responsibility for medication
   reconciliation to another member of the staff, such as a nurse or a
   pharmacist. The 4 themes related to ambulatory medication reconciliation
   were (1) the approach to complex patients, (2) the effectiveness of
   medication reconciliation in preventing ADEs, (3) challenges to
   completing medication reconciliation, and (4) medication reconciliation
   during transitions of care. Specifically, providers emphasized the
   importance of medication reconciliation at the post-hospital visit.
   Providers indicated that assistance from a caregiver (eg, a family
   member) for medication reconciliation was helpful for complex or elderly
   patients and that patients' social or cognitive factors often made
   medication reconciliation challenging. Regarding providers' use of SM,
   about half reported using SM frequently, but all felt that it improved
   their clinical workflow and nearly all providers were enthusiastic about
   a virtual medication reconciliation system, such as one using SM. All
   providers thought that such a system could reduce ADEs.
   Conclusions: Although providers recognize the importance and value of
   ambulatory medication reconciliation, various factors make it difficult
   to execute this task effectively, particularly among complex or elderly
   patients and patients with complicated social circumstances. Many
   providers favor enlisting the support of pharmacists or nurses to
   perform medication reconciliation in the outpatient setting. In general,
   providers are enthusiastic about the prospect of using secure messaging
   for medication reconciliation, particularly during transitions of care,
   and believe a system of virtual medication reconciliation could reduce
   ADEs.},

Abstract = {This article provides a primer on medical device regulations in the
   United States, Europe, and Canada. Software tools are being developed
   and shared globally to enhance the accessibility and usefulness of
   genomic databases. Interactive software tools, such as email or mobile
   alert systems providing variant classification updates, are
   opportunities to democratize access to genomic data beyond laboratories
   and clinicians. Uncertainty over the reliability of outputs, however,
   raises concerns about potential harms to patients, especially where
   software is accessible to lay users. Developers may also need to contend
   with unfamiliar medical device regulations. The application of
   regulatory controls to genomic software could improve patient and user
   safety, but could also stifle innovation. Legal uncertainty for
   developers is compounded where software applications are made available
   globally (implicating multiple regulatory frameworks), and directly to
   lay users. Moreover, there is considerable uncertainty over the
   application of (evolving) medical device regulations in the context of
   both software and genetics. In this article, criteria and examples are
   provided to inform determinations of software as medical devices, as
   well as risk classification. We conclude with strategies for using
   genomic communication and interpretation software to maximize the
   availability and usefulness of genetic information, while mitigating the
   risk of harm to users.},

Title = {Internet Use for Health-Related Information via Personal Computers and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {OCT-DEC},
Abstract = {Background: The Internet is known to be used for health purposes by the
   general public all over the world. However, little is known about the
   use of, attitudes toward, and activities regarding eHealth among the
   Japanese population.
   Objectives: This study aimed to measure the prevalence of Internet use
   for health-related information compared with other sources, and to
   examine the effects on user knowledge, attitudes, and activities with
   regard to Internet use for health-related information in Japan. We
   examined the extent of use via personal computers and cell phones.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of a quasi-representative
   sample (N = 1200) of the Japanese general population aged 15-79 years in
   September 2007. The main outcome measures were (1) self-reported rates
   of Internet use in the past year to acquire health-related information
   and to contact health professionals, family, friends, and peers
   specifically for health-related purposes, and (2) perceived effects of
   Internet use on health care.
   Results: The prevalence of Internet use via personal computer for
   acquiring health-related information was 23.8\% (286/1200) among those
   surveyed, whereas the prevalence via cell phone was 6\% (77). Internet
   use via both personal computer and cell phone for communicating with
   health professionals, family, friends, or peers was not common. The
   Internet was used via personal computer for acquiring health-related
   information primarily by younger people, people with higher education
   levels, and people with higher household incomes. The majority of those
   who used the Internet for health care purposes responded that the
   Internet improved their knowledge or affected their lifestyle attitude,
   and that they felt confident in the health-related information they
   obtained from the Internet. However, less than one-quarter thought it
   improved their ability to manage their health or affected their
   health-related activities.
   Conclusions: Japanese moderately used the Internet via personal
   computers for health purposes, and rarely used the Internet via cell
   phones. Older people, people with lower education levels, and people
   with lower household incomes were less likely to access the Internet via
   cell phone. The Internet moderately improved users' health-related
   knowledge and attitudes but seldom changed their health-related
   abilities and activities. To encourage communication between health
   providers and consumers, it is important to improve eHealth literacy,
   especially in middle-aged people. It is also important to make adequate
   amendments to the reimbursement payment system and nationwide eHealth
   privacy and security framework, and to develop a collaborative
   relationship among industry, government, and academia.},

Abstract = {Over the last 70 years there has been a major shift in the threats to
   global peace. While the 1950's and 1960's were characterised by the cold
   war and the arms race, many security threats are now characterised by
   group behaviours that are disruptive, subversive or extreme. In many
   cases such groups are loosely and chaotically organised, but their
   ideals are sociologically and psychologically embedded in group members
   to the extent that the group represents a major threat. As a result,
   insights into how human groups form, emerge and change are critical, but
   surprisingly limited insights into the mutability of human groups exist.
   In this paper we argue that important clues to understand the mutability
   of groups come from examining the evolutionary origins of human
   behaviour. In particular, groups have been instrumental in human
   evolution, used as a basis to derive survival advantage, leaving all
   humans with a basic disposition to navigate the world through social
   networking and managing their presence in a group. From this analysis we
   present five critical features of social groups that govern mutability,
   relating to social norms, individual standing, status rivalry, ingroup
   bias and cooperation. We argue that understanding how these five
   dimensions interact and evolve can provide new insights into group
   mutation and evolution. Importantly, these features lend themselves to
   digital modeling. Therefore computational simulation can support
   generative exploration of groups and the discovery of latent factors,
   relevant to both internal group and external group modelling. Finally we
   consider the role of online social media in relation to understanding
   the mutability of groups. This can play an active role in supporting
   collective behaviour, and analysis of social media in the context of the
   five dimensions of group mutability provides a fresh basis to interpret
   the forces affecting groups.},

Abstract = {This email interview with James B. Jacobs was conducted during 2014. As
   a law student at University of Chicago in the early 1970s, Jacobs
   conducted a participant observation study at Stateville Penitentiary,
   Illinois' largest and most notorious maximum security prison. That
   research resulted in his first major publication, ``Street Gangs Behind
   Bars{''} published in Social Problems (1973). In 1975, after receiving
   his J.D. and Ph.D. (Sociology), Jacobs joined Cornell University as
   assistant professor of law and sociology. In 1977, the University of
   Chicago Press published his revised doctoral dissertation, Stateville;
   The Penitentiary in Mass Society (1977). In 1982, Jacobs moved to New
   York University (NYU) as professor of law and director of the Center for
   Research in Crime and Justice. In the mid 1980s, he served as consultant
   to the New York State Organized Crime Task Force's investigation of
   corruption and racketeering in NYC's construction industry. Jacobs was
   the draftsman of OCTF's Final Report on Corruption and Racketeering in
   NYC's Construction Industry (NYU Press, 1990). He subsequently published
   four additional volumes on organized crime and organized crime control,
   most recently Breaking the Devil's Pact: The Battle to Free the
   Teamsters from the Mob (2011).},

Title = {Post-separation parenting apps in the hands of family law practitioners:
   expectations versus experience},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW POLICY AND THE FAMILY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {Post-separation parenting apps are an alternative to mainstream digital
   communication (e.g. text and email) for separated parents. They vary in
   cost and features, generally incorporating a messaging tool, shared
   calendar, expense tracker, and the ability to export records for legal
   purposes. While often recommended in the context of family law, evidence
   for efficacy and safety is lacking. This study sought insights from
   family law professionals about the value of post-separation parenting
   apps in high-conflict cases. Thirty family mediators, known in Australia
   as Family Dispute Resolution Practitioners, role-played pairs of
   high-conflict separated parents using one of 10 popular post-separation
   parenting apps. After completing a set of common co-parenting tasks,
   dyadic interviews and focus groups were used to discuss their
   observations. Overall, practitioners expressed disappointment with the
   apps. Key themes included potential individual differences in separated
   parents' technical skills, time availability, and intentions towards app
   use. Usability challenges specific to the tested apps were also
   identified. Rather than simplifying interactions for separated parents,
   these combined contextual variables were thought likely to contribute to
   frustration and inter-parental conflict. As a result, practitioners in
   the study resolved to be far more cautious with app recommendations for
   high-conflict clients.},

Title = {Towards Pattern-Based Change Verification Framework for Cloud-Enabled
   Healthcare Component-Based},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {148007-148020},
Abstract = {To survive in the competitive environment, most organizations have
   adopted component-based software development strategies in the rapid
   technology advancement era and the proper utilization of cloud-based
   services. To facilitate the continuous configuration, reduce complexity,
   and faster system delivery for higher user satisfaction in dynamic
   scenarios. In cloud services, customers select services from web
   applications dynamically. Healthcare body sensors are commonly used for
   diagnosis and monitoring patients continuously for their emergency
   treatment. The healthcare devices are connected with mobile or laptop
   etc. on cloud environment with network and frequently change
   applications. Thus, organizations rely on regression testing during
   changes and implementation to validate the quality and reliability of
   the system after the alteration. However, for a large application with
   limited resources and frequently change component management activities
   in the cloud computing environment, component-based system verification
   is difficult and challenging due to irrelevant and redundant test cases
   and faults. In this study, proposed a test case selection and
   prioritization framework using a design pattern to increase the faults
   detection rate. First, we select test cases on frequently accessed
   components using observer patterns and, secondly, prioritize test cases
   on adopting some strategies. The proposed framework was validated by an
   experiment and compared with other techniques (previous faults based and
   random priority). Hence, experimental results show that the proposed
   framework successfully verified changes. Subsequently, the proposed
   framework increases the fault detection rate (i.e., more than 90\%) than
   previous faults based and random priority (i.e., more than 80\%
   respectively).},

Abstract = {Purpose: To investigate physicians' and nurses' attitudes and actions
   related to the prescription and administration of perioperative
   antibiotics and opioids during a 2-week period.
   Design: A quantitative descriptive and analytical research design
   performed at a Danish University Hospital.
   Methods:An email survey using an 18-item questionnaire was sent to 163
   nurses and physicians involved in the perioperative period.
   Findings: Of 163 participants, 114 (69.9\%) returned the questionnaire.
   Between 12\% and 29\% of the respondents reported that they did not
   correctly manage the medication, although they thought it to be
   important. Between 41\% and 68\% of the respondents experienced
   incorrect medication management with significant differences among
   professions and specialties.
   Conclusions: The study confirms a knowing doing gap in medication
   management in perioperative settings, highlighting the need to address
   this issue, to ensure that physicians and nurses act in accordance with
   their beliefs and consider the importance of medication safety in
   interdisciplinary work across specialties.},

Abstract = {The e-mail is therefore one of the most used methods for its efficiency
   and profitability. In the last few years, the undesirables emails (SPAM)
   are widely spread as they play an important part in the inbox.
   Consequently, several recent studies have provided evidence of the
   importance of detection and filtering of SPAM as a major interest for
   the Internet community. In the present paper, the authors propose and
   experiment a new and original meta-heuristic based on the renal system
   for detection and filtering spam. The natural model of the renal system
   is taken as an inspiration for its purification of blood, the filtering
   of toxins as well as the regularization of the blood pressure. The
   messages are represented by both a bag words and N-Gram method which is
   independent of languages because an email can be received in any
   language. After that, the authors propose to use two models to apply a
   Bayesien classification on textual data: Bernoulli or Multinomial model.},

   laissez-faire absent coercion. Whereas current
   policies-decriminalization, criminalization of the buy or sell sides,
   and licensing-are ineffective against trafficking or harm voluntary
   suppliers, we show that an alternative policy can restore the benchmark
   outcome. Our results are relevant to the ongoing debate about
   decriminalizing prostitution and provide guidance for empirical work on

Abstract = {Background: We have co-designed a tailored blended physiotherapy
   intervention for people with progressive multiple sclerosis (PwPMS) who
   often struggle to access support for physical activity. Underpinned by
   self-management principles, the Lifestyle, Exercise and Activity Package
   for people with Multiple Sclerosis (LEAP-MS) intervention incorporates
   face-to-face or online physiotherapy coaching sessions with an
   accompanying online physical activity platform. The LEAP-MS platform is
   a multi-user system enabling user and physiotherapist to co-create
   activity plans. The LEAP-MS platform consists of an information and
   activity suite, interactive components enabling selection of exercises
   into an activity programme, goal setting and activity logging. The
   platform also facilitates online remote support from a physiotherapist
   through an embedded online messaging function. We aim to evaluate the
   LEAP-MS platform in a feasibility trial.
   Methods: LEAP-MS will be evaluated within a single-arm feasibility study
   with embedded process evaluation. After registration and initial
   eligible screening, 21 participants will be required to complete
   baseline self-completion measures. This will be followed by an initial
   home-based or online coaching session with a physiotherapist (who has
   received tailored self-management and digital resource training) and
   access to the online intervention for an initial 3-month period. During
   this period, participants are given the option to request up to five
   further home-based or online physiotherapy coaching sessions. Follow-up
   questionnaires and semi-structured interviews will be administered 3
   months after baseline with participants and intervention
   physiotherapists. The LEAP-MS platform will be available to participants
   for a further 3 months. Usage of the LEAP-MS platform will be tracked
   during the full 6-month period and final follow-up will be conducted 6
   months after baseline.
   Discussion: Feasibility outcomes (recruitment, retention, intervention
   uptake and safety) will be reported. The process evaluation will be
   undertaken to identify possible mechanisms for any observed effects. The
   data will inform full-scale evaluations of this co-produced, blended
   physiotherapy intervention.},

Abstract = {Mobile devices usually provide a ``factory-reset{''} tool to erase
   user-specific data from the main secondary storage. 9 Apple iPhones, 10
   Android devices, and 2 BlackBerry devices were tested in the first
   systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of factory resets. Tests used
   the Cellebrite UME-36 Pro with the UFED Physical Analyzer, the Bulk
   Extractor open-source tool, and our own programs for extracting
   metadata, classifying file paths, and comparing them between images. Two
   phones were subjected to more detailed analysis. Results showed that
   many kinds of data were removed by the resets, but much user-specific
   configuration data was left. Android devices did poorly at removing user
   documents and media, and occasional surprising user data was left on all
   devices including photo images, audio, documents, phone numbers, email
   addresses, geolocation data, configuration data, and keys. A conclusion
   is that reset devices can still provide some useful information to a
   forensic investigation.},

Abstract = {Authentication means preserving the systems and information from
   unwanted unauthorized access, usage, disclosure, disruption,
   integration, inspection, modification or destruction of the information.
   The studies have shown that the text passwords are more vulnerable to
   shoulder surfing, brute force, and dictionary attacks. The password with
   images are hard to guess and will provide a more secure way to access
   the recourse, with much more security but they are still vulnerable to
   shoulder surfing attacks.
   In proposed system the video is used as a password. OpenCv (open source
   computer vision) is used, which is an open source to capture video and
   will extract the frames out of the videos and these frames are stored in
   an encrypted form using AES(advanced encryption standard) and in turn to
   authenticate the user JAMA(numerical linear algebra library) is used.
   Java is used for implementation which is platform independent. The
   proposed method can be used where the password protection is required
   like in banking, educational systems, social accounts, Gmail, email,
   desktops and in every field where the information is required to be
   protected.},

Abstract = {The internet has brought a world of additional opportunities in terms of
   new business models and communications. In recent years the growth of
   electronic communication has almost become taken for granted, and
   nowhere has this been more evident than in the area of real-time
   communications. The use of Instant Messaging (IM) has grown by leaps and
   bounds over this period and has established a firm presence in many
   corporations. Despite this, IM has a mixed identity, perhaps masked to
   some extent by email which, for the time being at least, is a more
   established and better understood channel. This rapid growth of IM has
   presented many European organisations with a challenge in terms of
   identifying the nature of this channel and how it should be addressed;
   is IM an insidious application designed to bypass existing and expensive
   perimeter security solutions or is it a business enabler, allowing a
   range of corporate functions to benefit from access to real-time
   communication. Many organizations are now offering an additional
   component in their messaging infrastructures designed to allow the safe
   and secure integration of
   IM into the realm of acceptable corporate communication channels.
   Providing a full range of messaging management functions, from
   anti-virus and content scanning through to reviewing and archiving, such
   instant messaging management components mitigate the many any potential
   risk coming from the this channel. In addition an effective security
   infrastructure also safely permits the enhancement of existing
   applications through extending this real-time communication platform
   into standard back and front office applications. This paper shows how
   the proliferation of real-time communications has brought with it a
   series of real-time threats and shows how the implementation of an
   effective management infrastructure can offset the risks arising, while
   at the same time providing the basis for the next generation of
   electronic communication, where a user's presence becomes layered into
   potentially any application.},

   This paper's purpose is highlighting the functionality of our smart city
   mobile application, it's features and the way it can influence our lives
   and the way we interact with the world around us in everyday activities.
   The system we are describing can monitor and give the end user viewing
   access to important information about the city he / she lives in. It can
   also send alerts in the form of push notifications, SMS messages or
   email about public interest information, new laws, shops, emergencies,
   natural disasters or any relevant information for the public. Using this
   application, the public can also send useful feedback to the authorities
   about broken stuff existing in the city, potholes, accidents, etc.,
   while also using the mobile devices geolocation feature to indicate the
   specified location's problem
   The application can also be used to view information about the users,
   home, as electric consumption, temperature in different rooms, water
   quality, outside weather, security camera feed, security alarm state,
   etc. The users can also interact with the application and send commands
   to his / her smart home, like starting or stopping the central heating,
   starting or stopping different home appliances.},

Abstract = {Spam messes up user's inbox, consumes network resources and spread worms
   and viruses. Spam is flooding of unsolicited,unwanted e mail. Spam in
   blogs is called blog spam or comment spam. It is done by posting
   comments or flooding spams to the services such as blogs,
   forums,news,email archives and guestbooks. Blog spams generally appears
   on guestbooks or comment pages where spammers fill a comment box with
   spam words. In addition to wasting user's time with unwanted comments,
   spam also consumes a lot of bandwith. In this paper, we propose a
   software. tool to prevent such blog spams by using Bayesian Algorithm
   based technique. It is derived from Bayes' Theorem. It gives an output
   which has a probability that any comment is spam, given that it has
   certain words in it. With using our past entries and a comment entry,
   this value is obtained and compared with a threshold value to find if it
   exceeds the threshold value or not. By using this cocept, we developed a
   software tool to block comment spam. The experimetal results shows that
   the bayesian based tool is working well. This paper has the major
   findings and their significance of blog spam filter.},

Abstract = {Web applications have experienced a widespread adaptation owing to the
   agile Service Oriented Ar-chitecture (SOA) reflecting the ever-changing
   software needs of users. Google Meet is one of the top video
   conferencing applications, especially in the post-COVID19 era. Security
   and privacy concerns are therefore critical. This paper presents an
   extensive digital forensic analysis of Google Meet running on multiple
   browsers and software platforms including Google Chrome, Mozilla
   Firefox, and Microsoft Edge browsers in Windows 10 and Linux. Artifacts,
   traces of potential evidence, are extracted from different locations on
   a client's desktop, including the memory and browser. These include
   meeting records, communication records, email addresses, profile
   pictures, history, downloads, bookmarks, cache, cookies, etc. We explore
   how different Random Access Memory (RAM) sizes of client devices impact
   the persistence and format of extracted memory artifacts. A memory
   artifact extraction tool is developed to automate the extraction of
   artifacts identified via unstructured string analysis. Google Meet
   forensic artifacts are critical in that they are potential digital
   evidence in relevant criminal investigations. Additionally, they
   highlight that user data can be extracted despite implementing multiple
   privacy and security mechanisms.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by

Abstract = {Objective: The objective of this study is to determine the major
   stressors affecting practicing breast radiologists.
   Methods: All members of the Society of Breast Imaging within the United
   States received an email invitation to complete an anonymous survey
   evaluating stressors that may contribute to physician burnout. Stressors
   evaluated included pace at work, work-life balance, care of dependents,
   job security, financial strain, decreasing reimbursement, new
   regulations, delivering bad news, fear of getting sued, and dealing with
   difficult patients, radiologists, and administrators.
   Results: The overall response rate was 13.5\% (312/2308). For those who
   opened the email, response rate was 24.6\% (312/1269). The most
   prevalent stressors reported were working too fast (222/312, 71.2\%),
   balancing demands of work with personal life (209/312, 70.0\%), fear of
   getting sued (164/312, 52.6\%), and dealing with difficult
   administrators (156/312, 50\%). Prevalence of stress related to new
   regulation requirements, job security, financial strain, decreased
   reimbursement, dependent care, call, delivering bad news, and dealing
   with difficult patients, difficult referrers, and difficult radiologists
   were present in fewer than 50\% of respondents.
   Conclusion: The most prevalent sources of stress in breast imaging
   radiologists relate to working too fast and balancing demands of work
   with time needed for personal life.},

Title = {International survey of seat belt use exemptions},
Journal = {INJURY PREVENTION},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Pages = {258-261},

Abstract = {Background: Substantial evidence of seatbelt efficacy has been shown by
   several studies, and it is widely recommended that motor vehicle
   occupants use properly fitted seat belts. However, some ( but a
   heretofore unknown number of) countries with national seat belt laws
   permit various exemptions which may lower use rates. The aim of this
   study was to survey the variety of exemptions to national seat belt
   laws.
   Methods: This investigation relied on identifying respondents from
   national traffic safety agencies, other governmental and
   non-governmental organizations, Internet searches, personal contacts,
   and other sources. Questionnaires were deployed through a web based
   survey supplemented by email and postal versions.
   Results: Responses were received from 30 countries of which 28 (93.7\%)
   had a national seat belt law. About two thirds (63.7\%) of the 28
   national laws applied to both front and back seat passengers. The
   leading exemption types included vehicles made before a certain year (n
   = 13), antique vehicles (n = 12), military vehicles (n = 11), buses (n =
   9), and emergency vehicles (n = 8). Most responding countries reported
   one or more specific categories of individuals as exempt including those
   with medical exemptions (n = 20), taxi drivers (n = 11), police (n = 9),
   emergency medical personnel (n = 8), physically disabled people (n = 6),
   and pregnant women (n = 6). Out of 26 responses to the question
   regarding current level of enforcement, 42.3\% felt enforcement was
   ``very good or good'' and 57.7\% characterized it as ``fair or poor''.
   Conclusions: This study represents one of the largest international
   traffic law surveys reported. Most national seatbelt laws offer perilous
   exemptions to a broad array of vehicle types and road user groups. These
   findings, coupled with concern over the level of enforcement in the
   majority of countries surveyed, suggest that international road safety
   efforts have a long way to go to improve coverage and enforcement of
   national seat belt laws.},

Abstract = {For each authority which maintains more than one information system, a
   uniform user authorization is an issue. Latvian University of
   Agriculture (LLU) use at least four information systems, which would
   need to introduce a uniform user authorization. They are: the website,
   email system, LLUIS, library. These systems use a large proportion of
   university staff and students, but they are not the only systems. Some
   departments use information systems of different size such as
   accounting, economic authority, hostels. All LLU information systems
   have a separate user management - hence the authorization. Such a
   situation has arisen because the information systems were designed for a
   different range of users and at different times. Historically, the
   uniform user management was not necessary for those information systems.
   As time moves on, the information systems was expanded to offer the user
   experience to a wider range of users. Consequently, a uniform user
   authorization issue arises. Now it is a situation that one and the same
   person is a registered user in LLUIS, e-mail system and the university
   website. The user must remember multiple login names and possibly also
   different passwords. This is inconvenient for the user, but there are
   also a number of security problems. If an employee is dismissed from
   employment, his account needs to be blocked in all systems in which he
   has ever been registered. Because each information system has its own
   administrator, often the user's access is blocked in some information
   systems, if anything is blocked.
   Uniform user management would allow for centralized management to add,
   delete and define user privileges. Unified user management would allow
   to immediately determine which information systems the person uses.
   Unified user authorization is obvious, but it wouldn't be easy to
   implement. Firstly a large proportion of university information systems
   is a special order, which was build up based on university requirements.
   Such systems generally have not been provided for external user
   management. Information systems are developed by different suppliers in
   different programming languages (php, c++, c\#), so that external user
   management option would have to develop for each system separately. The
   author shall specify the largest LLU information system authorization
   mechanisms and analyze how difficult it would be to convert it to work
   with an external user management. The author gives proposals for a
   single user management choices, or design, depending on the university's
   future vision for their own information systems.},

Abstract = {Up to two-thirds of older Canadian adults have high nutrition risk,
   which predisposes them to frailty, hospitalization and death. The aim of
   this study was to examine the effect of a brief education intervention
   on nutrition risk and use of adaptive strategies to promote dietary
   resilience among community-dwelling older adults living in Alberta,
   Canada, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study design was a single-arm
   intervention trial with pre-post evaluation. Participants (N = 28, age
   65+ years) in the study completed a survey online or via telephone.
   Questions included the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), SCREEN-14, a brief
   poverty screen, and a World Health Organization-guided questionnaire
   regarding awareness and use of nutrition-related services and resources
   (S and R). A brief educational intervention involved raising participant
   awareness of available nutrition S and R. Education was offered via
   email or postal mail with follow-up surveys administered 3 months later.
   Baseline and follow-up nutrition risk scores, S and R awareness and use
   were compared using paired t-test. Three-quarters of participants had a
   high nutrition risk, but very few reported experiencing financial strain
   or food insecurity. Those at high nutrition risk were more likely to
   report eating alone, compared to those who scored as low risk. There was
   a significant increase in awareness of 20 S and R as a result of the
   educational intervention, but no change in use. The study shows
   increasing individual knowledge about services and resources in the
   community is not sufficient to change use of these services or improve
   nutrition risk.},

Abstract = {Although the intrusion detection system industry is rapidly maturing,
   the state of intrusion detection system evaluation is not. The off-line
   dataset evaluation proposed by MIT Lincoln Lab is a practical solution
   in terms of evaluating the performance of IDS. While the evaluation
   dataset represents a significant and monumental undertaking, there
   remain several issues unsolved in the design and modeling of the
   resulting dataset which may make the evaluation results biased. Some
   researchers have noticed such problems and criticized the design and
   execution of the dataset, but there is no technical contribution for new
   efforts proposed per se. In this paper we present our efforts to
   redesign and generate new dataset. We first study how network
   applications and user behaviors characterize the network traffic.
   Second, we apply ourselves to improve on the background traffic
   simulation (including HTTP, SMTP, POP, P2P, FTP and other types of
   traffic). Unlike the existing model, our model simulates traffic from
   user level rather than from packet level, which is more reasonable for
   background traffic modeling and simulation. Our model takes advantage of
   user-level web mining, automatic user profiling and Enron email dataset
   etc. The high fidelity of simulated background traffic is shown in
   experiment. Moreover, different kinds of attacker personalities are
   profiled and more than 300 instances of 62 different automated attacks
   are launched against victim hosts and servers. All our efforts try to
   make the dataset more ``real{''} and therefore be fairer for IDS
   evaluation.},

Abstract = {We sought to describe risk factors for latex glove allergy symptoms
   among health care workers by combining data from an active clinical
   surveillance program and a comprehensive occupational health
   surveillance system. A total of 4,584 employers completed a latex
   allergy questionnaire. Six. percent (n = 276) of subjects reported
   symptoms consistent with latex allergy. Years of latex glove use was a
   significant risk factor for latex allergy symptoms even after
   controlling for the effects of atopy, gender, age, race, fruit, and
   other allergies. Nurses, medical or lab technicians, physician's
   assistants, other clinical professionals, and housekeepers had the
   highest prevalence of latex glove allergy symptoms. Forty subjects
   (0.87\%) who were confirmed as having latex sensitization.
   Sensitizsation may have been underestimated due to use of specific IgE
   antibody, less sensitive than skin-prick testing, and tiered design
   leading to laboratory assessment on a subset of the cohort. This
   surveillance program identified risk factors for latex allergy symptoms.
   Our findings provide a basis for tailoring future prevention strategies.},

Abstract = {With the rapid growth of data sources, Big data security in Cloud is a
   big challenge. Different issues have ascended in the area of Big data
   security such as infrastructure security, data privacy, data management
   and data integrity. Currently, Big data processing, analytics and
   storage is secured using cryptography algorithms, which are not
   appropriate for Big data protection over Cloud. In this paper, we
   present a solution for addressing the main issues in Big data security
   over Cloud. We propose a novel system architecture called the Secure
   Authentication and Data Sharing in Cloud (SADS-Cloud). There are three
   processes involved in this paper including (i). Big Data Outsourcing,
   (ii). Big Data Sharing and (iii). Big Data Management. In Big data
   outsourcing, the data owners are registered to a Trust Center using
   SHA-3 hashing algorithm. The MapReduce model is used to split the input
   file into fixed-size of blocks of data and SALSA20 encryption algorithm
   is applied over each block. In Big data sharing, data users participate
   in a secure file retrieval. For this purpose, user's credentials (ID,
   password, secure ID, and current times-tamp, email id) are hashed and
   compared with that stored in a database. In Big data management, there
   are three important processes implemented to organize data. They are as
   follows: Compression using Lemperl Ziv Markow Algorithm (LZMA),
   Clustering using Density-based Clustering of Applications with Noise
   (DBSCAN), and Indexing using Fractal Index Tree. The proposed scheme for
   these processes are implemented using Java Programming and performance
   tested for the following metrics: Information Loss, Compression Ratio,
   Throughput, Encryption Time and Decryption Time. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Abstract = {Cloud apps like Google Docs and Trello are popular because they enable
   real-time collaboration with colleagues, and they make it easy for us to
   access our work from all of our devices. However, by centralizing data
   storage on servers, cloud apps also take away ownership and agency from
   users. If a service shuts down, the software stops functioning, and data
   created with that software is lost.
   In this article we propose local-first software, a set of principles for
   software that enables both collaboration and ownership for users.
   Local-first ideals include the ability to work offline and collaborate
   across multiple devices, while also improving the security, privacy,
   long-term preservation, and user control of data.
   We survey existing approaches to data storage and sharing, ranging from
   email attachments to web apps to Firebase-backed mobile apps, and we
   examine the trade-offs of each. We look at Conflict-free Replicated Data
   Types (CRDTs): data structures that are multi-user from the ground up
   while also being fundamentally local and private. CRDTs have the
   potential to be a foundational technology for realizing local-first
   software.
   We share some of our findings from developing local-first software
   prototypes at the Ink \& Switch research lab over the course of several
   years. These experiments test the viability of CRDTs in practice, and
   explore the user interface challenges for this new data model. Lastly,
   we suggest some next steps for moving towards local-first software: for
   researchers, for app developers, and a startup opportunity for
   entrepreneurs.},

Title = {COVID-19 related negative emotions and emotional suppression are
   associated with greater risk perceptions among emergency nurses: A
   cross-sectional study},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES ADVANCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: As the COVID-19 pandemic began, frontline nurses experienced
   many emotions as they faced risks relevant to both patients (e.g.,
   making errors resulting in patient harm) and themselves (e.g., becoming
   infected with COVID-19). Although emotions are often neglected in the
   patient safety literature, research in affective science suggests that
   emotions may significantly impact nurses' perceptions of risk, which can
   have downstream consequences. Further, the use of chronic emotion
   regulation strategies that are known to differ in adaptability and
   effectiveness (i. e., emotional suppression, reappraisal) can impact
   risk perceptions. Objective: To investigate the relationship between
   nurses' emotional experiences in response to the pandemic and their
   estimates of how likely they would be to experience adverse outcomes
   related to both patients and themselves within the next six months.
   Additionally, we investigated the extent to which the use of suppression
   and reappraisal processes to manage emotions are associated with these
   risk perceptions. Design: Cross-sectional survey.Setting: Online survey
   distributed via email to emergency nurses at eight hospitals in the
   north-eastern United States during fall 2020. Participants: 132
   emergency nurses (Mage = 37.05; 81.1\% Female; 89.4\% White). Methods:
   Nurses reported the extent to which they experienced a variety of
   positive (e.g., hope, optimism) and negative (e.g., fear, sadness)
   emotions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and reported their
   perceptions of risk to both patients and themselves. Nurses also
   completed the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, a measure of chronic
   tendencies to engage in emotional suppression and reappraisal.
   Immediately prior to providing data for this study, nurses completed an
   unrelated decision-making study.Results: Nurses' negative emotions in
   response to COVID-19 were associated with greater per-ceptions of both
   patient safety risks (b = 0.31, p < .001) and personal risks (b = 0.34,
   p < .001). The relationships between positive emotions and risk
   perceptions were not statistically significant (all p values > 0.66).
   Greater chronic tendencies to suppress emotions uniquely predicted
   greater perceptions of patient safety risks (b = 2.91, p = .036) and
   personal risks (b = 2.87, p = .040) among nurses; however, no
   statistically significant relationships with reappraisal emerged (all p
   values > 0.16).Conclusions: Understanding factors that influence
   perceptions of risk are important, given that these perceptions can
   motivate behaviours that may adversely impact patient safety. Such an
   understanding is essential to inform the development of interventions to
   mitigate threats to pa-tient safety that emerge from nurses' negative
   emotional experiences and their use of different emotion regulation
   strategies. Tweetable abstract: Covid-related negative emotions and
   emotional suppression are associated with greater patient and personal
   risk perceptions among emergency nurses @lindamisbell @Nathan\_Huff\_1},

Abstract = {Introduction Primary retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a common hereditary
   retinal disease in ophthalmology that has a considerable impact on
   quality of life, but there are few effective therapeutic strategies.
   This trial aims to determine the efficacy and safety of acupuncture
   versus sham acupuncture (SA) for RP. Methods and analysis This is a
   study protocol for a randomised, participant-blind, sham-controlled
   trial. 64 eligible patients with RP will randomly be divided into
   acupuncture group and SA group. All groups will receive 48 sessions over
   3 months. Participants will complete the trial by visiting the research
   centre in month 6/9 for a follow-up assessment. The primary outcome is
   visual field mean sensitivity and visual field mean deviation at month
   3/6/9 compared with baseline. Secondary outcomes include the
   best-corrected visual acuity, central macular thickness, subfoveal
   choroidal thicknes, traditional Chinese medicine syndrome score and the
   scale of life quality for diseases with visual impairment at month 3/6/9
   compared with baseline. Adverse events and safety indexes will be
   recorded throughout the study. SPSS V.25.0 statistical software was used
   for analysis, and measurement data were expressed as mean +/- SD. Ethics
   and dissemination Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee
   of the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (approval no: ChiECRCT20200460).
   The results of this study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal,
   and trial participants will be informed via email and/or phone calls.},

Title = {Technological aspects and recommendations for applying teledentistry in
   oral medicine: a scoping review},
Journal = {SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 5},
Abstract = {BackgroundTeledentistry is applied in oral medicine to help dental
   practitioners and specialists manage complex oral conditions. This
   scoping review aims to synthesize the available evidence regarding the
   technical requirements and the provision of security services, as well
   as the recommendations on standard oral cavity photography methods for
   using teledentistry in oral medicine.MethodThe present scoping review
   was conducted in 2022 according to the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI)
   manual. Four databases were systematically searched, including ISI Web
   of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and ProQuest, from January 1999 to December
   2021. After finalizing the search strategy, all the original articles,
   reviews, editorials, letters, comments, and book chapters were included.
   All the dissertations uploaded in English with a full-text electronic
   file were also included to achieve a comprehensive picture of the
   available literature. Two types of analysis were applied: the
   quantitative descriptive analysis applying Excel 2016 and the
   qualitative thematic analysis using MAXQDA version 10.ResultsThe
   included papers were published during 1999-2021. Most of the included
   articles were from Brazil (n = 9, 21.43\%), India (n = 6, 14.28\%), the
   USA (n = 6, 14.28\%), and the UK (n = 5, 11.90\%). Social media usage as
   a teledentistry platform increased considerably between 2019 and 2021.
   Teledentistry platforms have been classified into four categories,
   including email, telephone, social network applications (WhatsApp, zoom,
   Google Meeting, Instagram, line Application, Viber, and Messenger), and
   teledentistry systems (teledentistry systems, which were designed
   specially to perform a teledentistry project). Teledentistry has been
   conducted to store and forward (n = 15, 30.71\%), real-time (n = 9,
   21.43\%), or both (n = 12, 35.71\%). According to the thematic results,
   basic technical requirements have been categorized into four, including
   teledentistry platform, type of interactions, internet connection, and
   photography tool. Other thematic results demonstrate seven categories of
   recommendations, including general factors, light, patient position,
   phone position, setting of a mobile phone camera, photo sending
   requirements, and photo visualization.ConclusionAccording to the
   results, over the past 7 years, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic,
   social network applications such as WhatsApp and Zoom have been used
   more frequently. Also, photography recommendations with a mobile phone
   camera depend on several factors such as general factors, light, patient
   position, phone position, setting of the mobile phone camera, and
   photo-sending requirements. Given the increased use of mobile cameras
   for oral photography, these recommendations can help improve the quality
   of images and subsequently improve the reliability of clinical
   decision-making in managing patients' conditions.},

Abstract = {When using non-custodial cryptocurrency wallets such as Exodus
   (Bitcoin), Metamask (Ethereum), and Keplr (Osmosis), the private keys
   are directly stored on the user's device. Using such a wallet comes with
   the risk of losing all crypto assets when the device gets lost, stolen,
   or breaks down irremediably. Fortunately, most non-custodial wallets
   offer a way to recover the private keys by the mean of a ``recovery
   phrase{''} also known as a ``mnemonic seed phrase{''}. That phrase is
   usually between 12 and 24 words and it is generated when the user
   creates the wallet. Indeed, this mnemonic phrase is a really sensitive
   piece of information since anyone knowing that phrase can get full
   control of the crypto assets held by the wallet. Usually, it is
   recommended to write this passphrase down on a piece of paper and store
   it in a ``safe place{''}. However, storing a physical object is still
   not ideal since it can get stolen, lost, or destroyed as well. In this
   paper, we propose a decentralized application that can be used to back
   up mnemonic phrases and recover them eventually using a simple email.
   This application is built on a privacy-preserving blockchain to store
   the confidential passphrase and protect the identity of its owner and
   the crypto assets holders.},

Title = {Diet or additional supplement to increase potassium intake: protocol for
   an adaptive clinical trial},
Journal = {TRIALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 14},
Abstract = {Background: High blood pressure is the leading cause of cardiovascular
   disease worldwide. The prevalence of high blood pressure is steadily
   rising as the population grows amongst older adults with the ageing
   population. Therapeutical treatments are widely available to decrease
   blood pressures, in addition to many lifestyle options, such as dietary
   changes and exercise. There is a marked preference amongst patients, as
   reiterated by Hypertension Canada, for more research into
   non-therapeutic methods for controlling blood pressure or to reduce the
   burden of taking many pills to control high blood pressure. Indeed,
   effective options do exist, especially with diet, specifically
   decreasing sodium and increasing potassium intake. Current public health
   outreach primarily focusses on sodium intake, even though potassium
   intake remains low in the Western world. Excellent data exist in
   published research that increasing potassium intake, either via dietary
   modification or supplements, reduces blood pressure and reduces risk of
   cardiovascular outcomes such as stroke. However, the advice most often
   provided by medical professionals is to `eat more fruits and vegetables'
   which has little impact on patient outcomes.
   Methods: We propose to do a clinical trial in two stages with an
   adaptive trial design. In the first stage, participants with high blood
   pressure and proven low potassium intake (measured on the basis of a
   24-h urine collection) will get individually tailored dietary advice,
   reinforced by weekly supportive phone/email support. At 4 weeks, if
   there has not been a measured increase in potassium intake, participants
   will be prescribed an additional potassium supplement. Testing will be
   conducted again at 8 weeks, to confirm the efficacy of the potassium
   supplement. Final measurements will be planned at 52 weeks to observe
   and measure the persistence of the effect of diet or additional
   supplement. Concurrent measurements of sodium intake, blood pressure,
   participant satisfaction, and safety measures will also be done.
   Discussion: The results of the study will help determine the most
   effective method of increasing potassium intake, thus reducing blood
   pressure and need for blood pressure-lowering medicines, and at the same
   time potentially increasing participant satisfaction. The current
   guidelines recommend changes in diet, not a potassium supplement, to
   increase potassium intake; hence, the two-stage design will only add
   supplements if the most rigorous dietary advice does not work.},

Title = {Integrating general practitioners' and patients' perspectives in the
   development of a digital tool supporting primary care for older patients
   with multimorbidity: a focus group study},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {7},
Month = {JAN 21},
Abstract = {Introduction The web application gp-multitool.de is based on the German
   clinical practice guideline ``multimorbidity{''} and supports mutual
   prioritisation of treatments by GPs (general practitioners) and
   patients. The application facilitates sending hyperlinks to standardized
   assessments by email, which can be completed by patients on any suitable
   digital device. GPs can document clinical decisions. The tool also
   supports a structured medication review. Aims of this study were to
   consider needs and wants of the target groups in implementing the
   ``multimorbidity{''} clinical practice guideline in a digital tool, and
   to examine themes of discussions in order to identify which aspects were
   considered most important for customising a digital tool.Materials and
   methods We conducted six focus groups with 32 GPs and six focus groups
   with 33 patients. Eight groups were conducted alongside the programming
   of the web application and four after finishing a prototype. GPs were
   recruited by mail and asked to invite up to six eligible patients from
   their practice to participate. Focus groups were based on
   semi-structured interview guides and discussed assessments,
   functionalities, usability and reliability of gp-multitool.de.
   Discussions were transcribed verbatim and analysed using content
   analysis.Results GPs wanted to avoid unnecessary and time-consuming
   functions and did not want to explore problems that they could not
   provide solutions for. For some assessments, GPs suggested simplifying
   scales or including residual categories. GPs and patients also addressed
   possible misunderstandings due to wording and discussed if some items
   might be too intimate or overtax patients intellectually. In most cases,
   participants confirmed usability, but they suggested changes in default
   settings and pointed out a few minor bugs that needed to be fixed. While
   some GPs considered data security an important topic, most patients were
   unconcerned with this issue and open to share their data.Conclusion Our
   study indicates that focus groups can be used to customize a digital
   tool according to the needs and wants of target groups and thus, improve
   content, functionality, usability, and reliability of digital tools.
   However, digital tools still need to be piloted and evaluated in
   everyday care. In our focus groups, study participants confirmed that
   gp-multitool.de can be a relevant approach for overcoming deficits in
   the information needed for mutual prioritisation of treatments by GPs
   and patients.},

Title = {Automated Essay Scoring and Revising Based on Open-Source Large Language
   Models},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {17},
Pages = {1920-1930},
Abstract = {Manually scoring and revising student essays has long been a
   time-consuming task for educators. With the rise of natural language
   processing techniques, automated essay scoring (AES) and automated essay
   revising (AER) have emerged to alleviate this burden. However, current
   AES and AER models require large amounts of training data and lack
   generalizability, which makes them hard to implement in daily teaching
   activities. Moreover, online sites offering AES and AER services charge
   high fees and have security issues uploading student content. In light
   of these challenges and recognizing the advancements in large language
   models (LLMs), we aim to fill these research gaps by analyzing the
   performance of open-source LLMs when accomplishing AES and AER tasks.
   Using a human-scored essay dataset (n = 600) collected in an online
   assessment, we implemented zero-shot, few-shot, and p-tuning AES methods
   based on the LLMs and conducted a human-machine consistency check. We
   conducted a similarity test and a score difference test for the results
   of AER with LLMs support. The human-machine consistency check result
   shows that the performance of open-source LLMs with a 10 B parameter
   size in the AES task is close to that of some deep-learning baseline
   models, and it can be improved by integrating the comment with the score
   into the shot or training continuous prompts. The similarity test and
   score difference test results show that open-source LLMs can effectively
   accomplish the AER task, improving the quality of the essays while
   ensuring that the revision results are similar to the original essays.
   This study reveals a practical path to cost-effectively,
   time-efficiently, and content-safely assisting teachers with student
   essay scoring and revising using open-source LLMs.},

Abstract = {Internet is growing with a great speed and this new human phenomenon is
   attracting the attention of all kind of people and organizations
   attractions with positive or negative purposes. Spywares, with different
   purposes are collecting people's personal information without making
   them aware of it and having their permission to do it. Such software
   often install themselves on PC's and start to collect information
   including list of websites visited by users and are able to monitor and
   detect information typed via keyboard, email addresses and other
   sensitive or secret information that user dose not intend to propagate
   or more secret information like ID's and passwords. Afterward, they send
   this information to their main spy data base. Spywares are causing
   security and political risks and problems for organizations. In this
   article we present the specification and architecture of the Hunter, an
   anti spyware, which we developed to make the systems safe against such
   intruer spywares. Implementation of such software will be described in
   two separate phases. First phase is data acquisition. We obtain a huge
   Database of whole system's process information. This is done by
   considering characteristics and operations performed by different kind
   of spywares. Whole process's information is kept in a database so that
   we can reach the best possible trust gauge by observing all aspect of
   the subject. The second phase is spy ware detection that is done by use
   of the data base which we developed in the previous phase. The spyware
   detection is done with three degree of accuracy: High, Medium and Low.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {Background Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) engage patients in
   co-evaluation of their health and wellbeing outcomes. This study aimed
   to determine the feasibility, response rate, degree of recovery and
   patient acceptability of a PROM survey for elective surgery. Methods We
   sampled patients with a broad range of elective surgeries from four
   major Australian hospitals to evaluate (1) feasibility of the technology
   used to implement the PROMs across geographically dispersed sites, (2)
   response rates for automated short message service (SMS) versus email
   survey delivery formats, (3) the degree of recovery at one and four
   weeks post-surgery as measured by the Quality of Recovery 15 Item PROM
   (QoR-15), and (4) patient acceptability of PROMS based on survey and
   focus group results. Feasibility and acceptability recommendations were
   then co-designed with stakeholders, based on the data. Results Over
   three months there were 5985 surveys responses from 20,052 surveys (30\%
   response rate). Feasibility testing revealed minor and infrequent
   technical difficulties in automated email and SMS administration of
   PROMs prior to surgery. The response rate for the QoR-15 was 34.8\% (n =
   3108/8919) for SMS and 25.8\% (n = 2877/11,133) for email. Mean QoR-15
   scores were 122.1 (SD 25.2; n = 1021); 113.1 (SD 27.7; n = 1906) and
   123.4 (SD 26.84; n = 1051) for pre-surgery and one and four weeks
   post-surgery, respectively. One week after surgery, 825 of the 1906
   responses (43\%) exceeded 122.6 (pre-surgery average), and at four weeks
   post-surgery, 676 of the 1051 responses (64\%) exceeded 122.6
   (pre-surgery average). The PROM survey was highly acceptable with 76\%
   (n = 2830/3739) of patients rating 8/10 or above for acceptability.
   Fourteen patient driven recommendations were then co-developed.
   Conclusion Administering PROMS electronically for elective surgery
   hospital patients was feasible, acceptable and discriminated changes in
   surgical recovery over time. Patient co-design and involvement provided
   innovative and practical solutions to implementation and new
   recommendations for implementation. Trial Registration and Ethical
   Approval ACTRN12621000298819 (Phase I and II) and ACTRN12621000969864

Abstract = {Traffic light plays an important role in ensuring the safety of road
   users particularly at road intersections. Therefore, it is crucial to
   make sure that the traffic light is operational as soon as possible when
   traffic lights become faulty. Faulty traffic lights may cause
   inconvenience to motorists and put them in dangerous situations
   especially during peak hours. When traffic lights are faulty,
   authorities are notified by motorists who would call or send a text
   message to the number attached to the faulty traffic lights. There are
   two problems that were identified in this situation. Firstly,
   authorities rely on the motorist to report on faulty traffic lights.
   Thus, the response time of the authorities to react to the faulty
   traffic light is dependent on the length of time that a motorist
   responds to a faulty traffic light. Secondly, motorist could have
   difficulties in describing the fault type and traffic light information
   due to language or lack of traffic signage. As a result, the traffic
   light maintenance personnel could have misunderstood the situation.
   Short messaging service is costly. Furthermore, the text from short
   messaging service are limited and unable to provide rich information to
   the authorities. This paper presents the development progress of a
   proposed traffic light failure notification system called TrafficSys.
   TrafficSys was developed using the waterfall development methodology.
   TrafficSys system consists of a mobile application that is used by
   traffic light contractors and a desktop-based application that is used
   by traffic light technicians. TrafficSys notifies faulty traffic lights
   to the users via email through push notification. The content of the
   email provides information to the users such as location of the faulty
   traffic light via Google Map and also the fault type. The design of
   TrafficSys system is simple and minimal. Thus, the results of the
   usability testing have indicated that TrafficSys is an easy to use
   system and that the information provided by TrafficSys is clear,
   understandable and well-organized.},

Abstract = {A hot is a piece of software that is usually installed on an infected
   machine without the user's knowledge. A hot is controlled remotely by
   the attacker under a Command and Control structure. Recent statistics
   show that bots represent one of the fastest growing threats to our
   network by performing malicious activities such as email spamming or
   keylogging. However, few hot detection techniques have been developed to
   date. In this paper, we investigate a behavioural algorithm to detect a
   single hot that uses keylogging activity. Our approach involves the use
   of function calls analysis for the detection of the hot with a
   keylogging component. Correlation of the frequency of function calls
   made by the hot with other system signals during a specified time-window
   is performed to enhance the detection scheme. We perform a range of
   experiments with the spybot. Our results show that there is a high
   correlation between some function calls executed by this hot which
   indicates abnormal activity in our system.},

Abstract = {Malaysia urbanization rate has been growing fast due to rapid
   development and modernization (Economy Planning Unit, 2015) (World Bank,
   2015). With the fast growing urban population, the property crimes
   associated also rises at an alarming rate (United Nations Human
   Settlements Program, 2007) (Mohit Mohammad Abdul, Elsawahli H. Mohamed
   Hassan, 2015) (Ministry of Home Affairs, 2015). Video surveillance
   system is one of the trusted and efficient security systems to protect
   people and property against criminal (Varij Ken, 2015). Three problems
   and issues regarding current video surveillance system are
   functionality, flexibility and efficiency. The aim of this project is to
   design and develop an embedded motion detecting video surveillance
   system and to produce a functioning prototype as the final result to
   solve these problems. In order to achieve the aim of this project, three
   objectives are set to be attained. These objectives are to design and
   develop a motion detection algorithm based on OpenCV library functions
   using camera as sensor, to process and execute the algorithm using an
   embedded micro-computer and to compare its processing performance with a
   PC and to enable wireless user alert using LAN and internet connection.
   The first objective is achieved as the motion detection algorithm
   designed and developed based on background subtraction method using
   camera sensor and openCV library function is proven to functioning well
   in detecting for motion changes. The algorithm performs successfully
   both in BeagleBone Black module and PC and is able to deliver outputs
   required for embedded motion detection video surveillance system. The
   second objective is achieved as BeagleBone Black (BBB) module, a
   micro-computer embedded system is used as main processor for the
   embedded motion-detecting video surveillance system. The BBB module is
   able to process and execute the motion detection algorithm designed with
   image processing functions from OpenCV library. The third objective is
   achieved as embedded motion-detecting video surveillance system is
   equipped with wireless user alert function using local area network and
   internet connection. The system is able to send real-time alert to the
   user via email attached with the image captured and detected as a threat
   by the system},

Title = {WFP-Collector: Automated dataset collection framework for website
   fingerprinting evaluations on Tor Browser},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Website Fingerprinting (WFP) is a technique that analyses browsing
   network traffic to infer a webpage that a user browsed in Tor Browser. A
   sufficiently large and clean dataset is essential for quality and
   accurate WFP experiments. Thus, there is a corresponding need to
   automate the dataset collection, filtering, and validation processes.
   This work introduces a new paradigm, WFP-Collector, an automatic dataset
   collection framework for WFP experiments. WFP-Collector enables
   researchers to automatically (1) create a visit database for webpage
   crawling, (2) collect various data and log for in-depth analysis, (3)
   webpage visits in tablet and mobile browsing modes, (4) throttle network
   bandwidth and latency performance, (5) validate and filter the collected
   data, (6) compress and upload the collected data to cloud storage, and
   (7) completion notification using Telegram and email. We developed a
   proof-of-concept of the WFP framework for simulation and comparison. We
   found that the WFP-Collector framework collects nine data items and
   produces over 55\% larger collected data size than existing approaches.
   The captured packet size in tablet and mobile browsing modes is up to
   57.5\% smaller than in desktop mode. Moreover, the file compression in
   WFP-Collector can reduce up to 39.9\% of the storage space required for
   data collection.(c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on

Title = {RETRACTED: Internet of Things with Deep Learning-Based Face Recognition
   Approach for Authentication in Control Medical Systems (Retracted
   Article)},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {FEB 12},
Abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) with deep learning (DL) is drastically growing
   and plays a significant role in many applications, including medical and
   healthcare systems. It can help users in this field get an advantage in
   terms of enhanced touchless authentication, especially in spreading
   infectious diseases like coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Even
   though there is a number of available security systems, they suffer from
   one or more of issues, such as identity fraud, loss of keys and
   passwords, or spreading diseases through touch authentication tools. To
   overcome these issues, IoT-based intelligent control medical
   authentication systems using DL models are proposed to enhance the
   security factor of medical and healthcare places effectively. This work
   applies IoT with DL models to recognize human faces for authentication
   in smart control medical systems. We use Raspberry Pi (RPi) because it
   has low cost and acts as the main controller in this system. The
   installation of a smart control system using general-purpose
   input/output (GPIO) pins of RPi also enhanced the antitheft for smart
   locks, and the RPi is connected to smart doors. For user authentication,
   a camera module is used to capture the face image and compare them with
   database images for getting access. The proposed approach performs face
   detection using the Haar cascade techniques, while for face recognition,
   the system comprises the following steps. The first step is the facial
   feature extraction step, which is done using the pretrained CNN models
   (ResNet-50 and VGG-16) along with linear binary pattern histogram (LBPH)
   algorithm. The second step is the classification step which can be done
   using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Only classified face as
   genuine leads to unlock the door; otherwise, the door is locked, and the
   system sends a notification email to the home/medical place with
   detected face images and stores the detected person name and time
   information on the SQL database. The comparative study of this work
   shows that the approach achieved 99.56\% accuracy compared with some
   different related methods.},

Abstract = {Against a backdrop of growing concern about the protection of consumer
   data as it is transferred to call centres in offshore locations, this
   article examines data protection (DP) compliance in the multi-client
   outsourced call centre. Using an in-depth single case study of a South
   African outsourcer and drawing on the now extensive body of call centre
   research, it argues that routine DP compliance is predominantly driven
   by the employment relationship and the client contract. With no research
   of this nature ever having been undertaken previously, it is argued that
   compliance is affected by the manner in which employees are paid,
   contracted and performance managed. This study also confirms that the
   employment relationship is an information security measure for
   organisations.

Abstract = {Information processing in the era of big data is inseparable from the
   effective support of scientific computing. Complex scientific computing
   requires cloud computing to provide computing resources. One of the core
   foundations of Cloud computing is secure and reliable remote access
   technology. Users often log in to the remote server for scientific
   calculation. However, when users log in with public key, the steps are
   cumbersome. Therefore, this project develops a secure shell remote
   access information system for virtualized computing environment, which
   is called SSHRA for short. The system enables users to log in to the
   remote server more conveniently. The system can generate the
   corresponding certificate according to the public key provided by the
   user. Users use certificates for remote login. Users can obtain
   certificates through web or email. In addition, this system also designs
   an intelligent connection between multi hop servers. The system improves
   the security of remote login by limiting the IP, validity and available
   commands of the certificate. After users log in to the remote server
   with the certificate provided by the system, they can use commands to
   perform related operations. The system is developed based on open source
   software, so it has good scalability.},

Abstract = {Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are frequently viewed as a tool for
   democratizing education and job training. However, their effectiveness
   is largely untested. We report on the first randomized evaluation of a
   job training program offering cost-free access to curated, short
   Coursera MOOCs and certificates. We find low course completion rates
   (10\%), with males and wealthier individuals more likely to complete a
   course. Personalized reminders did not increase treatment take-up over a
   simple, standardized email reminder. Treatment has no significant effect
   on labour market outcomes roughly two years after the program. However,
   we find marginally significant evidence that treatment increases
   post-secondary education enrolment by 11\%. Evidence on mechanisms
   suggests that this may be operating partially through the program
   motivating individuals who lacked sufficient skills to pursue further
   specialization.},

Abstract = {American skullcap (Scutellaria lateriflora) is a popular herb in
   traditional medicine systems and western materia medica for the
   treatment of anxiety and related disorders. It is reported to be one of
   the most widely used medicinal herbs, with anecdotal evidence for
   minimal side-effects and with no known toxicity. This article summarises
   the results of a pilot survey conducted amongst herbal medicine
   practitioners on their use of S. lateriflora.
   An email survey was conducted amongst herbal medicine practitioners in
   the UK and Ireland. It aimed to gather information on the extent of and
   indications for, current use of S. lateriflora, its perceived
   effectiveness and its safety. Herbal medicine practitioners were
   selected from the membership list of the National Institute of Medical
   Herbalists (NIMH). All members with identifiable email addresses were
   contacted (n = 377) and responses were received from 62 (a 16\% response
   rate).
   The results of the survey suggested that S. lateriflora is highly
   regarded amongst herbal medicine practitioners as an effective
   intervention for reducing anxiety and stress and is commonly prescribed
   for these conditions and related co-morbidities. The results were not
   conclusive as the response rate was low and respondents were only those
   with email access. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Development and testing of a remote hybrid SMS/web-based perioperative
   messenger: A mixed-methods study},
Journal = {DIGITAL HEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},
Abstract = {Background Perioperative messengers as tools for hospitals to
   communicate with patients' loved ones during surgery have been described
   in form of pagers, SMS, email, and apps. The approach of combining
   multiple means of communication to create a secure and reliable
   messenger promises several advantages and has not been investigated to
   date.Objective The aim was to develop and test the technical feasibility
   and acceptance of a remote hybrid SMS/web-based perioperative messenger
   that keeps patients' loved ones informed around the time of
   surgery.Methods Three focus groups were held with six physicians, five
   nurses, and 11 members of the Austrian Patient Council separately to
   understand their concerns and needs regarding the perioperative
   messenger. Their input was used to develop the perioperative messenger.
   Twenty-five patients and their selected loved one tested the messenger
   in a feasibility study. Data were collected between September 2021 and
   August 2023.Results Focus groups indicated that the most important
   characteristics of a messenger were transparent and prompt
   communication, ease-of-use, data security, and no additional workload
   for healthcare professionals. Our developed perioperative messenger uses
   SMS notifications to link to new information on a secure web platform.
   Participating patients were aged between 18 and 78, their loved ones
   between 18 and 71. Thirteen patients and 15 loved ones were female. A
   total of 173 messages regarding the 25 surgeries were sent, 99\% of
   which were read on a mobile device. The median time between sending and
   reading surgery-related messages was 63s. All loved ones were either
   ``fairly satisfied{''} or ``very satisfied{''}.Conclusion The idea of a
   perioperative messenger was received positively by physicians, nurses,
   and members of the Austrian Patient Council. The developed SMS/web-based
   hybrid messenger system for receiving perioperative updates was shown to
   be feasible, and of interest and satisfaction to the loved ones.},

Abstract = {The Internet has established itself as an affordable, extremely viable
   and ubiquitous communications network that can be easily accessed from
   virtually any point in the world. This makes it ideally suited for
   medical image communications. Issues regarding security and
   confidentiality of information on the Internet, however, need to be
   addressed for both occasional, individual users and consistent
   enterprise-wide users. In addition, the limited bandwidth of most
   Internet connections must be factored into the development of a
   realistic user-model and resulting protocol. Open architecture issues
   must also be considered so that images can be communicated to recipients
   who do not have similar programs. Further, application-specific software
   is required to integrate image acquisition, encryption and transmission
   into a single, streamlined process.
   Using Photomailer(TM) software provided by PhysiTel Inc., the authors
   investigated the use of sending secured still images over the Internet.
   The scope of their investigation covered the use of the Internet for
   communicating images for consultation, referral, mentoring and
   education. Photomailer(TM) software was used at several local and remote
   sites. The program was used for both sending and receiving images. It
   was also used for sending images to recipients who did not have
   Photomailer(TM), but instead relied on conventional email programs.
   The results of the investigation demonstrated that using products such
   as Photomailer(TM), images could be quickly and easily communicated from
   one location to another via the Internet. In addition, the investigators
   were able to retrieve images off of their existing email accounts,
   thereby providing greater flexibility and convenience than other systems
   which require scheduled transmission of information on dedicated
   systems. We conclude that Photomailer(TM) and similar products may
   provide a significant benefit and improve communications among
   colleagues, providing an inexpensive means of sending secured images on
   the Internet.},

Abstract = {Security attacks continue to emerge on daily basis due to the fast
   growth in the number of smart devices and mobile applications. Attacks
   take different malware forms such as Spyware and Trojan exploiting
   different operating system vulnerabilities, specially the well known
   vulnerable operating system; Android OS. In this paper, we study the
   malicious use of the ``NotificationListener{''} service in Android 4.3
   and 5.0. A Trojan application, known as SMS backup, is developed to spy
   the notifications of other applications. Such an application requires
   only two permissions that include ``Notification Access{''} and
   ``Internet{''}. These permissions are used to extract and send user's
   messages of other applications to the attacker's email through Internet.
   Our malware is able to alter and/or delete the notification before being
   displayed. For experimental results, the malware was tested against
   notifications of WhatsApp, BBM, SMS, and Facebook messenger using
   different Android versions including Lollipop 5.0. Experiments show that
   our malware succeeded against all the tested applications running
   Android version 4.3. Moreover, BBM and SMS messages are still
   extractable in the newer version of Android (Lollipop 5.0). (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {This study was initiated to examine the feasibility of providing
   multimedia mail, in particular video mail, on the existing World Wide
   Web platform. In this instance, the Web browser will act as the user
   agent of the mailing system. With this, users will be able to compose,
   send and read video mail directly on the Web. This paper examines a
   number of possible system architectures that can be employed for the
   development of video mail. Based on the following key issues:
   portability of system, flexibility of system, Internet standard support,
   security and authentication, and message compression and storage, a
   final architecture was selected to build video mail. The approach taken
   is that the system will be interfaced to the Web using a standard
   HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server and a standard Web browser.
   This is achieved through the use of Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
   programs and forms which reside in a standard HTTP server to provide the
   functionality of video mail, and a separate mail server for the storage
   and management of messages. This will cause the HTTP server to behave as
   if it is an electronic mail (E-mail) system.
   Video mail has been successfully implemented at the School of Applied
   Science, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. The development
   work has been carried out on a Sun SPARC5 workstation and the Typhoon
   relational database system was used to construct the mail server. All
   software codes were written in C or C++. A video capturing application
   used in conjunction with a SunVideo card has been developed for video
   and audio recording. The paper also addresses implementation issues
   pertaining to the use of CGI programs, mail server development, and
   video and audio management. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.},

Abstract = {A CAPTCHA is a puzzle that is easy for humans but hard to solve for
   computers. A formal framework, modelling CAPTCHA puzzles (as hard AI
   problems), was introduced by Ahn, Blum, Hopper, and Lang-ford ({[}1],
   Eurocrypt 2003). Despite their attractive features and wide adoption in
   practice, the use of CAPTCHA puzzles for general cryptographic
   applications has been limited.
   In this work, we explore various ways to formally model CAPTCHA puzzles
   and their human component and explore new applications for CAPTCHA. We
   show that by defining CAPTCHA with additional (strong but realistic)
   properties, it is possible to broaden CAPTCHA applicability, including
   using it to learning a machine's ``secret internal state.{''} To
   facilitate this, we introduce the notion of an human-extractable
   CAPTCHA, which we believe may be of independent interest. We show that
   this type of CAPTCHA yields a constant round protocol for fully
   concurrent non-malleable zero-knowledge. To enable this we also define
   and construct a CAPTCHA-based commitment scheme which admits ``straight
   line{''} extraction. We also explore CAPTCHA definitions in the setting
   of Universal Composability (UC). We show that there are two
   (incomparable) ways to model CAPTCHA within the UC framework that lead
   to different results. In particular, we show that in the so called
   indirect access model, for every polynomial time functionality F there
   exists a protocol that UC-realizes F using human-extractable CAPTCHA,
   while for the so-called direct access model, UC is impossible, even with
   the help of human-extractable CAPTCHA.
   The security of our constructions using human-extractable CAPTCHA is
   proven against the (standard) class of all polynomial time
   adversaries.In contrast, most previous works guarantee security only
   against a very limited class of adversaries, called the conservative
   adversaries.},

Title = {Technology and Continuous Glucose Monitoring Access, Literacy, and Use
   Among Patients at the Diabetes Center of an Inner-City Safety-Net
   Hospital: Mixed Methods Study},
Journal = {JMIR DIABETES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {9},
Abstract = {Background: Despite the existence of an increasing array of digital
   technologies and tools for diabetes management, there are disparities in
   access to and uptake and use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)
   devices, particularly for those most at risk of poor diabetes outcomes.
   Objective: This study aims to assess communication technology and CGM
   access, literacy, and use among patients receiving treatment for
   diabetes at an inner-city safety-net hospital. Methods: A survey on
   digital technology ownership and use was self-administered by 75 adults
   with type 1 and type 2 diabetes at the diabetes clinic of Grady Memorial
   Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. In-depth interviews were conducted with
   16\% (12/75) of these patient participants and 6 health care providers
   (HCPs) to obtain additional insights into the use of communication
   technology and CGM to support diabetes self-management. Results: Most
   participants were African American (66/75, 88\%), over half (39/75,
   52\%) were unemployed or working part time, and 29\% (22/75) had no
   health insurance coverage, while 61\% (46/75) had federal coverage.
   Smartphone ownership and use were near universal; texting and email use
   were common (63/75, 84\% in both cases). Ownership and use of tablets
   and computers and use and daily use of various forms of media were more
   prevalent among younger participants and those with type 1 diabetes, who
   also rated them as easier to use. Technology use specifically for
   diabetes and health management was low. Participants were supportive of
   a potential smartphone app for diabetes management, with a high interest
   in such an app helping them track blood sugar levels and communicate
   with their care teams. Younger participants showed higher levels of
   interest, perceived value, and self-efficacy for using an app with these
   capabilities. History of CGM use was reported by 56\% (42/75) of the
   participants, although half (20/42, 48\%) had discontinued use, above
   all due to the cost of the device and issues with its adhesive. Nonuse
   was primarily dueto not being offered CGM by their HCP. Reasons given
   for continued use included convenience, improved blood glucose control,
   and better tracking of blood glucose. The in-depth interviews (n=18)
   revealed high levels of satisfaction with CGM by users and supported the
   survey findings regarding reasons for continued use. They also
   highlighted the value of CGM data to enhance communication between
   patients and HCPs. Conclusions:Smartphone ownership was near universal
   among patients receiving care at an inner-city hospital. Alongside the
   need to address barriers to CGM access and continued use, there is an
   opportunity to leverage increased access to communication technology in
   combination with CGM to improve diabetes outcomesamong underresourced
   populations.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a modular system of wireless monitoring of
   physiological and ambient conditions based on Internet of Things (IoT).
   It is specially designed for elderly people and people with chronic
   diseases to promote their independent living. The system consists of a
   network of physiological and home ambient sensors developed under
   standard IoT protocols. These sensors are designed and manufactured at
   the laboratory with low-cost components. In addition, commercial sensors
   can be added according to the requirements of the patient. The system
   also provides a web based user interface for medical and family
   caregivers. It displays real time data and it includes an alarm system
   to report unsafe events via email. The caregiver can also see historical
   data with the possibility to compare all the parameters of a certain day
   and time. Furthermore, a home automation system was proposed to control
   home devices to improve home safety. The evaluation of the system was
   performed under a controlled environment at the laboratory in pilot
   tests before being tested in patients.},

Abstract = {Background. The recent surge in phishing attacks keeps undermining the
   effectiveness of the traditional anti-phishing blacklist approaches.
   On-device anti-phishing solutions are gaining popularity as they offer
   faster phishing detection locally.
   Aim. We aim to eliminate the delay in recognizing and recording phishing
   campaigns in databases via on-device solutions that identify phishing
   sites immediately when encountered by the user rather than waiting for a
   web crawler's scan to finish. Additionally, utilizing operating
   system-specific resources and frameworks, we aim to minimize the impact
   on system performance and depend on local processing to protect user
   privacy.
   Method. We propose a phishing detection solution that uses a combination
   of computer vision and on-device machine learning models to analyze
   websites in real time. Our reference-based approach analyzes the visual
   content of webpages, identifying phishing attempts through layout
   analysis, credential input areas detection, and brand impersonation
   criteria combination.
   Results. Our case study shows it's feasible to perform background
   processing on-device continuously, for the case of the web browser
   requiring the resource use of 16\% of a single CPU core and less than
   84MB of RAM on Apple M1 while maintaining the accuracy of brand logo
   detection at 46.6\% (comparable with baselines), and of Credential
   Requiring Page detection at 98.1\% (improving the baseline by 3.1\%),
   within the test dataset.
   Conclusions. Our results demonstrate the potential of on-device,
   real-time phishing detection systems to enhance cybersecurity defensive
   technologies and extend the scope of phishing detection to more similar
   regions of interest, e.g., email clients and messenger windows.},

Abstract = {At present, researches on gestures at home and abroad mostly focus on
   the study of the hand, and there is less research on facial gestures.
   Based on the premise of multi-channel human-computer interaction and the
   rapid development of artificial intelligence, facial gestures based on
   facial features are proposed. Firstly, the definition of facial gestures
   and the recognition of facial gestures, as well as the introduction of
   facial gesture processing, are analyzed. Then facial detection
   technology based on Face++ and a set of interactive gestures based on
   facial features are designed according to the detected facial features,
   to achieve the interaction with the computer. Finally, a facial gesture
   application is implemented in Java language and the facial gesture
   technology is tested and analyzed. The results show that facial gestures
   are more conducive to hands-on disability for people with disabilities
   to more easily interact with computers and reduce the burden on their
   hands.},

Title = {Detection and Mitigation of Low-Rate Denial-of-Service Attacks: A Survey},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {76648-76668},
Abstract = {The potential for being the target of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks is
   one of the most severe security threats on the Internet. Attackers have
   been modifying their attack format over the years, damaging specific
   conditions of operating systems and protocols in an attempt to deny or
   diminish the quality of the service provided to legitimate users.
   Nowadays, attacks are stealthier and mimic legitimate user traffic in
   such a way that detection mechanisms against High-rate DoS attacks are
   no longer sufficient. This evolving type of attack, known as LDoS
   (Low-rate Denial of Service) attacks, has the potential to produce more
   damage than its predecessor due to its stealth nature and the lack of
   suitable detection and defense methods. This survey summarizes and
   complements previous studies and surveys related to this specific type
   of attack. First, we propose a taxonomy of the LDoS attacks, which were
   divided into three broad categories based on their modus operandi: QoS
   attacks, Slow rate attacks, and Service queue attacks. Next, we detail
   numerous detection mechanisms and counter-measures available against
   eight types of LDoS attacks. More specifically, we describe the methods
   used to throttle the attack traffic. Finally, we provide a feature
   comparison table for some existing attack tools. This survey aims at
   providing an extensive review of the literature for helping researchers
   and network administrators find up-to-date knowledge on LDoS attacks.},

Journal = {PROCESSES},
Year = {2025},

Abstract = {Green hydrogen is a promising energy vector for industrial applications.
   However, hydrogen leaks can occur causing greenhouse effects and posing
   safety risks for operators and local communities, potentially leading to
   legal liabilities. Industry 4.0 focuses on digital industrial
   modernization, while Industry 5.0 emphasizes collaborative,
   human-centered, and sustainable processes. This study developed and
   analyzed an Industry 5.0 proof of concept as an additional safety layer
   for hydrogen leak management. The proof of concept was implemented using
   Raspberry Pi microcomputers, integrated computer vision, and OpenAI
   GPT-3 for dynamic email communication. A legal liability analysis for
   Chile and Spain identified potential challenges in transitioning the
   system into a market-ready product. The findings suggest the system
   should act as a complementary safety layer rather than a primary
   detection system to mitigate legal liability risks, as operational
   deployment without full certification and validation could lead to
   malfunctions. This study illustrated how hydrogen detection and
   management can be integrated into Industry 5.0 smart systems. With
   growing global interest in sustainable engineering and AI regulation, as
   reflected in Regulation (EU) 2024/1689, legal considerations over
   technologies like the one presented in this study are becoming
   increasingly relevant.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we describe and evaluate Hide-as-you-Type, a prototype
   steganographic system, designed to hide secret bits in the digest chains
   of natural language sentences. Through an interactive embedding process
   that incorporates keyed hash functions and human reviewed sentences, the
   system generates two innocuous natural language carriers that ultimately
   optimise payload secrecy. Conventionally, the first carrier
   (carrier-text) hosts a payload of secret bits. The second carrier,
   referred to as an open-stego-key, hosts sentences used as keys to
   extract a payload from a carrier-text. Notable aspects of our approach
   include the scope to offset embedding distortion from a carrier-text to
   an open-stego-key, as well as the scope to resize a carrier-text for
   optimal transmission via capacity constrained channels (e.g. Twitter,
   SMS), at the expense of a larger open-stego-key, that is transmitted via
   an alternative channel (e.g. social media, blog, forum, email).},

Title = {Identifying the relationship between Travel Agent's Web Service Quality
   and E-brand Reputation},

Abstract = {E-travel websites have progressively played a significant role in the
   tourism industry because travelers can easily book a holiday trip
   anywhere at their fingertips. However, studies related to the
   relationship between e-service quality and e-reputation of travel agency
   websites are limited. This study investigates the components of
   e-service quality of travel agency websites and explores how e-service
   quality may influence e-reputation. Based on hierarchical factor
   analysis, website security, special deal giving, the website's
   convenience, and booking flexibility were assigned as the second-order
   factors of e-service quality. A sample of 444 online users was collected
   using online questionnaires that were distributed via a social media
   platform (Facebook) and by email. Several analytical methods were
   performed to evaluate the associations among the hypothesized variables,
   including factor analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM). The
   empirical research results revealed that website convenience, booking
   flexibility, special deal, and website security all significantly
   influence e-brand reputation. Among those four factors, website
   convenience and booking flexibility were found to be the most
   influential factors. In terms of convenience, the results of our study
   suggest that a website should provide user-friendly environments and
   functions to help customers search for what customers need easily and
   quickly. Additionally, we found that e-travel agents may enhance booking
   flexibility by providing flexible returns or exchange policies to allow
   customers to change their itineraries. The adoption of these practices
   will enhance travel websites, and the yield will be improved in both
   service quality and e-brand reputation.},

Title = {Healthcare Workers' Adherence and Attitudes Toward the Adherence to
   COVID-19 Precautionary Guidelines Post-Vaccination: A Cross-Sectional
   Pilot Study},
Journal = {WORKPLACE HEALTH \& SAFETY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {72},
Number = {5},
Pages = {170-177},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) have shown increased adherence to
   infection control practices during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there
   is a need to assess their adherence to and attitude toward COVID-19
   guidelines after being vaccinated. The purpose of this pilot study is to
   assess the adherence to and attitudes toward the adherence to COVID-19
   guidelines among HCWs who have been vaccinated.Methods: A retrospective
   cross-sectional design was employed. One hundred and eight participants
   were recruited via email from a medical center in the Midwest United
   States. The participants completed online surveys measuring the level of
   adherence to and attitudes toward the adherence to COVID-19 guidelines.
   The response rate was 5.4\%.Findings: Most participants were female
   (73.1\%) and white (82.4\%). The participants adhered to COVID-19
   guidelines 79.7\% of the time. The most frequently followed guidelines
   were performing hand hygiene, wearing a respirator or well-fitting mask
   in areas where patients may be present, and wearing eye protection when
   entering the room for a patient with suspected or confirmed COVID-19
   infection. The least performed precautions were performing COVID-19
   testing after exposure to a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case and
   maintaining social distancing. There was a significant decrease in the
   perceived importance of adherence to COVID-19 precautions
   post-vaccination (p <.001, 95\% CI {[}-0.78, -0.35]).Conclusions: The
   increased perception of safety after receiving COVID-19 vaccination may
   negatively influence HCWs' adherence to COVID-19 precautionary
   guidelines. Continuous education and monitoring of HCWs' safety
   practices are important to influence HCWs' attitudes to adhere to
   COVID-19 precautions, particularly after vaccination.},

Title = {VOCs in cleaning products used in age care and social facilities:
   Identification of hazardous substances},
Journal = {AIMS ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},

Pages = {402-417},
Abstract = {Prior to the nationwide survey on indoor air quality in 100 age care and
   social facilities across France, which is planned for 2019, a
   questionnaire was sent by email to the directors of all 18,432
   institutions of these types to determine the potential emission sources
   of indoor pollutants. Among these, cleaning practices and cleaning
   products were targeted. The questionnaire included items regarding
   cleaning frequency and periods, cleaning techniques, storage areas, the
   use of air fresheners and the commercial names of the products used. A
   total of 2140 questionnaires were collected and processed, and 1109
   cleaning products, along with their commercial names, were listed. From
   them, 341 different products were identified, for which 299 safety data
   sheets (SDSs) were available and analyzed. A total of 216 different
   chemical substances were identified in the SDSs. The boiling points were
   retrieved to classify the substances according to their volatility.
   Finally, information regarding their hazard classification was
   collected, and six categories of human health effects were considered. A
   total of 41 chemical substances were classified, among which 10 are
   carcinogenic, 6 are mutagenic, 1 has reproductive toxicity, 3 have
   specific target organ toxicity repeat exposure, 19 are possible
   endocrine disruptors, 14 are skin sensitizers, and 2 are respiratory
   sensitizers. Of these 41 chemicals, 51\% (n = 21) are volatile organic
   compounds (VOCs). Despite the limitations of using SDSs, which do not
   report the exact compositions of the products, this study shows that a
   large spectrum of volatile substances may be emitted from cleaning
   products used in age care and social facilities, which may have a
   potential impact on the indoor air quality.},

Abstract = {Background: Recruitment for research studies is a challenging endeavor
   that was further complicated by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.
   We launched a new multicenter birth cohort, Childhood Allergy and the
   NeOnatal Environment (CANOE), supported by the National Institutes of
   Health in January 2020 across 4 sites. Although the pandemic temporarily
   halted clinical research, we restructured the study and instituted novel
   recruitment methods that we hypothesized would enable brisk enrollment
   when research activities resumed. Objective: We sought to develop
   protocol modifications and recruitment methods that promote successful
   recruitment of diverse populations in clinical research despite a global
   pandemic. Methods: Even though study activities were suspended, we
   modified recruitment strategies to limit in-person contact, shifting
   toward alternative HIPAA-compliant methods such as clinician referrals,
   institutional social media, and telemedicine screening and consent
   procedures. Protocol changes included reducing the frequency of
   in-person visits, leveraging clinical care visits to collect
   biospecimens, expanded self-collection of samples at home, and making
   study materials available online. Results: Remote methods, including
   targeted social media posts, mailed letters, and email, combined with
   in-clinic recruitment with modifications for social distancing led to
   successful recruitment at all sites. Rates of consent have been similar
   across recruitment sites, with the highest rates of enrollment of
   mother-infant dyads realized by sites that implemented multiple
   recruitment strategies. Conclusions: Study procedures that prioritize
   health and safety measures such as social distancing, study participant
   convenience, and use diverse recruitment strategies enable successful
   enrollment of pregnant women and their newborns into clinical research
   while adhering to public health restrictions during a global pandemic.

Abstract = {Helicopter Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS) have achieved
   greater acceptance in the user community over the past decade as an
   effective tool to enhance maintainability, reduce costs, and improve
   flight safety. As more HUMS are fielded on operational Army and Navy
   aircraft, operators and maintainers are becoming familiar with the
   flexibility and efficiencies this technology offers. This paper presents
   the uses and field experiences of a new HUMS capability termed the HUMS
   In-Flight Reporting System (HIRS). The HIRS provides interactive two-way
   communications directly with the HUMS for transmitting and querying
   maintenance and safety data while the aircraft is airborne. The system
   consists of Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) satellite communications
   equipment and associated ground-based software. The HIRS has been
   installed and is flying onboard a Navy SH-60B helicopter for evaluation
   as part of the Joint Advanced Health and Usage Monitoring System
   (JAHUMS) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) Program.
   The concepts of operation (CONOPS) and as-flown operational scenarios
   illustrate this powerful real-time HUMS satellite data communications
   tool. Actual SH-60B flight data and operations are presented along with
   the ground station interface. The ground station includes real-time
   graphing of HUMS parameters, remote control of HUMS transmission mode,
   and automatic takeoff, landing, and exceedance notification via email.
   Another aspect is COTS product insertion into an open architecture HUMS
   process.},

Abstract = {Objectives Effective communication between surgeons and
   anesthesiologists is critical for high-quality, safe, and efficient
   perioperative patient care. Despite widespread implementation of
   surgical safety checklists and time-outs, ineffective team communication
   remains a leading cause of patient safety events in the operating room.
   To promote effective communication, we conducted a pilot trial of a
   ``virtual huddle{''} between anesthesiologists and surgeons.Methods
   Attending anesthesiologists and surgeons at an academic medical center
   were recruited by email to participate in this feasibility trial. An
   electronic health record-based smartphone application was utilized to
   create secure group chats among trial participants the day before a
   surgery. Text notifications connected a surgeon/anesthesiologist pair in
   order to introduce colleagues, facilitate a preoperative virtual huddle,
   and enable open-ended, text message-based communication. A 5-point
   Likert scale-based survey with a free-text component was used to
   evaluate the utility of the virtual huddle and usability of the
   electronic platform.Results A total of 51 unique virtual huddles
   occurred between 16 surgeons and 12 anesthesiologists over 99
   operations. All postintervention survey questions received a positive
   rating (range: 3.50/5.00-4.53/5.00) and the virtual huddle was
   considered to be easy to use (4.47/5.00), improve attending-to-attending
   communication (4.29/5.00), and improve patient care (4.22/5.00). There
   were no statistically significant differences in the ratings between
   surgery and anesthesia. In thematic analysis of qualitative survey
   results, Participants indicated the intervention was particularly useful
   in interdisciplinary relationship-building and reducing room turnover.
   The huddle was less useful for simple, routine cases or when
   participation was one sided.Conclusion A preoperative virtual huddle may
   be a simple and effective intervention to improve communication and
   teamwork in the operating room. Further study and consideration of
   broader implementation is warranted.},

Abstract = {Phishing emails are a significant threat to organizations, with over
   90\% of cyber attacks starting from a malicious email. Despite built-in
   security measures, relying solely on these defenses can leave
   organizations vulnerable to cybercriminals who exploit human nature and
   the lack of tight security. Phishing emails, designed to deceive
   recipients into disclosing personal and financial information, represent
   a significant cybersecurity challenge. This paper introduces a
   comprehensive dataset curated explicitly for detecting phishing emails,
   featuring a collection of authentic and phishing emails. The dataset
   includes a broad spectrum of phishing techniques, such as sophisticated
   social engineering tactics, impersonation of reputable entities, and
   using urgent or threatening language to manipulate recipients. Phishing
   emails were collected to cover various scenarios, including financial
   fraud, account verification, and malware dissemination attempts. Our
   analysis involves a range of classical machine learning models alongside
   exploratory analysis with LLMs. The performance of these models was
   rigorously evaluated to furnish a comparative analysis of their
   detection capabilities. The dataset, one of the largest of its kind,
   offers a significant resource for researchers and cybersecurity
   professionals aiming to advance phishing detection methods. The dataset
   used in this research is publicly available, enabling further
   exploration and replication of the findings by the research community

Abstract = {We introduce a new concept called brokered delegation. Brokered
   delegation allows users to flexibly delegate credentials and rights for
   a range of service providers to other users and third parties. We
   explore how brokered delegation can be implemented using novel trusted
   execution environments (TEEs). We introduce a system called DELEGATEE
   that enables users (Delegatees) to log into different online services
   using the credentials of other users (Owners). Credentials in DELEGATEE
   are never revealed to Delegatees and Owners can restrict access to their
   accounts using a range of rich, contextually dependent delegation
   policies.
   DELEGATEE fundamentally shifts existing access control models for
   centralized online services. It does so by using TEEs to permit access
   delegation at the user's discretion. DELEGATEE thus effectively reduces
   mandatory access control (MAC) in this context to discretionary access
   control (DAC). The system demonstrates the significant potential for
   TEEs to create new forms of resource sharing around online services
   without the direct support from those services.
   We present a full implementation of DELEGATEE using Intel SGX and
   demonstrate its use in four real-world applications: email access
   (SMTP/IMAP), restricted website access using a HTTPS proxy,
   e-banking/credit card, and a third-party payment system (PayPal).},

Abstract = {Background Human resource management in hospitals has become
   increasingly challenging. Nursing staff are a major asset in achieving
   the quality and safety objectives of health care institutions. The
   concept of Magnet Hospitals seeks to promote a positive work
   environment. Despite knowledge of the Magnet Hospital concept, the
   reasons for the lack of applying the concept within Belgian nursing
   departments is matter for debate. Objectives/ Aims/ Hypotheses : The aim
   was to explore whether Magnet Hospital principles and values were
   applicable to a nursing department within a Belgian University Hospital
   Centre. Design A mixed methods approach involving both qualitative and
   quantitative methodology was adopted. Methods Data were collected across
   two sites of a University Hospital. For the quantitative phase, a
   magnetism measurement questionnaire was administered to a convenience
   sample of nurses from both sites using email and the hospital intranet.
   For the qualitative phase, a convenience sample of head nurses from
   across the two sites were recruited by email and agreed to attend
   interviews. Results For the quantitative phase, scores obtained show a
   limited magnetism among the nurses (n = 224). Out of the 18
   sub-dimensions, seven appear to be underdeveloped (score <50) compared
   to two developed (score> 75). The qualitative phase showed nine
   facilitators, nine barriers, and seven neutral constructs among surveyed
   head nurses (n = 17). These demonstrate a marked interest in the
   concept, but constraints put forward imply that establishment of the
   concept would be premature or at least quite difficult within the
   institution. Conclusions Despite interest toward the concept, the
   implementation of Magnet Hospital within nursing departments currently
   seems difficult. However, these results shed light upon managerial,
   organisational, and scientific issues involved in using the concept of
   the Magnet Hospital within European hospitals. Impact statement
   Communication, unit management strategy and transition of human resource
   management, through a more human and less administrative approach, are
   essential for Magnet Hospital implementation.},

Abstract = {Tasks are central to information retrieval (IR) and drive interactions
   with search systems {[}2, 4, 10]. Understanding and modeling tasks helps
   these systems better support user needs {[}8, 9, 11]. This keynote
   focuses on search tasks, the emergence of generative artificial
   intelligence (AI), and the implications of recent work at their
   intersection for the future of search. Recent estimates suggest that
   half of Web search queries go unanswered, many of them connected to
   complex search tasks(1) that are ill-defined or multi-step and span
   several queries {[}6]. AI copilots, e.g., ChatGPT and Bing Chat, are
   emerging to address complex search tasks and many other challenges.
   These copilots are built on large foundation models such as GPT-4 and
   are being extended with skills and plugins. Copilots broaden the surface
   of tasks achievable via search, moving toward creation not just finding
   (e.g., interview preparation, email composition), and can make searchers
   more efficient and more successful.
   Users currently engage with AI copilots via natural language queries and
   dialog and the copilots generate answers with source attribution {[}7].
   However, in delegating responsibility for answer generation, searchers
   also lose some control over aspects of the search process, such as
   directly manipulating queries and examining lists of search results
   {[}1]. The efficiency gains from auto-generating a single, synthesized
   answer may also reduce opportunities for user learning and serendipity.
   A wholesale move to copilots for all search tasks is neither practical
   nor necessary: model inference is expensive, conversational interfaces
   are unfamiliar to many users in a search context, and traditional search
   already excels for many types of task. Instead, experiences that unite
   search and chat are becoming more common, enabling users to adjust the
   modality and other aspects (e.g., answer tone) based on the task.
   The rise of AI copilots creates many opportunities for IR, including
   aligning generated answers with user intent, tasks, and applications via
   human feedback {[}3]; understanding copilot usage, including functional
   fixedness {[}5]; using context and data to tailor responses to people
   and situations (e.g., grounding, personalization); new search
   experiences (e.g., unifying search and chat); reliability and safety
   (e.g., accuracy, bias); understanding impacts on user learning and
   agency; and evaluation (e.g., model-based feedback, searcher simulations
   {[}12], repeatability). Research in these and related areas will enable
   search systems to more effectively utilize new copilot technologies
   together with traditional search to help searchers better tackle a wider
   variety of tasks.},

Abstract = {Background: Reporting high-quality bariatric surgery outcomes depends on
   participant attrition and level of study participation among enrolled
   participants.
   Objectives: Our aims are to report participant attrition, active
   enrollment, and level of participation, and to evaluate pre-surgery
   sociodemographic, physical health, and psychosocial factors as
   predictors of attrition and level of participation through 5 years.
   Setting: The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 study which
   enrolled 2458 adults undergoing a first bariatric surgical procedure at
   1 of 6 US cites from 2006 through 2009.
   Methods: In-person research assessments were conducted pre-surgery and
   annually for five years. Extensive retention strategies including
   offering remote assessments (telephone, email, mail, or a combination)
   were fully implemented in 2009. Among living participants, including
   those inactivated, annual follow-up assessments were categorized as
   in-person, remote or missed through 5 years.
   Results: By year 5, 1.7\% of participants had died and 3.2\% had
   withdrawn or were inactivated by the study staff; thus, attrition was
   4.9\% (n = 121). Controlling for site and calendar year, missed
   assessments increased from 14.7\%-21.8\% between years 1 and 2 and then
   stayed relatively stable (20.8\%-19.6\%) for years 3-5. Younger age,
   male sex, White race, lower body mass index, smoking, illicit drug use,
   and higher weight loss expectations preoperatively were independently
   associated with a higher likelihood of a missed versus in-person
   assessment across follow-up.
   Conclusion: The LABS-2 participant attrition was low. The percentage of
   missed assessments did not increase after year 2, perhaps due to
   implementation of a comprehensive retention plan. Predictors of missed
   assessments highlight subgroups to target for focused retention efforts.

Title = {Understanding Patients' Intention to Use Digital Health Apps That
   Support Postdischarge Symptom Monitoring by Providers Among Patients
   With Acute Coronary Syndrome: Survey Study},
Journal = {JMIR HUMAN FACTORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN-MAR},
Abstract = {Background: After hospital discharge, patients with acute coronary
   syndrome (ACS) often experience symptoms that prompt them to seek acute
   medical attention. Early evaluation of postdischarge symptoms by health
   care providers may reduce unnecessary acute care utilization. However,
   hospital-initiated follow-up encounters are insufficient for timely
   detection and assessment of symptoms. While digital health tools can
   help address this issue, little is known about the intention to use such
   tools in ACS patients.
   Objective: This study aimed to assess ACS patients' intention to use
   digital health apps that support postdischarge symptom monitoring by
   health care providers and identify patient-perceived facilitators and
   barriers to app use.
   Methods: Using email invitations or phone calls, we recruited ACS
   patients discharged from a central Massachusetts health care system
   between December 2020 and April 2021, to participate in the study.
   Surveys were delivered online or via phone to individual participants.
   Demographics and access to technology were assessed. The intention to
   use a symptom monitoring app was assessed using 5-point Likert-type
   (from strongly agree to strongly disagree) items, such as ``If this app
   were available to me, I would use it.{''} Responses were compared across
   demographic subgroups and survey delivery methods. Two open-ended
   questions assessed perceived facilitators and barriers to app use, with
   responses analyzed using qualitative content analysis.
   Results: Among 100 respondents (response rate 8.1\%), 45 (45\%)
   completed the survey by phone. The respondents were on average 68 years
   old (SD 13 years), with 90\% (90/100) White, 39\% (39/100) women, and
   88\% (88/100) having access to the internet or a mobile phone. Most
   participants (65/100, 65\%) agreed or strongly agreed that they would
   use the app, among which 53 (82\%) would use the app as often as
   possible. The percentage of participants with the intention to use the
   app was 75\% among those aged 65-74 years and dropped to 44\% among
   those older than 75 years. The intention to use was higher in online
   survey respondents (vs phone survey respondents; odds ratio 3.07, 95\%
   CI 1.20-7.88) after adjusting for age and access to technology. The
   analysis of open-ended questions identified the following 4 main
   facilitators (motivations): (1) easily reaching providers, (2) accessing
   or providing information, (3) quickly reaching providers, and (4)
   consulting providers for symptoms, and the following 4 main barriers:
   (1) privacy/security concerns, (2) uncomfortable using technology, (3)
   user-unfriendly app interface, and (4) preference for in-person/phone
   care.
   Conclusions: There was a strong intention to use a symptom monitoring
   app postdischarge among ACS patients. However, this intent decreased in
   patients older than 75 years. The survey identified barriers related to
   technology use, privacy/security, and the care delivery mode. Further
   research is warranted to determine if such intent translates into app
   use, and better symptom management and health care quality.},

Abstract = {While e-health initiatives are poised to revolutionize delivery and
   access to mental health care, conducting clinical research online
   involves specific contextual and ethical considerations. Face-to-face
   psychosocial interventions can at times entail risk and have adverse
   psychoactive effects, something true for online mental health programs
   too. Risks associated with and specific to internet psychosocial
   interventions include potential breaches of confidentiality related to
   online communications (such as unencrypted email), data privacy and
   security, risks of self-selection and self-diagnosis as well as the
   shortcomings of receiving psychoeducation and treatment at distance from
   an impersonal website. Such ethical issues need to be recognized and
   proactively managed in website and study design as well as treatment
   implementation. In order for online interventions to succeed, risks and
   expectations of all involved need to be carefully considered with a
   focus on ethical integrity.},

Abstract = {Credential-guessing attacks often exploit passwords that were reused
   across a user's online accounts. To learn how organizations can better
   protect users, we retrospectively analyzed our university's
   vulnerability to credential-guessing attacks across twenty years. Given
   a list of university usernames, we searched for matches in both data
   breaches from hundreds of websites and a dozen large compilations of
   breaches. After cracking hashed passwords and tweaking guesses, we
   successfully guessed passwords for 32.0\% of accounts matched to a
   university email address in a data breach, as well as 6.5\% of accounts
   where the username (but not necessarily the domain) matched. Many of
   these accounts remained vulnerable for years after the breached data was
   leaked, and passwords found verbatim in breaches were nearly four times
   as likely to have been exploited (i.e., suspicious account activity was
   observed) than tweaked guesses. Over 70 different data breaches and
   various username-matching strategies bootstrapped correct guesses. In
   surveys of 40 users whose passwords we guessed, many users were unaware
   of the risks to their university account or that their credentials had
   been breached. This analysis of password reuse at our university
   provides pragmatic advice for organizations to protect accounts.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Volume = {9},
Pages = {146810-146821},
Abstract = {Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks are increasing as the
   demand for Internet connectivity massively grows in recent years.
   Conventional shallow machine learning-based techniques for DDoS attack
   classification tend to be ineffective when the volume and features of
   network traffic, potentially carry malicious DDoS payloads, increase
   exponentially as they cannot extract high importance features
   automatically. To address this concern, we propose a hybrid approach
   named AE-MLP that combines two deep learning-based models for effective
   DDoS attack detection and classification. The Autoencoder (AE) part of
   our proposed model provides an effective feature extraction that finds
   the most relevant feature sets automatically without human intervention
   (e.g., knowledge of cybersecurity professionals). The Multi-layer
   Perceptron Network (MLP) part of our proposed model uses the compressed
   and reduced feature sets produced by the AE as inputs and classifies the
   attacks into different DDoS attack types to overcome the performance
   overhead and bias associated with processing large feature sets with
   noise (i.e., unnecessary feature values). Our experimental results,
   obtained through comprehensive and extensive experiments on different
   aspects of performance on the CICDDoS2019 dataset, demonstrate both a
   very high and robust accuracy rate and F1-score that exceed 98\% which
   also outperformed the performance of many similar methods. This shows
   that our proposed model can be used as an effective DDoS defense tool
   against the growing number of DDoS attacks.},

Abstract = {We use authentication services many times a day. Without user
   authentication, it would be impossible to use email accounts, discussion
   boards, e-banking or even electronic communication. On the other hand,
   we release a lot of personal information during every authentication
   process. Our login can be linked to used services and assets by service
   providers. The frequency of usage and therefore the map of our behaviour
   on the Internet can be created to make more focused advertisement, to
   track us or even to steal our electronic identity. The goal of this
   paper is to state the requirements and provide the initial design for an
   anonymous authentication scheme which prevents the leakage of private
   information. The new scheme, to be widely acceptable, must be beneficial
   for both users and service providers, who implement the authentication
   systems. Therefore we claim that the new authentication system must
   provide a feature for revealing dishonest users. These users can be
   eventually deanonymized and charged for damages. We provide such a
   responsibility-protecting feature in our scheme. We also compare our
   scheme design with current anonymous authentication schemes and provide
   initial performance results from our smart-card implementation.},

Abstract = {Online Social Networks (OSNs) are the most popular web services
   nowadays. They provide users with different kinds of services. Anyone
   can create his account on a certain OSN such as Facebook, using an email
   and password for registration. In addition, a single user can own one or
   more accounts. However, this feature has a lot of disadvantages and
   security drawbacks, such as creating fake accounts. A fake account is a
   profile that exists physically on OSN. Nonetheless, it is missing
   identity information such as names, last name, profile photo, and other
   profile attributes. Owners of fake accounts exploit them (accounts) for
   malicious internet activities like phishing, hacking, and more.
   Recently, this problem attracted considerably the research community. In
   this context, a lot of approaches have been emerged to solve fake
   account detection on OSNs. However, despite its importance, this field
   of research is still missing a systematic review. In this paper, we
   introduce a survey on sixteen kinds of research studies that have
   proposed solutions for solving the detection of fake accounts problem.
   We analyzed the following themes: Social networking platforms,
   evaluation metrics, machine learning algorithms, and models, data scale,
   features, and result accuracy were studied and analyzed in this survey.},

Abstract = {In recent times, a phishing attack has become one of the most prominent
   attacks faced by internet users, governments, and service-providing
   organizations. In a phishing attack, the attacker(s) collects the
   client's sensitive data (i.e., user account login details, credit/debit
   card numbers, etc.) by using spoofed emails or fake websites. Phishing
   websites are common entry points of online social engineering attacks,
   including numerous frauds on the websites. In such types of attacks, the
   attacker(s) create website pages by copying the behavior of legitimate
   websites and sends URL(s) to the targeted victims through spam messages,
   texts, or social networking. To provide a thorough understanding of
   phishing attack(s), this paper provides a literature review of
   Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques: Machine Learning, Deep
   Learning, Hybrid Learning, and Scenario-based techniques for phishing
   attack detection. This paper also presents the comparison of different
   studies detecting the phishing attack for each AI technique and examines
   the qualities and shortcomings of these methodologies. Furthermore, this
   paper provides a comprehensive set of current challenges of phishing
   attacks and future research direction in this domain.},

Abstract = {Consider the following problem: Alice wishes to maintain her email using
   a storage-provider Bob (such as a Yahoo! or hotmail e-mail account).
   This storage-provider should provide for Alice the ability to collect,
   retrieve, search and delete emails but, at the same time, should learn
   neither the content of messages sent from the senders to Alice (with Bob
   as an intermediary), nor the search criteria used by Alice. A trivial
   solution is that messages will be sent to Bob in encrypted form and
   Alice, whenever she wants to search for some message, will ask Bob to
   send her a copy of the entire database of encrypted emails. This however
   is highly inefficient. We will be interested in solutions that are
   communication-efficient and, at the same time, respect the privacy of
   Alice. In this paper, we show how to create a public-key encryption
   scheme for Alice that allows PIR searching over encrypted documents. Our
   solution is the first to reveal no partial information regarding the
   user's search (including the access pattern) in the public-key setting
   and with non-trivially small communication complexity. This provides a
   theoretical solution to a problem posed by Boneh, DiCrescenzo, Ostrovsky
   and Persiano on ``Public-key Encryption with Keyword Search.{''} The
   main technique of our solution also allows for Single-Database PIR
   writing with sub-linear communication complexity, which we consider of
   independent interest.},

Title = {Online medical education using a Facebook peer-to-peer learning platform
   during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study exploring learner and
   tutor acceptability of Facebook as a learning platform},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},

Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {BackgroundIn recent years, higher education institutions have been
   moving teaching online, accelerated by the pandemic. The Remote Learning
   Project (RLP), based at the Norwich Medical School (NMS) in the United
   Kingdom (U.K.), was a peer-to-peer teaching program developed to
   supplement medical school teaching during the pandemic. The teaching was
   delivered through Facebook using peer-to-peer teaching. Tutors were
   final year medical students, teaching medical student learners in lower
   years. Tutors and learners perception of peer-to-peer online learning
   delivered through the Facebook Social Media (SoMe) platform was
   investigated.MethodsThis qualitative study recruited tutor and learner
   participants from NMS by email, participation in the study was
   voluntary. Online semi-structured interviews of both tutors and learners
   in the remote learning project were conducted. The data was analysed
   using thematic analysis.ResultsSeven participants were interviewed. Five
   themes were identified; education (learning/teaching), productivity,
   data security, professionalism, and usability of the platform. Learners
   enjoyed the asynchronous nature of the platform and both learners and
   tutors enjoyed the peer-to-peer nature of the RLP, including the ability
   to immediately and easily answer on Facebook comments. Some learners
   felt distracted on Facebook, whilst others enjoyed the reminders. The
   mix of social and professional on the platform was met with caution from
   tutors. Both learners and tutors enjoyed the familiarity of the
   platform.ConclusionsThe study found that SoMe may be a credible platform
   to deliver online peer-to-peer teaching. Educators should consider the
   ergonomics of SoMe platforms when designing online curriculums.
   Guidelines for educators should be developed to better guide educators
   on the effective and safe use of SoMe as a learning tool.},

Title = {Measuring Caloric Intake at the Population Level (NOTION): Protocol for
   an Experimental Study},
Journal = {JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: The monitoring of caloric intake is an important challenge
   for the maintenance of individual and public health. The instruments
   used so far for dietary monitoring (eg, food frequency questionnaires,
   food diaries, and telephone interviews) are inexpensive and easy to
   implement but show important inaccuracies. Alternative methods based on
   wearable devices and wrist accelerometers have been proposed, yet they
   have limited accuracy in predicting caloric intake because analytics are
   usually not well suited to manage the massive sets of data generated
   from these types of devices.
   Objective: This study aims to develop an algorithm using recent advances
   in machine learning methodology, which provides a precise and stable
   estimate of caloric intake.
   Methods: The study will capture four individual eating activities
   outside the home over 2 months. Twenty healthy Italian adults will be
   recruited from the University of Padova in Padova, Italy, with email,
   flyers, and website announcements. The eligibility requirements include
   age 18 to 66 years and no eating disorder history. Each participant will
   be randomized to one of two menus to be eaten on weekdays in a
   predefined cafeteria in Padova (northeastern Italy). Flows of raw data
   will be accessed and downloaded from the wearable devices given to study
   participants and associated with anthropometric and demographic
   characteristics of the user (with their written permission). These
   massive data flows will provide a detailed picture of real-life
   conditions and will be analyzed through an up-to-date machine learning
   approach with the aim to accurately predict the caloric contribution of
   individual eating activities. Gold standard evaluation of the energy
   content of eaten foods will be obtained using calorimetric assessments
   made at the Laboratory of Dietetics and Nutraceutical Research of the
   University of Padova.
   Results: The study will last 14 months from July 2017 with a final
   report by November 2018. Data collection will occur from October to
   December 2017. From this study, we expect to obtain a series of relevant
   data that, opportunely filtered, could allow the construction of a
   prototype algorithm able to estimate caloric intake through the
   recognition of food type and the number of bites. The algorithm should
   work in real time, be embedded in a wearable device, and able to match
   bite-related movements and the corresponding caloric intake with high
   accuracy.
   Conclusions: Building an automatic calculation method for caloric
   intake, independent on the black-box processing of the wearable devices
   marketed so far, has great potential both for clinical nutrition (eg,
   for assessing cardiovascular compliance or for the prevention of
   coronary heart disease through proper dietary control) and public health
   nutrition as a low-cost monitoring tool for eating habits of different
   segments of the population.},

Abstract = {Currently, licensed seasonal influenza vaccines display variable vaccine
   effectiveness, and there remains a need for novel vaccine platforms
   capable of inducing broader responses against viral protein domains
   conserved among influenza subtypes. We conducted a first-in-human,
   randomized, open-label, phase 1 clinical trial (NCT03186781) to evaluate
   a novel ferritin (H2HA-Ferritin) nanoparticle influenza vaccine
   platform. The H2 subtype has not circulated in humans since 1968. Adults
   born after 1968 have been exposed to only the H1 subtype of group 1
   influenza viruses, which shares a conserved stem with H2. Including both
   H2-naive and H2-exposed adults in the trial allowed us to evaluate
   memory responses against the conserved stem domain in the presence or
   absence of pre-existing responses against the immunodominant HA head
   domain. Fifty healthy participants 18-70 years of age received
   H2HA-Ferritin intramuscularly as a single 20-mu g dose (n = 5) or a
   60-mu g dose either twice in a homologous (n = 25) prime-boost regimen
   or once in a heterologous (n = 20) prime-boost regimen after a matched
   H2 DNA vaccine prime. The primary objective of this trial was to
   evaluate the safety and tolerability of H2HA-Ferritin either alone or in
   prime-boost regimens. The secondary objective was to evaluate antibody
   responses after vaccination. Both vaccines were safe and well tolerated,
   with the most common solicited symptom being mild headache after both
   H2HA-Ferritin (n = 15, 22\%) and H2 DNA (n = 5, 25\%). Exploratory
   analyses identified neutralizing antibody responses elicited by the
   H2HA-Ferritin vaccine in both H2-naive and H2-exposed populations.
   Furthermore, broadly neutralizing antibody responses against group 1
   influenza viruses, including both seasonal H1 and avian H5 subtypes,
   were induced in the H2-naive population through targeting the HA stem.
   This ferritin nanoparticle vaccine technology represents a novel, safe
   and immunogenic platform with potential application for pandemic
   preparedness and universal influenza vaccine development.},

Abstract = {Dog aggression directed towards humans is a common and serious
   behavioral and public health issue. This cross-sectional study was
   designed to gain insights into U.S. small animal veterinarians' views
   and experiences with the most common dog breeds in the U.S., dog
   aggression, and breed-specific legislation. An electronic survey was
   distributed via email to an online veterinary community, and responses
   were summarized and compared by means of chi(2) and
   Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests. Most respondents were concerned about the
   risks of dog bite injuries, but the majority were not in favor of
   banning specific breeds of dogs in order to enhance public safety. When
   participants rated the perceived bite risk associated with popular dog
   breeds, Chow Chows were perceived as the highest risk, with pit bull
   types categorized as a moderate risk. Golden Retrievers were seen as the
   most appropriate for families with children. Public education about
   animal behavior was the most frequently endorsed policy intervention to
   increase public safety. These findings suggest that most veterinarians
   feel that banning an entire dog breed is not an effective way to ensure
   human safety. Instead, most respondents endorsed alternative
   initiatives, such as public education and stricter leash laws, to reduce
   the risk of dog bites.},

Title = {Federated Graph Neural Network for Fast Anomaly Detection in Controller
   Area Networks},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Pages = {1566-1579},
Abstract = {Due to the lack of CAN frame encryption and authentication, CAN bus is
   vulnerable to various attacks, which can in general be divided into
   message injection, suspension, and falsification. Existing CAN bus
   anomaly detection mechanisms either can only detect one or two of these
   attacks, or require numerous CAN messages during predictions, which can
   hardly realize real-time performance. In this paper, we propose a CAN
   bus anomaly detection system that can detect all these attacks
   simultaneously in as short as 3 milliseconds (ms) based on Graph Neural
   Network (GNN). This work generates directed attributed graphs based on
   CAN message streams in given message intervals. Node attributes denote
   data contents in CAN messages while each edge attribute represents the
   frequency of a typical CAN ID pair in the given interval. Afterwards, a
   GNN is trained based on generated CAN message graphs. Considering highly
   imbalanced training data, a two-stage classifier cascade is developed in
   this paper, which is composed of a one-class classifier for anomaly
   detection and a multi-class classifier for attack classification. An
   openmax layer is further introduced to the multi-class classifier to
   tackle new anomalies from unknown classes. To take advantage of
   crowdsourcing while protecting user data privacy, we adopt federated
   learning to train a universal model that covers different driving
   scenarios and vehicle states. Extensive experiment results show the
   effectiveness and efficiency of our methodology.},

Title = {An Empirical Approach to Phishing Countermeasures Through Smart Glasses
   and Validation Agents},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {130758-130771},
Abstract = {Phishing attacks have been persistent for more than two decades despite
   mitigation efforts from academia and industry. We believe that users
   fall victim to attacks not only because of lack of knowledge and
   awareness, but also because they are not attentive enough to security
   indicators and visual abnormalities on the webpages they visit. This is
   also probably why smart device users, who have more limited screen size
   and device capabilities compared to desktop users, are three times more
   likely to fall victim to phishing attacks. To assert our claim, we first
   investigated general phishing awareness among different groups of
   smartphone users. We then used smart eyeglasses (electro-oculographic)
   to experimentally measure the mental effort and vigilance exhibited by
   users while surfing a website and while playing an Android phishing game
   that we developed. The results showed that knowledge and awareness about
   phishing do not seem to have a significant impact on security
   behaviours, as knowledgeable participants exhibited insecure behaviours
   such as opening email attachments from unfamiliar senders. However,
   attentiveness was important as even participants with low cybersecurity
   knowledge could effectively identify attacks if they were reasonably
   attentive. Based on these results, we asserted that users are more
   likely to continue falling victim to phishing attacks due to insecure
   behaviours, unless tools to lessen the identification burden are
   provided. We thus recommended implementing a lightweight algorithm into
   a custom Android browser for detecting phishing sites deceptively
   without a user interaction. We used fake login credentials as validation
   agents and monitor the destination server HTTP responses to determine
   the authenticity of a webpage. We also presented initial evaluation
   results of this algorithm.},

Abstract = {Purpose: University students may be at risk for food insecurity (Fl) due
   to low income coupled with rising tuition, housing, and food costs. This
   study aimed to determine the prevalence of Fl and potential correlates
   among students at a small, rural Canadian university.
   Methods: Health Canada's 10-item household food security survey module
   (HFSSM) was adapted to assess food security status within the
   postsecondary student population. An additional 11 items measured food
   access and demographics. The validated, web-based survey was distributed
   by email and completed by 218 students (15.6\% response rate).
   Participants were classified as food secure, moderately food insecure,
   or severely food insecure using the HFSSM Adult scale.
   Results: An overall Fl rate of 37.2\% was observed. This included 25.7\%
   moderately food insecure and 11.5\% severely food insecure. Students in
   higher years of study and who lived off campus had higher rates of Fl.
   Conclusions: Fl appears to be a significant concern for university
   students and has potential health and academic implications. Further
   research is needed to clarify the determinants and extent of Fl for
   postsecondary students and to develop strategies to mitigate the
   prevalence and effects of food insecurity in these young adults.},

Abstract = {Crimes in the cyberspace are increasing day by day. Recent cyber threat
   defense reports states that 80.7\% of the systems are compromised at
   least once in 2020. Cyber criminals taking the pandemic situation as an
   opportunity for the mass attack through malicious URL circulated by
   email or text messages in social media. Performing cyber-attacks through
   malicious URLs is the handy method for the cyber criminals. Protecting
   from such attacks requires proper awareness and solid defense system.
   Some of the common approaches followed by the cybercriminals to deceive
   the victims are 1. Phishing URLs which is very similar to the legitimate
   URLs. 2. Redirecting URLs 3. Using JavaScript, redirects to the phishing
   URL when user interacts with webpage 4. Social engineering etc. As soon
   as the novice internet users clicks on the malicious URL link, cyber
   criminals can easily steal personal information or install malware on
   their device to get additional access. Recently malicious URLs are
   generated algorithmically and uses URL shortening service to evade the
   existing security setup such as firewall and web filters. In literature,
   the researchers have proposed several ways to detect the malicious URLs
   but, new attack vectors that are introduced by the cyber criminals can
   easily bypass the security system. The purpose of this paper is to
   provide an overview of various malicious URL detection techniques which
   includes blacklist based, rules based, machine learning and deep
   learning-based techniques. Most importantly, the paper discusses the
   common features used by the detection system from webpages to classify
   the URL as malicious or benign and various performance metrics. This
   will encourage the new researchers to bring out the innovative
   solutions.},

   Technology and Innovation (KTI), is based on the results and experiences
   of many years of the Medical Online Consultation Service at the
   University Hospital Zurich. The focus is on development and provision of
   a comprehensive, telemedicine service. Citizens and patients should be
   provided more safety at home and the family doctor should be supported
   by the service. Core elements of the project include the telemonitoring
   of vital signs combined with an individual teleconsultation via
   telephone, email and video. Technically, the service is supported by a
   web-based documentation and communication platform with an integrated
   patient record. In a one-year planning phase, individual interviews and
   group discussions were conducted with the participants of the study. The
   results are continuously incorporated into the concept. The subsequent
   pilot phase analyzed the developed telemedical approach and leads to
   further improvements. The aim of the study is the evaluation of the
   needs, feasibility and acceptance of telemedicine services from the
   perspective of the user, taking into account their social environment.},

   features such as fall detection, emergency messaging via hand gestures,
   and vital signs monitoring, including oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) and
   heart rate. The smart glove integrates the MPU6050 and MAX30100 sensors
   with Arduino and ESP8266 modules to achieve these functionalities. Fall
   detection is accurately identified by the MPU6050 sensor, while the
   MAX30100 sensor monitors SpO(2) and heart rate. Hand gestures are
   recognized and interpreted for sending emergency messages. Data from
   these sensors are transmitted through IFTTT, enabling alerts and
   notifications via SMS, email, and a secured website, thus facilitating
   real-time remote monitoring and communication. This setup provides a
   comprehensive and reliable method for monitoring the health and safety
   of elderly individuals, ensuring prompt response and care in
   emergencies. The proposed system demonstrates significant potential in
   enhancing the quality of life for elderly individuals by offering a
   smart, integrated, and user-friendly healthcare solution.},

Title = {Effect of a Nutrition Intervention on Mediterranean Diet Adherence Among
   Firefighters A Cluster Randomized Clinical Trial},
Journal = {JAMA NETWORK OPEN},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},

Abstract = {IMPORTANCE US firefighters are a working population at risk of chronic
   diseases, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. This
   risk may be mitigated by a healthy diet.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of a Mediterranean nutrition
   intervention using a behavioral/ environmental approach
   (firefighter/fire station/home) at the individual participant level.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This 12-month cluster randomized
   clinical trial included US career firefighters from fire stations and
   homes within 2 Indiana fire departments. Participants were randomized by
   fire station to either Mediterranean diet or control (usual care). The
   study was conducted from October 2016 to December 2019, and data were
   analyzed in November 2022.
   INTERVENTION For the first 12 months of the study, firefighters located
   at fire stations randomized to the intervention group were provided with
   access to supermarket discounts and free samples of Mediterranean diet
   foods, online nutrition education platforms, email announcements and
   reminders, family and peer education and support, and chef
   demonstrations. Firefighters in fire stations allocated to the control
   group received no intervention and were instructed to follow their usual
   diet.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Change in dietary habits at 12 months as
   measured by a modified Mediterranean diet score (range, 0 to 51 points)
   at baseline and 6-month and 12-month follow-up. Cardiometabolic
   parameters were secondary outcomes.
   RESULTS Of 485 included firefighters, 458 (94.4\%) were male, and the
   mean (SD) age was 47 (7.5) years. A total of 241 firefighters (27 fire
   stations) were randomized to the Mediterranean nutrition intervention,
   and 244 (25 fire stations) were randomized to usual diet. Outcomes were
   analyzed using generalized linear mixed models for modified
   Mediterranean diet score at 6 months (n = 336) and 12 months (n = 260),
   adjusting for baseline age, sex, race and ethnicity, fire department,
   physical activity, and waist circumference. In the intervention group
   compared with the control group, the modified Mediterranean diet score
   significantly increased by 2.01 points (95\% CI, 0.62-3.40; P = .005) at
   6 months and by 2.67 points (95\% CI, 1.14-4.20; P = .001) at 12 months.
   Among secondary outcomes, changes in cardiometabolic risk factors were
   not statistically significant at 1 year. Results from analyses with
   multilevel multiple imputation for missingness were similar.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this Mediterranean nutrition intervention
   of multicomponent behavioral/environmental changes, career firefighters
   had increased adherence to a Mediterranean diet.},

Abstract = {High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) surgery is a promising
   technology for the treatment of several pathologies, including cancer.
   Testing is a fundamental step for verifying treatment efficacy and
   safety. Ex-vivo tissues represent the most common solution for
   replicating the properties of human tissues in the HIFU operative
   scenario. However, they constitute an avoidable waste of resources.
   Thus, tissue mimicking phantoms have been investigated as a more
   sustainable and reliable alternative. In this scenario, we proposed a
   reusable silicone-based thermochromic phantom. It is cost-effective and
   can be rapidly fabricated. The acoustic, mechanical, and thermal
   characterization of the phantom are reported. The phantom usability was
   evaluated with a HIFU robotic platform. 18 different working conditions
   were tested by varying both sonication power and duration. Temperature
   and simulated lesions' size were quantified for all testing conditions.
   An accordance between temperature and lesion dimension trend over time
   was found. The proposed phantom results a valid alternative to ex-vivo
   tissues, especially in the early stages of developing novel HIFU
   treatment paradigms.},

Abstract = {As Grids become increasingly relied upon as critical infrastructure, it
   is imperative to ensure the highly-available and secure day-to-day
   operation of the Grid infrastructure. The current approach for Grid
   management is generally to have geographically-distributed system
   administrators contact each other by phone or email to debug Grid
   behavior and subsequently modify or reconfigure the deployed Grid
   software. For security-related events such as the required patching of
   vulnerable Grid software, this ad hoc process can take too much time, is
   error-prone and tedious, and thus is unlikely to completely solve the
   problems. In this paper, we present the application of the ANDREA
   management system to control Grid service functionality in
   near-real-time at scales of thousands of services with minimal human
   involvement. We show how ANDREA can be used to better ensure the
   security of the Grid: In experiments using 11,394 Globus Toolkit v4
   deployments we show the performance of ANDREA for three
   increasingly-sophisticated reactions to an intruder detection: shutting
   down the entire Grid; incrementally eliminating Grid service for
   different classes of users; and issuing and applying a patch to the
   vulnerability exploited by the attacker. We believe that this work is an
   important first step toward automating the general day-to-day monitoring
   and reconfiguration of all aspects of Grid deployments.},

Title = {ROSec: Intra-Process Isolation for ROS Composition With Memory
   Protection Keys},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {22},
Pages = {10546-10559},
Abstract = {Robot Operating System (ROS) is a software framework for robotic systems
   that includes various packages for developing robotic applications.
   Composition is a package that combines multiple applications, namely,
   nodes, to be loaded and executed in a single process. However,
   permitting multiple nodes to share the address space could expand the
   attack surface such that vulnerabilities in a node are more likely to be
   exploited to subvert nodes running in the same space. We propose ROSec,
   an in-process isolation solution for ROS composition that utilizes Intel
   Memory Protection Keys. ROSecaims to enforce memory isolation between
   nodes within a process by preventing unauthorized access from one node
   to another. Unlike previous works that assume the number and sizes of
   nodes are statically defined and partitioned by developers, ROSecis
   designed to handle the dynamic nature of nodes that can be loaded and
   executed in a process at any time during execution. To achieve this,
   ROSecadopts a unique scheduling mechanism that utilizes the
   executor-centric execution model of ROS to perform two main operations
   for MPK-based isolation: protection key assignment and reassignment. Our
   evaluation shows that ROSeceffectively enforces in-process isolation
   while incurring a 6.4\% performance overhead on a real-world
   application. Note to Practitioners-Cyber-Physical Systems are the core
   of modern applications, particularly robotics, as they integrate
   computing and physical processes. ROS necessitates real-time and
   security guarantees, which, unfortunately, trade-off with each other.
   While traditional ROS architecture relies on process isolation to
   separate various nodes, ROS2 introduces a feature called composition,
   which allows multiple nodes to run inside a single process, thus
   exposing various nodes to potential malicious compromises from others.
   This paper proposes a technique that utilizes Intel memory protection
   keys (MPK) to provide intraprocess isolation for ROS composition. Given
   that ROS nodes are dynamic, ROSEC provides key assignment and
   reassignment techniques to configure MPK dynamically.},

Abstract = {Phishing is a widespread practice and a lucrative business. It is
   invasive and hard to stop: a company needs to worry about all emails
   that all employees receive, while an attacker only needs to have a
   response from a key person, e.g., a finance or human resources'
   responsible, to cause a lot of damage. Some research has looked into
   what elements make phishing so successful. Many of these elements recall
   strategies that have been studied as principles of persuasion, scams and
   social engineering. This paper identifies, from the literature, the
   elements which reflect the effectiveness of phishing, and manually
   quantifies them within a phishing email sample. Most elements recognised
   as more effective in phishing commonly use persuasion principles such as
   authority and distraction. This insight could lead to better automate
   the identification of phishing emails and devise more appropriate
   countermeasures against them.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors for
   work-related respiratory conditions (asthma, farmer's lung, sinusitis,
   rhinitis, and environmental allergies, diagnosed by a physician) among
   farm and ranch operators in the central US. A survey was conducted by
   the Central States Center for Agricultural Safety and Health (CS-CASH)
   in 2018, focusing on work-related injuries, illnesses, exposures, and
   preventive measures in a seven-state region (Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota,
   Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota). Farms and ranches
   (n = 16,818) with an email address and annual sales exceeding \$5,000
   were randomly selected for the survey. Agricultural production and
   weather data were merged with survey responses. The relationship between
   exposures and respiratory conditions was analyzed using generalized
   estimating equations. We received responses from 3,268 agricultural
   operations (19\% response rate) containing information on 4,064
   individual operators. The life-time prevalence of (any) respiratory
   conditions among farm/ranch operators was 18\%. Risk factors for
   respiratory conditions included exposures to grain/hay/feed dust (OR
   2.41), animal confinement dust (OR 1.57), field/road dust (OR 2.11),
   manure/silage gasses (OR 1.66), anhydrous ammonia (OR 1.51),
   fuels/solvents/paints (OR 1.92), older age group >70 vs. <43 (OR 1.40),
   female gender (OR 1.82), and being primary vs. third operator (OR 1.61).
   Farmers and ranchers have a high prevalence of respiratory conditions
   associated with dust and gas exposures at work. More effective
   protective measures are needed using the hierarchy of controls,
   including improved use of respiratory protection.},

Abstract = {The presence of unsolicited bulk emails, commonly known as spam, can
   seriously compromise normal user activities, forcing them to navigate
   through mailboxes to find the - relatively few - interesting emails.
   Even if a quite huge variety of spam filters has been developed until
   now, this problem is far to be resolved since spammers continuously
   modify their malicious techniques in order to bypass filters. In
   particular, in the last years spammers have begun vehiculating
   unsolicited commercial messages by means of images attached to emails
   whose textual part appears perfectly legitimate.
   In this paper we present a method for overcoming some of the problems
   that still remain with state-of-the-art spam filters when checking
   images attached to emails. Results on both personal and publicly
   available email databases are presented, in order to assess the
   performance of the proposed approach.},

Title = {Electronic Consultation in Primary Care Between Providers and Patients:
   Systematic Review},

Volume = {7},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Background: Governments and health care providers are keen to find
   innovative ways to deliver care more efficiently. Interest in electronic
   consultation (e-consultation) has grown, but the evidence of benefit is
   uncertain.
   Objective: This study aimed to assess the evidence of delivering
   e-consultation using secure email and messaging or video links in
   primary care.
   Methods: A systematic review was conducted on the use and application of
   e-consultations in primary care. We searched 7 international databases
   (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, EconLit, and Web
   of Science; 1999-2017), identifying 52 relevant studies. Papers were
   screened against a detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria.
   Independent dual data extraction was conducted and assessed for quality.
   The resulting evidence was synthesized using thematic analysis.
   Results: This review included 57 studies from a range of countries,
   mainly the United States (n=30) and the United Kingdom (n=13). There
   were disparities in uptake and utilization toward more use by younger,
   employed adults. Patient responses to e-consultation were mixed.
   Patients reported satisfaction with services and improved self-care,
   communication, and engagement with clinicians. Evidence for the
   acceptability and ease of use was strong, especially for those with
   long-term conditions and patients located in remote regions. However,
   patients were concerned about the privacy and security of their data.
   For primary health care staff, e-consultation delivers challenges around
   time management, having the correct technological infrastructure,
   whether it offers a comparable standard of clinical quality, and whether
   it improves health outcomes.
   Conclusions: E-consultations may improve aspects of care delivery, but
   the small scale of many of the studies and low adoption rates leave
   unanswered questions about usage, quality, cost, and sustainability. We
   need to improve e-consultation implementation, demonstrate how
   e-consultations will not increase disparities in access, provide better
   reassurance to patients about privacy, and incorporate e-consultation as
   part of a manageable clinical workflow.},

Abstract = {High-performance vision-based decision-making networks are often limited
   by hardware capabilities in practical applications. To address this
   challenge, this study proposes lightweight optimization strategies for
   decision-making models from the aspects of parameter size, training
   memory usage, and inference speed. Specifically, an innovative solution
   is proposed to achieve lightweight parameters. The Video Swin
   Transformer is employed to simultaneously extract temporal and spatial
   features, with the network trained using a Prioritized Replay Deep
   Q-Network (PRDQN) that incorporates risk assessment. To further reduce
   training memory usage, the Q-target network in PRDQN is removed, and the
   mellowmax operator is integrated to enhance the training process,
   resulting in the PRDeepMellow Swin Transformer. After analyzing the
   inference speed problems encountered by the algorithm in practical
   applications, the vanilla self-attention is replaced by a linear
   self-attention based on double softmax, namely Double Softmax Linear
   Video Swin Transformer (DSLVS Transformer) which improves the inference
   speed for long sequences. The proposed methods were evaluated across
   three high-speed lane change scenarios (a static scenario, a dynamic
   scenario, and a randomly changing scenario). Experimental results
   demonstrate that the proposed methods can still maintain excellent
   decision performance after the corresponding lightweight optimizations.},

Abstract = {While most are aware of news stories related to individuals
   ``hacking{''} into government agencies, credit bureaus, and businesses,
   the subject of the vulnerability of on-line education to cyber-attack is
   rarely discussed. However, there are nearly seven million online
   students in the United States alone, and they are all potential targets.
   Online education systems are ``soft targets{''} because education
   systems tend to lag in both technology and trained personnel. The
   consequences can be significant, with security breaches of university
   systems resulting in costs to universities in millions of dollars. The
   purpose of this study was to discern cyber threats and the most likely
   areas of vulnerability of cyber attack of online learning systems. The
   methodology was an e-Delphi study using an expert panel. The design is a
   classical Delphi technique, but conducted via email (e-Delphi).
   Selection of an expert panel is critical and the panel members are all
   involved with both cyber-security and higher education at some level.
   All are active in national and international discussions on the topic of
   cyber threats to educational systems. The e-Delphi technique used the
   traditional three rounds of questions and responses. A series of seven
   topics emerged from the second round, including vulnerability of data,
   the need for improved use authentication, outdated hardware and
   software, encryption, leader concerns, and training for staff and
   students. The third round asked the expert panel to expand on the most
   critical issues, which included vulnerability of data, user
   authentication, and outdated hardware and software. The panel was then
   asked three additional questions about each of the three most critical
   issues and multiple subthemes developed. The subthemes are detailed,
   summarized, and discussed. The findings of the study highlight the
   seriousness of this issue and provide topics that need to be addressed
   as well as leading-edge methods to address cyber security threats to
   online learning systems.},

Abstract = {Introduction. - In 2016, 22.0\% of deliveries in France were induced.
   The current lack of high level of evidence data about the methods and
   indications for induction of labour has promoted heterogeneous and
   non-recommended practices. The extent of these different practices is
   not adequately known in France today, although they may influence
   perinatal outcomes. The objective of this study was to report current
   practices of induction of labour in France.
   Material and methods. - This study surveyed 94 maternity units in seven
   perinatal networks. A questionnaire was sent by email to either the
   department head or delivery room supervisor of these units to ask about
   their methods for induction and their attitudes in specific obstetric
   situations.
   Results. - The rate of induction varied between maternity units from
   7.7\% to 33\% of deliveries. Most units used two (39.4\%) or three or
   more (35.1\%) agents for cervical ripening. In all, 87 (92.6\%) units
   reported using dinoprostone as a vaginal slow-released insert, 59 units
   dinosprostone as a vaginal gel (62.8\%) and 46 units a balloon catheter
   (48.9\%). Only three units reported using vaginal misoprostol.
   Inductions without medical indication were reported by 71 (75.5\%)
   maternity units, and 22 (23.4\%) units even when the cervix was
   unfavourable. Obstetric attitudes in cases of breech presentation,
   previous caesareans, fetal growth restriction or macrosomia and
   prelabour rupture of the membranes varied widely.
   Discussion. - The variability of practices for induction of labour and
   the persistence of disapproved practices call for an assessment of the
   effectiveness and the safety of the different strategies. (C) 2017

Title = {The Curated Food System: A Limiting Aspirational Vision of What
   Constitutes ``Good{''} Food},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {17},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In an effort to elucidate an aspirational vision for the food system and
   explore whether the characteristics of such a system inadvertently set
   unattainable standards for low-wealth rural communities, we applied
   discourse analysis to the following qualitative datasets: (1) interviews
   with food experts and advocates, (2) scholarly and grey literature, (3)
   industry websites, and (4) email exchanges between food advocates. The
   analysis revealed eight aspirational food system discourses: production,
   distribution, and infrastructure; healthy, organic, local food;
   behavioral health and education; sustainability; finance and investment;
   hunger relief; demand-side preferences; romanticized, community led
   transformations. Study findings reveal that of eight discourses, only
   three encompass the experiences of low-wealth rural residents. This
   aspirational food system may aggravate the lack of autonomy and
   powerlessness already experienced by low-wealth rural groups, perpetuate
   a sense of failure by groups who will be unable to reach the
   aspirational food vision, silence discourses that might question those
   that play a role in the inequitable distribution of income while
   sanctioning discourses that focus on personal or community solutions,
   and leave out other policy-based solutions that address issues located
   within the food system. Further research might explore how to draw
   attention to silenced discourses on the needs and preferences of
   low-wealth rural populations to ensure that the policies and programs
   promoted by food system experts mitigate poor diets caused by food
   insecurity. Further research is needed to inform policies and programs
   to mitigate food insecurity in low-wealth rural populations.},

Title = {Decision-making around psychotropic medications for children in foster
   care: Perspectives from foster parents},
Journal = {CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {70},
Pages = {206-213},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background and objective: Children infoster care have complex mental
   health needs and receive high rates of psychotropic medications. Rarely
   can foster parents make legal decisions about treatment, yet they are
   intricately involved in the child's life and responsible for the child's
   safety and well-being. We aimed to conduct the first study of foster
   parent perspectives on decision-making relevant to the use of
   psychotropics with children in foster care.
   Methods: We conducted semi-structured phone interviews with 13 parents
   in a small northeastern state who had fostered a child receiving
   psychotropics in the past 5 years. The state child welfare agency sent
   information about the study via email to all foster and adoptive parents
   for whom they had email contact. Interviews queried parents' knowledge
   and attitudes toward psychotropics, engagement in decisions, and
   recommendations for the decision-making process. Interview responses
   were coded and synthesized using mixed inductive and deductive methods
   in Dedoose software.
   Results: Children came into care on an average of four psychotropics.
   Parents reported receiving little information about the medications and
   finding information on their own. Parents acknowledged the potential
   benefits of meditations, yet attitudes were largely against their use.
   Internal and external pressures for and against the use of medications
   were described. Many parents felt left out of the decisions and
   recommended team decisions.
   Conclusions: Efforts to improve foster parents' knowledge of
   medications, side effects, and monitoring, as well as team decision
   protocols, are sorely needed to,improve decisions for this population.

Title = {Smishing Strategy Dynamics and Evolving Botnet Activities in Japan},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {114869-114884},
Abstract = {XLoader and FakeSpy, the two major smishing botnets targeting Japan,
   change their attack strategies over various timescales. Based on recent
   observations of the botnets and Twitter data, we present empirical facts
   about their strategies and activity patterns and applied some of these
   strategic and activity patterns to malware detection and malicious
   domain detection. All the proposed methods yielded small false positive
   and negative rates, and are expected to run on user devices owing to
   their small computational cost. Recent malware detection methods based
   on traffic analysis extract TCP/IP traffic features if the upper layers
   of TCP are encrypted. In this study, Frida's hooking capability was
   employed to decode the upper layers (WebSocket and JSON-RPC) to create a
   list of all commands flowing over the botnet channel. The command-level
   traffic analysis presents decisive attack features because commands are
   transmitted according to strategies developed by the attackers. The
   proposed malicious domain detection method, on the other hand, exploited
   the tendency of the attackers to create domains in batches. Previous
   researchers focused on how benign and malicious domains were registered
   and used on the name servers. The proposed method, on the other hand,
   focuses on the arrival rate of SMS messages with URL links. The error
   rates become significantly small when users do not receive such messages
   very often.},

   laypersons, as experts in the field are usually expected to be aware of
   the risks posed by human-centered attacks such as phishing. In a lab
   study with 48 participants from IT-related study programs, we studied
   their phishing investigation behavior using an eye tracker across three
   email classification sessions. Between the first two sessions,
   participants received additional training on detecting phishing attacks.
   The third session, one week later served to measure retention of
   performance. Exposure to the teaching material particularly showed to
   decrease investigation time required for the classification. Further, it
   helped participants focus on the important indicators inside the
   phishing emails.},

Abstract = {A 3-dimensional (3D) printed custom-frame can improve the peripheral
   seal of readily available surgical/medical masks. This study aimed to
   assess the acceptance of a 3D-printed custom-frame with the American
   Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) surgical/medical masks and the
   use of a face shield. A total of 206 subjects from a dental school
   participated, who answered a multiple-choice questionnaire. Participants
   received an invitation through the institutional email of the school via
   Qualtrics platform. 3D printed custom-frames were fabricated for each
   participant. According to their response, participants were divided into
   4 groups: mask only (M), mask and frame (MF), mask and face shield
   (MFS), and all 3 personal protective equipment (MFFS). Data was analyzed
   in absolute and relative frequency. The acceptance of a 3D-printed
   custom-frame in the group MFFS varied between ``poor{''}/{''}very
   poor{''} (44.7\%). It allowed ``good{''} performance of routine
   procedures (40.3\%), but ``poor{''} visual quality (48.1\%).
   Musculoskeletal tolerance and ease to perform movements were adequate.
   There was no interference in olfactory sensitivity (44.7\%) or in the
   ability to breathe (34.5\%). Finally, it showed ``moderate pain{''}
   (48.1\%) on the ear and ``no pain{''} (38.9\%) on the head. The
   3D-printed custom-frame adapted to ASTM surgical/medical face masks
   showed reasonable tolerance. Side effects of ear pain ranging in degrees
   were noted. Further research is indicated to evaluate safety, comfort,
   compliance, side effects, and occupational hazards of long-term use of
   enhanced PPE recommendations.Avoiding the recurrent outbreaks of
   COVID-19, the use of PPE by the public is necessary. Improper PPE use is
   a major source of concern for human and environmental health. Preventing
   such activities can be done by following steps involved in PPE disposals
   or by getting a new way to re-use such as improving peripherical
   sealing. Our work highlights that a custom-frame can improve protection,
   without adverse effects.},

   (store and forward, real-time interactive, and hybrid modalities using
   web-based systems, email, mobile phones, tablets, or videoconferencing
   equipment), (iv) business models, (v) integration of teledermatology
   into national healthcare systems, (vi) preconditions and requirements
   for implementation (security, ethical issues, responsibility,
   reimbursement, user satisfaction, technique, and technology standards),
   and (vii) added value.
   To conclude, teledermatology is an efficient and effective healthcare
   service compared to in-person care. Teledermatology reduces patients'
   travel time and waiting time, avoids (unnecessary) dermatologic visits,
   and improves access of care to underserved patients.},

Abstract = {In this paper we present an approach for enabling the formation of a
   Joint Service, heterogeneous Airborne Network. Central to this approach
   will be the definition of a Joint Airborne Network Services Suite
   (JANSS). The JANSS will consist of a common set of integrated features
   and functions that can be implemented on all airborne platforms to
   enable those platforms to participate in the future IP-based Airborne
   Network The JANSS will include the functionality necessary to enable the
   exchange of IP-based data using either existing legacy voice/data
   radios, network-enabled commercial terminals, or emerging
   network-enabled military radios. Although integrated, the JANSS will be
   modular in nature, capable of being adapted, expanded, or enhanced, as
   needed, to support a particular platform's needs. Also, it will allow
   for implementation using various possible hardware and software
   solutions.
   The JANSS will incorporate a set of user application services to
   include: (1) collaboration tools such as text chat, email, and voice
   over IP (VoIP); (2) file transfers; (3) video streaming;, and (4) web
   services. It will also include security and networking services such as:
   access control, authentication, intrusion detection, routing, quality of
   service (QoS), and network management. The services provided by the
   JANSS will be capable of being implemented incrementally and will allow
   for compatibility with legacy and future military communication systems.},

Abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the private-data
   pertaining to the interaction of users with social media applications
   that can be recovered from second-hand Android devices.
   Design/methodology/approach This study uses a black-box
   testing-principles based methodology to develop use-cases that simulate
   real-world case-scenarios of the activities performed by the users on
   the social media application. The authors executed these use-cases in a
   controlled experiment and examined the Android smartphone to recover the
   private-data pertaining to these use-cases. Findings The results suggest
   that the social media data recovered from Android devices can reveal a
   complete timeline of activities performed by the user, identify all the
   videos watched, uploaded, shared and deleted by the user, disclose the
   username and user-id of the user, unveil the email addresses used by the
   user to download the application and share the videos with other users
   and expose the social network of the user on the platform. Forensic
   investigators may find this data helpful in investigating crimes such as
   cyber bullying, racism, blasphemy, vehicle thefts, road accidents and so
   on. However, this data-breach in Android devices is a threat to user's
   privacy, identity and profiling in second-hand market. Practical
   implications Perceived notion of data sanitisation as a result of
   application removal and factory-reset can have serious implications.
   Though being helpful to forensic investigators, it leaves the user
   vulnerable to privacy breach, identity theft, profiling and social
   network revealing in second-hand market. At the same time, users'
   sensitivity towards data-breach might compel users to refrain from
   selling their Android devices in second-hand market and hamper device
   recycling. Originality/value This study attempts to bridge the
   literature gap in social media data-breach in second-hand Android
   devices by experimentally determining the extent of the breach. The
   findings of this study can help digital forensic investigators in
   solving crimes such as vehicle theft, road accidents, cybercrimes and so
   on. It can assist smartphone users to decide whether to sell their
   smartphones in a second-hand market, and at the same time encourage
   developers and researchers to design methods of social media data
   sanitisation.},

Abstract = {Objective To examine whether psychosocial health mediates the
   association between food insecurity and grade point average (GPA) among
   college and university students. Design Data for the present study are
   from a longitudinal cohort study. Structural equation modelling (SEM)
   was used to test the proposed mediation hypothesis. Food insecurity was
   measured using the US Department of Agriculture's Six-Item Short Form.
   Psychosocial health was operationalized as a latent factor with three
   indicators: depression, anxiety and hope. Validated scales were used to
   measure each indicator. GPA was self-reported. Setting Seven colleges
   and universities in Georgia, USA. Participants Students aged 18-25 years
   were recruited via email and surveyed every four months over a two-year
   period (analytic n 2377). Results Approximately 29 \% of students were
   food insecure. In the final SEM, food insecurity was associated
   (standardized beta, se) with poorer psychosocial health (0.22, 0.03,
   P<0.0001) and poorer psychosocial health was associated with a lower GPA
   (-0.21, 0.03, P<0.0001). The indirect effect of food security status on
   GPA, as mediated by psychosocial health, was significant (-0.05, 0.01,
   P<0.0001) and accounted for 73 \% of the total effect. After accounting
   for psychosocial health, the direct effect of food security status on
   GPA was not significant (-0.02, 0.02, P=0.43). Conclusions Psychosocial
   health may be an important mechanism through which food insecurity
   affects academic performance among college and university students.
   Multicomponent interventions that address immediate food security needs
   as well as co-occurring mental health and academic concerns are needed
   to ensure student success.},

Abstract = {Objectives Clinical decision support (CDS) can potentially help
   clinicians identify and manage patients who are at risk for torsades de
   pointes (TdP). However, computer alerts are often ignored and might
   contribute to alert fatigue. The goals of this project were to create an
   advanced TdP CDS advisory that presents patient-specific, relevant
   information, including 1-click management options, and to determine
   clinician satisfaction with the CDS. Methods The advanced TdP CDS was
   developed and implemented across a health system comprising 29
   hospitals. The advisory presents patient-specific information including
   relevant risk factors, laboratory values, and 1-click options to help
   manage the condition in high-risk patients. A short electronic survey
   was created to gather clinician feedback on the advisory. Results After
   implementation, an email invitation to complete the anonymous
   advisory-related survey was sent to 442 clinicians who received the
   advisory. Among the 38 respondents, feedback was generally positive,
   with 79\% of respondents reporting that the advisory helps them care for
   their patients and 87\% responding that alternative actions for them to
   consider were clearly specified. However, 46\% of respondents indicated
   the alert appeared too frequently. Conclusions Advanced TdP risk CDS
   that provides relevant, patient-specific information and 1-click
   management options can be generally viewed favorably by clinicians who
   receive the advisory.},

Abstract = {Electronic mailing lists are ubiquitous community-forging tools that
   serve the important needs of Internet users, both experienced and
   novice. The most popular mailing list managers generally use textual
   mail-based interfaces for all list operations, from subscription
   management to list administration. Unfortunately, anecdotal evidence
   suggests that most mailing list users, and many list administrators and
   moderators are novice to intermediate computer users; textual interfaces
   are often difficult to use effectively.
   This paper describes Mailman, the GNU mailing list manager, which offers
   a dramatic step forward in usability and integration over other mailing
   list management systems. Mailman brings to list management an integrated
   Web interface for nearly all aspects of mailing list interaction,
   including subscription requests and option settings by members, list
   configuration and Web page editing by list administrators, and post
   approvals by list moderators. Mailman offers a mix of robustness,
   functionality and ease of installation and use that is unsurpassed by
   other freely available mailing list managers. Thus, it offers great
   benefits to site administrators, list administrators and end users
   alike. Mailman is primarily implemented in Python, a free,
   object-oriented scripting language; there are a few C wrapper programs
   for security.
   Mailman's architecture is based on a centralized list-oriented database
   that contains configuration options for each list. This allows for
   several unique and flexible administrative mechanisms. In addition to
   Web access, traditional email-command based control and interactive
   manipulation via the Python interpreter are supported. Mailman also
   contains extensive bounce and anti-spam devices.
   While many of the features discussed in this paper are generally
   improvements over other mailing list packages, we will focus our
   comparisons on Majordomo, which is almost certainly the most widely used
   freely available mailing list manager at present.},

Title = {Delegation of Decryption Rights With Revocability From Learning With
   Errors},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {61163-61175},
Abstract = {The notion of decryption rights delegation was initially introduced by
   Blaze et al. in EURO-CRYPT 1998. It, defined as proxy re-encryption,
   allows a semi-trusted proxy to convert a ciphertext intended for a party
   to another ciphertext of the same plaintext, without knowledge of the
   underlying plaintext and decryption key. It has been explored to many
   real-world applications, e.g., encrypted email forwarding. However, the
   intrinsic all-or-nothing share feature of proxy re-encryption yields a
   limitation that the share cannot be revoked. This may hinder the
   scalability of its applications in practice. In this paper, for the
   first time, we define the concept of revocability in terms of decryption
   rights delegation. The novel concept enables data owner to revoke the
   shared decryption rights when needed. Inspired by the seminal
   lattice-based proxy re-encryption proposed in PKC 2014, we design a
   concrete lattice-based construction which satisfies the notion. In our
   construction, we make use of binary-tree structure to implement the
   revocation of decryption rights, so that the update of re-encryption key
   is reduced to O(logN) (instead of O(N)), where N is the maximum number
   of delegatee. Furthermore, the security of our scheme is based on the
   standard learning with errors problem (LWE problem), which could be
   reduced to the worst-case hard problems (such as GapSVP and SIVP) in the
   context of lattices. The scheme is chosen ciphertext secure in the
   standard model. As of independent interest, our scheme achieves both
   backward and forward security, which means that once a user is revoked
   after a time period t, it cannot gain access to all encrypted files
   before and after t.},

Abstract = {We introduce a natural cryptographic functionality called functional
   re-encryption. Informally, this functionality, for a public-key
   encryption scheme and a function F with n possible outputs, transforms
   ({''}re-encrypts{''}) an encryption of a message m under an ``input
   public key{''} pk into an encryption of the same message m under one of
   the n ``output public keys{''}, namely the public key indexed by F(m).
   In many settings, one might require that the program implementing the
   functional re-encryption functionality should reveal nothing about both
   the input secret key sk as well as the function F. As an example,
   consider a user Alice who wants her email server to share her incoming
   mail with one of a set of n recipients according to an access policy
   specified by her function F, but who wants to keep this access policy
   private from the server. Furthermore, in this setting, we would ideally
   obtain an even stronger guarantee: that this information remains hidden
   even when some of the n recipients may be corrupted.
   To formalize these issues, we introduce the notion of
   collusion-resistant obfuscation and define this notion with respect to
   average-case secure obfuscation (Hohenberger et al. - TCC 2007). We then
   provide a construction of a functional re-encryption scheme for any
   function F with a polynomial-size domain and show that it satisfies this
   notion of collusion-resistant obfuscation. We note that
   collusion-resistant security can be viewed as a special case of
   dependent auxiliary input security (a setting where virtually no
   positive results are known), and this notion may be of independent
   interest.
   Finally, we show that collusion-resistant obfuscation of functional
   reencryption for a function F gives a way to obfuscate F in the sense of
   Barak et al. (CRYPTO 2001), indicating that this task is impossible for
   arbitrary (polynomial-time computable) functions F.},

Title = {Variability in pelvic packing practices for hemodynamically unstable
   pelvic fractures at US level 1 trauma centers},
Journal = {PATIENT SAFETY IN SURGERY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Month = {JAN 16},
Abstract = {Background: Mortality from hemodynamically unstable pelvic fractures
   remains high. Guidelines offer varying care approaches including the use
   of pelvic packing (PP), which was recently adopted for potential control
   of bleeding for this condition. However, the implementation of PP is
   uncertain as the debate on the optimal resuscitation strategy,
   angioembolization or PP continues. The study was designed to assess
   current practices among level 1 trauma centers in the US in regard to PP
   treatment for hemodynamically unstable pelvic fractures.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was created to assess when to apply
   PP, application approach, and the respondent's anecdotal perception on
   safety and effectiveness. Trauma Medical Directors at 158 US level 1
   trauma centers were sent biweekly email invitations for 3 months.
   Participants were allowed to skip questions for any reason. The study
   hypothesis was that PP practices vary by US census bureau region, annual
   trauma admissions, and length of time in years since each trauma center
   received their respective level 1 trauma center designation.
   Results: Twenty-five percent (40/158) of trauma medical directors
   participated and 75\% (118/158) of the trauma medical directors did not
   participate. Of those who took the survey, 36/40 (90\%) completed the
   survey and 4/40 (10\%) partially completed the survey. Only 36 trauma
   medical directors responded on their perception of safety and
   effectiveness; 72\% (26/36) of participants perceived PP as safe,
   whereas only a third (12/36) of participants perceived PP as effective.
   There were 25 trauma medical directors who provided the sequence of
   treatment modalities utilized at their level 1 trauma center, 76\%
   (19/25) of participants reported that PP is utilized as the third or
   fourth priority. None of the participating level 1 trauma centers
   reported a preference towards utilization of PP as the first priority
   treatment. Half of the participants reported a preference towards
   applying PP only as a last resort to control hemorrhage. Northeastern
   and Western level 1 trauma centers were significantly more likely than
   Midwestern and Southern level 1 trauma centers to have reported
   application of PP to all hemodynamically unstable patients (p = 0.05).
   Midwestern, Southern, and Western level 1 trauma centers were
   significantly more likely to have perceived PP as safe than Northeastern
   level 1 trauma centers (p = 0.04). All low-volume and 38\% high-volume
   level 1 trauma centers perceived PP to increase infection risks, (p =
   0.03). We observed no association between the length of time each trauma
   center was designated a level 1 trauma center, and all participant
   responses.
   Conclusion: Controversy and varying anecdotal perception regarding
   safety and effectiveness of PP prevails among trauma medical directors
   at level 1 trauma centers in the US.},

Title = {Internet-Based HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infection Testing in British
   Columbia, Canada: Opinions and Expectations of Prospective Clients},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},

Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {Background: The feasibility and acceptability of Internet-based sexually
   transmitted infection (STI) testing have been demonstrated; however, few
   programs have included testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
   In British Columbia, Canada, a new initiative will offer online access
   to chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV testing, integrated with
   existing clinic-based services. We presented the model to gay men and
   other men who have sex with men (MSM) and existing clinic clients
   through a series of focus groups.
   Objective: To identify perceived benefits, concerns, and expectations of
   a new model for Internet-based STI and HIV testing among potential end
   users.
   Methods: Participants were recruited through email invitations, online
   classifieds, and flyers in STI clinics. A structured interview guide was
   used. Focus groups were audio recorded, and an observer took detailed
   field notes. Analysts then listened to audio recordings to validate
   field notes. Data were coded and analyzed using a scissor-and-sort
   technique.
   Results: In total, 39 people participated in six focus groups. Most were
   MSM, and all were active Internet users and experienced with STI/HIV
   testing. Perceived benefits of Internet-based STI testing included
   anonymity, convenience, and client-centered control. Salient concerns
   were reluctance to provide personal information online, distrust of
   security of data provided online, and the need for comprehensive pretest
   information and support for those receiving positive results,
   particularly for HIV. Suggestions emerged for mitigation of these
   concerns: provide up-front and detailed information about the model, ask
   only the minimal information required for testing, give positive results
   only by phone or in person, and ensure that those testing positive are
   referred for counseling and support. End users expected Internet testing
   to offer continuous online service delivery, from booking appointments,
   to transmitting information to the laboratory, to getting prescriptions.
   Most participants said they would use the service or recommend it to
   others. Those who indicated they would be unlikely to use it generally
   either lived near an STI clinic or routinely saw a family doctor with
   whom they were comfortable testing. Participants expected that the
   service would provide the greatest benefit to individuals who do not
   already have access to sensitive sexual health services, are reluctant
   to test due to stigma, or want to take immediate action (eg, because of
   a recent potential STI/HIV exposure).
   Conclusions: Internet-based STI/HIV testing has the potential to reduce
   barriers to testing, as a complement to existing clinic-based services.
   Trust in the new online service, however, is a prerequisite to client
   uptake and may be engendered by transparency of information about the
   model, and by accounting for concerns related to confidentiality, data
   usage, and provision of positive (especially HIV) results. Ongoing
   evaluation of this new model will be essential to its success and to the
   confidence of its users.},

   resulting in an individualized purchasing experience. The system of
   recommendation used to predict or recommend the product according to the
   taste of customer. In today's life product recommendation system has
   been used by different E-Commerce sites. A website that allows people to
   buy and sell physical things, services, and digital products without
   having to go to a physical store. Through an e-commerce website, a
   company can manage orders, payments, shipping and logistics, and
   customer service. Recommendation can be of any type such as for music
   recommendation there is Spotify, for movies Netflix, for videos YouTube,
   play store (for different categories) and so on. For the recommendation
   of product different filtering methods and algorithms were used, to
   recommend products according to user's likeness. In this paper discussed
   about the existing Machine Learning Techniques (MLT) which were used for
   the product recommendation. Through these techniques the algorithm is
   used to predict or similar items according to user's likeness based on

Year = {2019},
Volume = {26},
Number = {5},

Month = {NOV 11},
Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to propose a structured threat information
   expression (STIX)-based data representation for privacy-preserving data
   analysis to report format and semantics of specific data types and to
   represent sticky policies in the format of embedded human-readable data
   sharing agreements (DSAs). More specifically, the authors exploit and
   extend the STIX standard to represent in a structured way analysis-ready
   pieces of data and the attached privacy policies.
   Design/methodology/approach The whole scheme is designed to be
   completely compatible with the STIX 2.0 standard for cyber-threat
   intelligence (CTI) representation. The proposed scheme will be
   implemented in this work by defining the complete scheme for
   representing an email, which is more expressive than the standard one
   defined for STIX, designed specifically for spam email analysis.
   Findings Moreover, the paper provides a new scheme for general DSA
   representation that has been practically applied for the process of
   encoding specific attributes in different CTI reports. Originality/value
   This paper has covered the existing gap including the lack of generality
   in DSA representation for privacy-preserving analysis of structured CTI.
   Therefore, the new model for DSA representation was introduced, as well
   as its practical implementation.},

Abstract = {Opioid dependence is largely an undertreated medical condition in the
   United States. The introduction of buprenorphine has created the
   potential to expand access to and use of opioid agonist treatment in
   generalist settings. Physicians, however, often have limited training
   and experience providing this type of care. Some physicians believe
   having a mentoring relationship with an experienced provider during
   their initial introduction to the use of buprenorphine would ease
   implementation. Our goal was to describe the development,
   implementation, resources, and evaluation of the Physician Clinical
   Support System-Buprenorphine (PCSS-B), a federally funded program to
   improve access to and quality of treatment with buprenorphine. We
   provide a description of the PCSS-B, a national network of 88 trained
   physician mentors with expertise in buprenorphine treatment and skills
   in clinical education. We provide information regarding the use the
   PCSS-B core services including telephone, email and in-person support, a
   website, clinical guidances, a warmline and outreach to primary care and
   specialty organizations. Between July 2005 and July 2009, 67 mentors and
   4 clinical experts reported providing mentoring services to 632
   participants in 48 states, Washington DC and Puerto Rico. A total of
   1,455 contacts were provided through email (45\%), telephone (34\%) and
   in-person visits (20\%). Seventy-six percent of contacts addressed a
   clinical issue. Eighteen percent of contacts addressed a logistical
   issue. The number of contacts per participant ranged from 1-125. Between
   August 2005 and April 2009 there were 72,822 visits to the PCSS-B
   website with 179,678 pages viewed. Seven guidances were downloaded more
   than 1000 times. The warmline averaged more than 100 calls per month.
   The PCSS-B model provides support for a mentorship program to assist
   non-specialty physicians in the provision of buprenorphine and may serve
   as a model for dissemination of other types of care.},

Title = {The use of technology platforms for nutrition education in cirrhosis: A
   cross-sectional study of patients' acceptability and capabilities},
Journal = {CANADIAN LIVER JOURNAL},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {0},

Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Background: Few nutrition education strategies using technology have
   been developed and evaluated for patients with cirrhosis. This study
   aims to describe the receptivity of these patients to technology-based
   nutrition education, specifically assessing their interest, preferences,
   Internet attitudes, technological skills with computers and mobile
   devices, and factors associated with their interest in such educational
   approaches.Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among patients
   with cirrhosis. Questionnaires included participant characteristics,
   interest, preferences and ownership of technology, Internet Attitude
   Scale (IAS), Computer Proficiency Questionnaire-12 (CPQ-12), Mobile
   Device Proficiency Questionnaire-16 (MDPQ-16), and Household Food
   Security Survey Module (HFSSM).Results: 77 patients were included (mean
   age 63.1, 57.1\% male); 68.8\% had post-secondary education, and 11.7\%
   were food insecure. The primary etiologies were mixed (27.3\%),
   metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) (24.7\%), and
   alcoholic liver disease (ALD) (19.5\%). Most patients (72.7\%) were
   interested in receiving nutrition education through technology.
   Interested patients showed higher proficiency and better attitude toward
   the Internet. ALD was more prevalent among patients not interested in
   technological nutritional education. Univariate analysis identified
   proficiency, attitude toward the Internet, ALD diagnosis, and tablet
   ownership as predictors of interest. Multivariate analysis confirmed
   tablet ownership and Internet attitude as significant factors. Preferred
   educational formats were documents (59.7\%) and video clips (57.1\%) by
   email, and pre-recorded online courses (57.1\%).Conclusion: Patients
   with cirrhosis are generally receptive to technology-based nutrition
   education, though barriers may include lower technological proficiency
   and a negative attitude toward the Internet. Enhancing patients'
   technological skills could increase their willingness to use technology
   for educational purposes, particularly among ALD patients.},

Month = {JUN 12},
Abstract = {Fake identities have proven to be an effective methodology for
   conducting privacy and cybersecurity research; however, existing models
   are limited in their ability to interact with and respond to received
   communications. To perform privacy research in more complex Internet
   domains, withstand enhanced scrutiny, and persist long-term, fake
   identities must be capable of automatically generating responses while
   maintaining consistent behavior and personality. This work proposes a
   method for assigning personality to fake identities using the widely
   accepted psychometric Big Five model. Leveraging this model, the
   potential application of large language models (LLMs) to generate email
   responses that emulate human personality traits is investigated to
   enhance fake identity capabilities for privacy research at scale.},

Abstract = {Computational simulations have become an indispensible tool in a wide
   variety of science and engineering investigations. Nearly all scientific
   computation and analyses create transient data and preliminary results,
   these may consist of text, binary files and visualization images. Quick
   and effective assessments of these data are necessary for efficient use
   of the computation resources, but this is complicated when a large
   collaborating team is geographically dispersed and/or some team members
   do not have direct access to the computation resource and output data.
   Current methods for sharing and assessing transient data and preliminary
   results are cumbersome, labor intensive, and largely unsupported by
   useful tools and procedures. Each research team is forced to create
   their own scripts and ad hoc procedures to push data from system to
   system, and user to user, and to make quick plots, images, and videos to
   guide the next step in their research. These custom efforts often rely
   on email, ftp, and scp, despite the ubiquity of much more flexible
   dynamic web-based technologies and the impressive display and
   interaction abilities of today's mobile devices.
   To fill this critical gap we have developed SeedMe (Swiftly Encode,
   Explore and Disseminate My Experiments), is a web-based architecture to
   enable the rapid sharing of content directly from applications running
   on High Performance Computing or cloud resources. SeedMe converts a
   slow, manual, serial, error prone, repetitive, and redundant sharing and
   assessment process into a streamlined automatic and web accessible
   cyberinfrastructure. We provide an easy to use sharing model with
   granular access control, and mobile device support. SeedMe provides
   secure input and output complementing HPC resources, without
   compromising their security model, and thereby expand and extend their
   capabilities. SeedMe aims to foster rapid assessment, iteration,
   communication, and dissemination of transient data and preliminary
   results by seeding content that can be accessed via a simple
   collaborative web interface.},

Title = {Impact of Secondary Tasks on Individual Drivers: Not All Drivers Are

Journal = {SAE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PASSENGER CARS-ELECTRONIC AND ELECTRICAL
   SYSTEMS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {5},

Pages = {414-420},
Abstract = {There has been rapid growth in the mobile-phone industry in terms of
   technology and growing number of users with migration into the car
   environment. There is also a significant demand for smart phones capable
   of accessing email, listening to music, organizing daily activities,
   linking to social networking sites, while the user is on the move. The
   automotive industry has been significantly impacted by such mobile-phone
   usage. Driving a car is a complicated and skillful task requiring
   attention and focus. However many people perceive driving to be easy -
   second-to-habit or an extension of their natural skills. This
   complacency encourages drivers to multitask while driving. While many
   drivers manage this multitasking comfortably, it becomes a distraction
   and contributes to increased risk while driving for some. Since the
   effect of multitasking is variable on different drivers, it is important
   to understand its impact on individual drivers. This study focuses on
   assessing the impact of several secondary tasks such as speaking over a
   hand-held mobile phone, tuning the radio, selecting songs from an MP3/CD
   playlist, speaking to a co-passenger, on individual drivers. To assess
   the driver activity, we formulate stochastic models such as Gaussian
   Mixture Models (GMM) using only CAN-bus signals collected on-road in
   real world driving situations from the UTDrive corpus. We also
   categorize drivers based on their distraction level into (1) least
   impacted, (2) moderately impacted, and (3) most impacted drivers. As the
   automotive industry further advances in developing active safety
   systems, such driver centric adaptive systems will help in personalizing
   the vehicle by triggering active safety systems only when drivers are
   impacted or when they show tendencies of such impact. This will help
   motivate drivers to use active safety systems rather than disabling them
   because they are annoyed.},

Abstract = {The prevalence of fake academic certificates in the country is worrying.
   This is evidently shown during the vetting and recruitment process of
   candidates into the job market. In order to curb the fraudulent use of
   fake qualifications, institutions have taken measures that usually
   involve a third party to verify the authenticity of educational
   certificates. The main weaknesses of this approach is that the time
   taken to verify certificates is too long. In addition to that, using an
   intermediary introduces aspects such as extra costs and the potential
   inaccessibility to institutions in various geographical locations.
   This project proposes a model that digitise certificates using the
   Ethereum Blockchain technology. Its desirable features like
   immutability, distributed peer-to-peer network and creation of
   decentralized applications using smart contracts, will aid in curbing
   this problem. Further, it is permissioned and allows for provenance.
   These features will enable the following:
   1. Creation of digital certificates which can be shared and validated
   online.
   2. Online verification of existing certificates to ascertain their
   authenticity
   3. Quick online reference of people's credentials from anywhere without
   the need to directly contact the institution in question. In cases where
   the institution ceases to exist, the verification of the certificate
   will be possible.
   This research intends to develop a system that can address the issue of
   fake certificates. Agile methodology is the proposed software
   methodology for the solution development. A questionnaire was used to
   gauge user interest and readiness for a blockchain system for the
   management of academic credentials. The target respondents were
   Strathmore University students ranging from age 18-40 years. The
   percentage of men was 62.8\% and women 37.2\%. Majority of the
   respondents were undergraduate students at 91.5\%. On analyzing the
   current practices of the respondents in the maintenance of their
   academic certificates, 58\% maintain both the physical and scanned
   copies of their documents. Less than 1\% have their documents stored in
   a safe for a cost. In situations when academic credentials were
   requested, two modes of submission indicated the highest percentage.
   These are:
   1. Sending the scanned documents via email (67\%)
   2. Physically obtaining the stamped certificate from the issuing
   institution (65.2\%) 91.4\% of the respondents approve of a system that
   can digitally store these academic certificates allowing for easy access
   and sharing.
   Among the reasons given for the openness to a digital system for
   maintaining academic credentials are: Convenience, security and ease of
   access, safety and durability, ease of sharing with interested parties
   and portability. The respondents who expressed doubts about maintaining
   and storing their academic credentials online shared the following
   concerns: Privacy, security and forgery.},

Abstract = {Social networking has positively impacted the realm of human
   interactivity. Although libraries have traditionally been viewed as a
   place for research and information seeking, Web 2.0 technologies, such
   as blogs and Instant Messaging (IM), are starting to change users'
   experiences of current library services.
   In this study we aim to examine whether the opportunity for enhanced
   researcher-librarian interaction that Web 2.0 tools provide creates a
   synergistic experience for health research interest groups. In addition,
   we will explore whether these tools increase efficiency in obtaining
   information and/or improve quality and quantity of research evidence.
   This study was conducted by two hospital librarians working in tertiary
   hospitals. An email was distributed to the health care professionals
   from these two sites, inviting participation in two online research
   interest groups: Clinical Practice Guidelines and Patient Safety. A
   pre-survey of participants was intended to assess the comfort level of
   this group with Web 2.0 tools and to gauge their level of use both
   professionally and personally. We created a Virtual Interest Group (VIG)
   environment to incorporate the following Web 2.0 tools into the existing
   library website: user blogs, enabling commenting to facilitate a
   knowledge-sharing atmosphere; chat software to assist with easy access
   to acquired information; and Delicious tagging for a more systematic
   documentation of grey literature. A post-survey was conducted three
   months later in order to re-evaluate the participants' experiences with
   social media, in particular with the online interest group environment.
   Findings from this study can be used to highlight future trends around
   the discoverability of grey literature with social media tools and to
   establish a basis for integrating Web 2.0 tools in library websites and
   services.},

Abstract = {Alpenhorn is the first system for initiating an encrypted connection
   between two users that provides strong privacy and forward secrecy
   guarantees for metadata (i.e., information about which users connected
   to each other) and that does not require out-of-band communication other
   than knowing the other user's Alpenhorn username (email address). This
   resolves a significant shortcoming in all prior works on private
   messaging, which assume an out-of-band key distribution mechanism.
   Alpenhorn's design builds on three ideas. First, Alpenhorn provides each
   user with an address book of friends that the user can call. Second,
   when a user adds a friend for the first time, Alpenhorn ensures the
   adversary does not learn the friend's identity, by using identity-based
   encryption in a novel way to privately determine the friend's public
   key. Finally, when calling a friend, Alpenhorn ensures forward secrecy
   of metadata by storing pairwise shared secrets in friends' address
   books, and evolving them over time, using a new keywheel construction.
   Alpenhorn relies on a number of servers, but operates in an anytrust
   model, requiring just one of the servers to be honest.
   We implemented a prototype of Alpenhorn, and integrated it into the
   Vuvuzela private messaging system (which did not previously provide
   privacy or forward secrecy of metadata when initiating conversations).
   Experimental results show that Alpenhorn can scale to many users,
   supporting 10 million users on three Alpenhorn servers with an average
   dial latency of 150 seconds and a client bandwidth overhead of 3.7
   KB/sec.},

Abstract = {Background Digital recording and storage of health data are becoming
   increasingly important in the fields of both human and veterinary
   medicine. There is currently a lack of information on the level of
   digitalisation among equine veterinarians in Germany and their attitudes
   towards advanced digitalisation.ObjectivesTo collect opinions of equine
   veterinarians about (1) digital data collection in pre-purchase
   examinations (PPEs), and (2) the establishment of an equine health
   database in Germany.Study designCross-sectional survey.Methods An online
   survey was developed and distributed via email exclusively to equine
   veterinarians in Germany. After 40 days of data collection, answers were
   used for descriptive statistical analyses.Results The survey was sent to
   1055 recipients, of which 147 (13.9\%) participated and 130 survey
   responses from equine veterinarians could be used for analyses. Most
   respondents were working in an equine practice (77.9\%) and performing
   PPEs (93.8\%), for which they mostly used printed protocols (86.0\%).
   The PPE protocol of the German Equine Veterinary Association as a paper
   print was the format most frequently used (47.1\%). The majority of
   participating equine veterinarians (90.2\%) would use a digital protocol
   for PPEs if available. Concerns were expressed about user-friendliness
   (55.9\%) and integration into the daily veterinary routine (54.6\%).
   Regarding the establishment of an equine health database, 72.3\% of the
   respondents stated they would appreciate it. However, about one-third
   would support such a development only under certain conditions:
   guaranteed data safety, collection of objective data or involving the
   opinion of other stakeholders.Main limitations Low response rate,
   potential non-response bias and wide range of question topics.Conclusion
   A positive attitude towards digital PPEs and an equine health database
   in Germany became apparent. To facilitate further progress, it would be
   crucial to consider the concerns and conditions identified in this study
   to generate maximum compliance.},

Abstract = {Software for electronic prescriptions offers healthcare providers
   numerous benefits including increased patient safety, prescribing
   effectiveness, workflow efficiencies, and financial savings.
   Particularly due to recent legislation, an increasing number of
   organizations are adopting this software. Yet, there are many concerns
   and risks associated with e-prescription technologies. Despite increased
   prescribing effectiveness, there is still the potential for human error.
   Many software concerns including integration and the implementation of
   specific transactions like CancelRx still need to be addressed.
   Additionally, some patients have negative perceptions of e-Rx that must
   be overcome. To this effect, this research conducts risk assessment of
   two real world cases (the CVS Pharmacy (retail setting) and the
   Ascension Seton (inpatient setting)) using the NIST risk model. The
   study concludes that the top three challenges in the pharmacy domain are
   comprised of a lack in the implementation of essential software
   functionalities, the loss and theft of portable devices, and errors due
   to email phishing attacks.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a motion planning algorithm for quadruped locomotion
   based on density functions. We decompose the locomotion problem into a
   high-level density planner and a model predictive controller (MPC). Due
   to density functions having a physical interpretation through the notion
   of occupancy, it is intuitive to represent the environment with safety
   constraints. Hence, there is an ease of use to constructing the planning
   problem with density. The proposed method uses a simplified the model of
   the robot into an integrator system, where the high-level plan is in a
   feedback form formulated through an analytically constructed density
   function. We then use the MPC to optimize the reference trajectory, in
   which a low-level PID controller is used to obtain the torque level
   control. The overall framework is implemented in simulation,
   demonstrating our feedback density planner for legged locomotion. The
   implementation of work is available at

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Pages = {81-88},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Objectives The study aimed to issue a bulletin which provides
   information on new medicines released on the Maltese market and on
   changes in Summary of Product Characteristics specific to the local
   scenario.
   Method Lists of new medicinal products and locally available medicines
   that had undergone variation were compiled. In order to avoid bias,
   information was further obtained from regulatory authorities. A concise
   article was written on each drug, reviewed by a panel of experts and
   then published in the bulletin. A questionnaire was developed, validated
   and distributed with the bulletin. Five hundred printed copies of the
   bulletin were self-administered to pharmacists from all areas of
   practice and to around 200 pharmacy students via electronic mail.
   Key findings The respondents agreed that the bulletin was: up to date,
   clear and concise (93\%, n(1) = 439; 92\%, n(2) = 426), user friendly
   (94\%, n(1) = 443; n(2) = 430) and useful (98\%, n(1) = 458; 97\%, n(2)
   = 448). There were 97\% (n(1) = 455) and 96\% (n(2) = 440) of the
   respondents following the first and second issues, respectively, that
   stated that the information present in the bulletin was new to them. In
   fact, 90\% (n(1) = 421) of respondents after the first issue and 94\%
   (n(2) = 432) in the second issue agreed that the bulletin helped them to
   keep informed.
   Conclusion Both issues of the bulletin provided an accessible means to
   deliver unbiased information about the introduction of recent medicinal
   products and variations on the local market. The bulletin was positively
   received by both pharmacists and pharmacy students.},

Abstract = {Study Design. Prospective evaluation of an informational webbased
   calculator for communicating estimates of personalized treatment
   outcomes.
   Objective. To evaluate the usability, effectiveness in communicating
   benefits and risks, and impact on decision quality of a calculator tool
   for patients with intervertebral disc herniations, spinal stenosis, and
   degenerative spondylolisthesis who are deciding between surgical and
   nonsurgical treatments.
   Summary of Background Data. The decision to have back surgery is
   preference-sensitive and warrants shared decision making. However, more
   patient-specific, individualized tools for presenting clinical evidence
   on treatment outcomes are needed.
   Methods. Using Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial data, prediction
   models were designed and integrated into a webbased calculator tool:
   http://spinesurgerycalc.dartmouth.edu/calc/. Consumer Reports
   subscribers with back-related pain were invited to use the calculator
   via email, and patient participants were recruited to use the calculator
   in a prospective manner following an initial appointment at
   participating spine centers. Participants completed questionnaires
   before and after using the calculator. We randomly assigned previously
   validated questions that tested knowledge about the treatment options to
   be asked either before or after viewing the calculator.
   Results. A total of 1256 consumer reports subscribers and 68 patient
   participants completed the calculator and questionnaires. Knowledge
   scores were higher in the postcalculator group compared to the
   precalculator group, indicating that calculator usage successfully
   informed users. Decisional conflict was lower when measured following
   calculator use, suggesting the calculator was beneficial in the
   decision-making process. Participants generally found the tool helpful
   and easy to use.
   Conclusion. Although the calculator is not a comprehensive decision aid,
   it does focus on communicating individualized risks and benefits for
   treatment options. Moreover, it appears to be helpful in achieving the
   goals of more traditional shared decision-making tools. It not only
   improved knowledge scores but also improved other aspects of decision
   quality.},

Abstract = {Though there are multiple reasons for road mishaps, the use of cell
   phones during driving is revealed to be the most alarming. Mobile
   phone-use while driving, regardless of whether text messages, browsing
   or voice calls, whether hand-held or hands-free reduces the focus and
   readiness of the driver, jeopardizing the safety of road users. In this
   research, the important task of detecting and controlling cell phone
   related driver distractions is addressed. The paper introduces a smart
   vehicle technology which could make the drivers more alert and focused
   during driving and also push them to refrain from offensive situations
   such as texting, browsing or calling while on roads. The approach is to
   use technology to automatically detect the driver's offensive gestures
   and consequently block the text, email and browser applications in his
   mobile device. The proposed safety enforcement applies only to the
   person in the driver's seat, and does not affect the mobile data
   connectivity of fellow passengers. The recommended system allows
   automatic service resumption in the parking mode or the safe-speed mode.
   The proposal is intended to get closer to the vision of safe and
   accident-free driving by providing a means to curb the preventable
   mishaps due to human negligence.},

Abstract = {Objectives: Care for older adults with cancer became more challenging
   during the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to examine cancer care
   providers' attitudes toward the barriers and facilitators related to the
   care for these patients during the pandemic.
   Materials and Methods: Members of the Advocacy Committee of the Cancer
   and Aging Research Group, along with the Association of Community Cancer
   Centers, developed the survey distributed to multidisciplinary
   healthcare providers responsible for the direct care of patients with
   cancer. Participants were recruited by email sent through four
   professional organizations' listservs, email blasts, and messages
   through social media.
   Results: Complete data was available from 274 respondents. Only 15.4\%
   had access to written guidelines that specifically address the
   management of older adults with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Age
   was ranked fifth as the reason for postponing treatment following
   comorbid conditions, cancer stage, frailty, and performance status.
   Barriers to the transition to telehealth were found at the patient-,
   healthcare worker-, and institutional-levels. Providers reported
   increased barriers in accessing basic needs among older adults with
   cancer. Most respondents agreed (86.3\%) that decision making about Do
   Not Resuscitate orders should be the result of discussion with the
   patient and the healthcare proxy in all situations. The top five
   concerns reported were related to patient safety, treatment delays,
   healthcare worker mental health and burnout, and personal safety for
   family and self.
   Conclusion: These findings demand resources and support allocation for
   older adults with cancer and healthcare providers during the COVID-19
   pandemic.

Title = {Physicians' Attitudes and Use of E-Cigarettes as Cessation Devices,
   North Carolina, 2013},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Volume = {9},

Abstract = {Introduction: Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are not currently
   approved or recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or
   various medical organizations; yet, they appear to play a substantial
   role in tobacco users' cessation attempts. This study reports on a
   physician survey that measured beliefs, attitudes, and behavior related
   to e-cigarettes and smoking cessation. To our knowledge this is the
   first study to measure attitudes toward e-cigarettes among physicians
   treating adult smokers.
   Methods: Using a direct marketing company, a random sample of 787 North
   Carolina physicians were contacted in 2013 through email, with 413
   opening the email and 128 responding (response rate = 31\%). Physicians'
   attitudes towards e-cigarettes were measured through a series of
   close-ended questions. Recommending e-cigarettes to patients served as
   the outcome variable for a logistic regression analysis.
   Results: Two thirds (67\%) of the surveyed physicians indicated
   e-cigarettes are a helpful aid for smoking cessation, and 35\%
   recommended them to their patients. Physicians were more likely to
   recommend e-cigarettes when their patients asked about them or when the
   physician believed e-cigarettes were safer than smoking standard
   cigarettes.
   Conclusions: Many North Carolina physicians are having conversations
   about e-cigarettes with their patients, and some are recommending them.
   Future FDA regulation of e-cigarettes may help provide evidence-based
   guidance to physicians about e-cigarettes and will help ensure that
   patients receive evidence-based recommendations about the safety and
   efficacy of e-cigarettes in tobacco cessation.},

Title = {Virtual Private Social Networks and a Facebook Implementation},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON THE WEB},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The popularity of Social Networking Sites (SNS) is growing rapidly, with
   the largest sites serving hundreds of millions of users and their
   private information. The privacy settings of these SNSs do not allow the
   user to avoid sharing some information (e. g., name and profile picture)
   with all the other users. Also, no matter the privacy settings, this
   information is always shared with the SNS (that could sell this
   information or be hacked). To mitigate these threats, we recently
   introduced the concept of Virtual Private Social Networks (VPSNs).
   In this work we propose the first complete architecture and
   implementation of VPSNs for Facebook. In particular, we address an
   important problem left unexplored in our previous research-that is the
   automatic propagation of updated profiles to all the members of the same
   VPSN. Furthermore, we made an in-depth study on performance and
   implemented several optimization to reduce the impact of VPSN on user
   experience.
   The proposed solution is lightweight, completely distributed, does not
   depend on the collaboration from Facebook, does not have a central point
   of failure, it offers (with some limitations) the same functionality as
   Facebook, and apart from some simple settings, the solution is almost
   transparent to the user. Thorough experiments, with an extended set of
   parameters, we have confirmed the feasibility of the proposal and have
   shown a very limited time-overhead experienced by the user while
   browsing Facebook pages.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present the first longitudinal measurement study of
   the underground ecosystem fueling credential theft and assess the risk
   it poses to millions of users. Over the course of March, 2016-March,
   2017, we identify 788,000 potential victims of off-the-shelf keyloggers;
   12.4 million potential victims of phishing kits; and 1.9 billion
   usernames and passwords exposed via data breaches and traded on
   blackmarket forums. Using this dataset, we explore to what degree the
   stolen passwords-which originate from thousands of online
   services-enable an attacker to obtain a victim's valid email
   credentials-and thus complete control of their online identity due to
   transitive trust. Drawing upon Google as a case study, we find 7-25\% of
   exposed passwords match a victim's Google account. For these accounts,
   we show how hardening authentication mechanisms to include additional
   risk signals such as a user's historical geolocations and device
   profiles helps to mitigate the risk of hijacking. Beyond these risk
   metrics, we delve into the global reach of the miscreants involved in
   credential theft and the blackhat tools they rely on. We observe a
   remarkable lack of external pressure on bad actors, with phishing kit
   playbooks and keylogger capabilities remaining largely unchanged since
   the mid-2000s.},

Title = {Defining the trials nurses' role in operationalising a medicinal

Journal = {COLLEGIAN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {29},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: With increasing use of medicinal cannabis for symptom
   management, clinical trials nurses need to consider the various legal,
   social, ethical, and interdisciplinary care issues of implementing these
   clinical trials, especially in a palliative care population.
   Aim: To define the trials nurses' role in operationalising a medicinal
   cannabis pharmacokinetic inpatient trial in an advanced cancer
   population.
   Methods: A qualitative, descriptive design incorporating case study
   methodology was used. Data were collected from minuted meetings, field
   notes, telephone, and email discussions involving trials nurses at two
   palliative care sites. Data were integrated and synthesised to identify
   the key considerations required to operationalise the trial and define
   the trials nurses' role.
   Findings: Three key considerations were identified: (i) Normalising the
   trial, (ii) Creating the environment to undertake the trial, and (iii)
   Managing the complexity. The trials nurses' role was explored through
   subthemes of these considerations including: their understanding of the
   purpose of the research and training in the protocol; organising
   inpatient resources, pharmacy requirements and managing the external
   scrutiny; participant recruitment, staffing requirements, safety, and
   supporting caregivers.
   Discussion: This study emphasises the multifactorial role of the trials
   nurses in managing a complex palliative care trial, and the importance
   of their early involvement and recognition as the vital link between all
   parties.
   Conclusion: Defining the trials nurses' role, within the confines of the
   protocol, the context of efficient nursing processes and ensuring a
   patient-centred approach enabled the operationalisation of a Phase I/II
   medicinal cannabis trial which will have global impact. (C) 2021

Title = {Tracheotomy-related catastrophic events: Results of a national survey},
Journal = {LARYNGOSCOPE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {122},
Number = {1},
Pages = {30-37},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Objectives/Hypothesis: To gather qualitative and semiquantitative
   information about catastrophic complications during and following
   tracheotomy. Study Design: National survey distributed to American
   Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery members via the Academy
   weekly email newsletter during April and May 2011. Methods: A total of
   478 respondents provided estimates of the number of four specific
   tracheotomy-related complications (innominate artery fistula, esophageal
   fistula, acute tracheotomy occlusion, and obstructing granuloma), all
   catastrophic events, and events resulting in death or permanent
   disability encountered during their careers. There were 253 respondents
   who provided 405 free-text descriptions of specific events. Results: The
   respondents experienced approximately one catastrophic event every 10
   years and one event resulting in death or permanent disability every 20
   years. More than 90\% occurred more than 1 week after surgery.
   Categories of physicians who experienced more events per year included
   academic physicians and laryngologists. Pediatric otolaryngologists had
   twice as many innominate artery fistulas per year of practice as others.
   Qualitative (free-text) descriptions of the most serious events
   demonstrated that more of these events involved loss of airway and
   volume bleeds, usually from innominate or carotid artery erosion. Many
   of the events due to airway loss involved potentially correctable
   deficits in family education, nursing care, home care, and other
   structural factors. Conclusions: Even when we allow for selection bias,
   these data suggest that a substantial number of tracheotomy
   complications leading to death or permanent disability occur at a
   national level. The vast majority of events occur more than 1 week after
   the procedure. Many of the described events were caused by factors that
   should be amenable to prospective system improvement strategies.},

Title = {Understanding phishers' strategies of mimicking uniform resource
   locators to leverage phishing attacks: A machine learning approach},
Journal = {SECURITY AND PRIVACY},
Year = {2020},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Phishing is a type of social engineering attackwith an intention to
   steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers,
   leading to financial losses for both organizations and individuals. It
   occurs when an attacker, pretending as a trusted entity, lure a victim
   into click on a link or attachment in an email, or in a text message.
   Phishing is often launched via email messages or text messages over
   social networks. Previous research has revealed that phishing attacks
   can be identified just by looking at uniform resource locator (URLs).
   Identifying the techniques which are used by phishers to mimic a
   phishing URL is rather a challenging issue. At present, we have limited
   knowledge and understanding of how cyber-criminals attempt to mimic URLs
   with the same look and feel of the legitimate ones, to entice people
   into clicking links. Therefore, this paper investigates the feature
   selection of phishingURLs (uniform resource locators), aiming to explore
   the strategies employed by phishers to mimic URLs that can obviously
   trick people into clicking links. We employed an information gain (IG)
   and Chi-Squared feature selectionmethods inmachine learning (ML) on a
   phishing dataset. The dataset contains a total of 48 features extracted
   from 5000 phishing and another 5000 legitimate URL fromweb pages
   downloaded fromJanuary to May 2015 and from May to June 2017. Our
   results revealed that there were 10 techniques that phishers used to
   mimic URLs to manipulate humans into clicking links. Identifying these
   phishing URL manipulation techniques would certainly help to educate
   individuals and organizations and keep them safe from phishing attacks.
   In addition, the findings of this research will also help develop
   anti-phishing tools, framework or browser plugins for phishing
   prevention.},

Title = {Antenatal care management platform},
Journal = {BMC DIGITAL HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {1},

Month = {DEC 12},
Abstract = {BackgroundPregnancy is a process of developing a fetus in a woman's womb
   leading to anatomical and physiological changes. Currently, numerous
   health facilities offering antenatal services are yet to adopt health
   informatics. This led to several challenges, including unskilled, early
   and poor quality antenatal and delivery care, case traffic because many
   patients are admitted per day, and shy medical professional doctors,
   nurses, midwives and nursing aids. The main idea of this project was to
   design and develop a new system for managing maternal health in
   antenatal care.MethodsThis web-based antenatal care management platform
   is designed using XAMPP, PHP, HTML and CSS. It involves designing the
   stoner interface and identifying the inputs, outputs, and processes of
   the designed system. The configuration involves the use of case
   diagrams, sequence diagrams and class diagram tools to achieve the
   physical consummation of the antenatal care management platform and
   positive living information system. The purpose of this work was to
   create a web-based platform for managing antenatal care.ResultsThe
   designed project was tested by using parameters such as WHO guidelines,
   security, user-friendliness and data storage. Three testing criteria,
   namely, unit testing, integration testing and system testing, were used
   to check the efficiency and effectiveness of the antenatal care
   management platform (ANCMP). The platform that was created met almost
   all of the criteria that were set out in the design.ConclusionThis
   project is objectively targeted to develop a web-based antenatal care
   management system to overcome the complications that occur during and
   following gestation.It controls the overall conditioning of antenatal
   care, which includes the enrollment of expectant mothers, shadowing of
   the listed day and reminding them via email and effectively recording
   and saving all medical information about the mothers.ConclusionThis

Abstract = {The World Wide Web supports a wide range of criminal activities such as
   spam-advertised e-commerce, financial fraud and malware dissemination.
   Although the precise motivations behind these schemes may differ, the
   common denominator lies in the fact that unsuspecting users visit their
   sites. These visits can be driven by email, web search results or links
   from other web pages. In all cases, however, the user is required to
   take some action, such as clicking on a desired Uniform Resource Locator
   (URL). In order to identify these malicious sites, the web security
   community has developed blacklisting services. These blacklists are in
   turn constructed by an array of techniques including manual reporting,
   honeypots, and web crawlers combined with site analysis heuristics.
   Inevitably, many malicious sites are not blacklisted either because they
   are too recent or were never or incorrectly evaluated.
   In this paper, we address the detection of malicious URLs as a binary
   classification problem and study the performance of several well-known
   classifiers, namely Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Multi-Layer
   Perceptron, Decision Trees, Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbors.
   Furthermore, we adopted a public dataset comprising 2.4 million URLs
   (instances) and 3.2 million features. The numerical simulations have
   shown that most classification methods achieve acceptable prediction
   rates without requiring either advanced feature selection techniques or
   the involvement of a domain expert. In particular, Random Forest and
   Multi-Layer Perceptron attain the highest accuracy.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the secrecy performance of a full-duplex
   (FD) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) relay system under the
   presence of multiple non-colluding eavesdroppers over Rayleigh fading
   channels. Furthermore, to improve legitimate link's capacity, the
   partial relay selection (PRS) scheme is applied to choose the best
   relay. To evaluate the secrecy performance, we derive the closed-form
   expressions of the secure outage probability (SOP) of each user, the
   overall SOP and the sum effective secrecy throughput (EST) of the
   considered FD-NOMA relay system. We compare the SOP of the FD-NOMA relay
   system with that of the half-duplex (HD)-NOMA system and the SOPs of
   FD-NOMA relay system in the cases that PRS and multiple-relay (MR)
   schemes are employed at multiple relays. Monte-Carlo simulations verify
   the correctness of all derived mathematical expressions. Numerical
   results show that thanks to utilizing FD relays and PRS scheme, the
   considered FD-NOMA relay system has superior secrecy performance than
   other systems. Furthermore, increasing the number of FD relays,
   enhancing their self-interference cancellation capability, and selecting
   a suitable transmission power help to reduce the SOP of the considered
   FD-NOMA relay system. Meanwhile, the EST rapidly increases with the
   equivocation rate of the eavesdropping channel then gradually reaches
   the saturated maximum value.},

Abstract = {Increase in usage of electronic communication tools (email, IM, Skype,
   etc.) in enterprise environments has created new attack vectors for
   social engineers. Billions of people are now using electronic equipment
   in their everyday workflow which means billions of potential victims of
   Social Engineering (SE) attacks. Human is considered the weakest link in
   cybersecurity chain and breaking this defense is nowadays the most
   accessible route for malicious internal and external users. While
   several methods of protection have already been proposed and applied,
   none of these focuses on chat-based SE attacks while at the same time
   automation in the field is still missing. Social engineering is a
   complex phenomenon that requires interdisciplinary research combining
   technology, psychology, and linguistics. Attackers treat human
   personality traits as vulnerabilities and use the language as their
   weapon to deceive, persuade and finally manipulate the victims as they
   wish. Hence, a holistic approach is required to build a reliable SE
   attack recognition system. In this paper we present the current
   state-of-the-art on SE attack recognition systems, we dissect a SE
   attack to recognize the different stages, forms, and attributes and
   isolate the critical enablers that can influence a SE attack to work.
   Finally, we present our approach for an automated recognition system for
   chat-based SE attacks that is based on Personality Recognition,
   Influence Recognition, Deception Recognition, Speech Act and Chat
   History.},

Abstract = {Many infectious diseases originating from, or carried by, wildlife
   affect wildlife conservation and biodiversity, livestock health, or
   human health. We provide an update on changes in the epidemiology of 25
   selected infectious, wildlife-related diseases in Europe (from 2010-16)
   that had an impact, or may have a future impact, on the health of
   wildlife, livestock, and humans. These pathogens were selected based on
   their: 1) identification in recent Europe-wide projects as important
   surveillance targets, 2) inclusion in European Union legislation as
   pathogens requiring obligatory surveillance, 3) presence in recent
   literature on wildlife-related diseases in Europe since 2010, 4)
   inclusion in key pathogen lists released by the Office International des
   Epizooties, 5) identification in conference presentations and informal
   discussions on a group email list by a European network of wildlife
   disease scientists from the European Wildlife Disease Association, or 6)
   identification as pathogens with changes in their epidemiology during
   2010-16. The wildlife pathogens or diseases included in this review are:
   avian influenza virus, seal influenza virus, lagoviruses, rabies virus,
   bat lyssaviruses, filoviruses, canine distemper virus, morbilliviruses
   in aquatic mammals, bluetongue virus, West Nile virus, hantaviruses,
   Schmallenberg virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, African
   swine fever virus, amphibian ranavirus, hepatitis E virus, bovine
   tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis), tularemia (Francisella tularensis),
   brucellosis (Brucella spp.), salmonellosis (Salmonella spp.), Coxiella
   burnetii, chytridiomycosis, Echinococcus multilocularis, Leishmania
   infantum, and chronic wasting disease. Further work is needed to
   identify all of the key drivers of disease change and emergence, as they
   appear to be influencing the incidence and spread of these pathogens in
   Europe. We present a summary of these recent changes during 2010-16 to
   discuss possible commonalities and drivers of disease change and to
   identify directions for future work on wildlife-related diseases in
   Europe. Many of the pathogens are entering Europe from other continents
   while others are expanding their ranges inside and beyond Europe.
   Surveillance for these wildlife-related diseases at a continental scale
   is therefore important for planet-wide assessment, awareness of, and
   preparedness for the risks they may pose to wildlife, domestic animal,
   and human health.},

Title = {COVID-GAN plus : Estimating Human Mobility Responses to COVID-19 through
   Spatio-temporal Generative Adversarial Networks with Enhanced Features},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Estimating human mobility responses to the large-scale spreading of the
   COVID-19 pandemic is crucial, since its significance guides policymakers
   to give Non-pharmaceutical Interventions, such as closure or reopening
   of businesses. It is challenging to model due to complex social contexts
   and limited training data. Recently, we proposed a conditional
   generative adversarial network (COVID-GAN) to estimate human mobility
   response under a set of social and policy conditions integrated from
   multiple data sources. Although COVID-GAN achieves a good average
   estimation accuracy under real-world conditions, it produces higher
   errors in certain regions due to the presence of spatial heterogeneity
   and outliers. To address these issues, in this article, we extend our
   prior work by introducing a new spatio-temporal deep generative model,
   namely, COVID-GAN+. COVID-GAN+ deals with the spatial heterogeneity
   issue by introducing a new spatial feature layer that utilizes the local
   Moran statistic to model the spatial heterogeneity strength in the data.
   In addition, we redesign the training objective to learn the estimated
   mobility changes from historical average levels to mitigate the effects
   of spatial outliers. We perform comprehensive evaluations using urban
   mobility data derived from cell phone records and census data. Results
   show that COVID-GAN+ can better approximate real-world human mobility
   responses than prior methods, including COVID-GAN.},

Title = {An Assessment Study of Indian State Government Portals},
Booktitle = {E-GOVERNMENT WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT: FUTURE TRENDS AND STRATEGIC MODELS},
Year = {2011},
Pages = {130-152},
Abstract = {Does the e-readiness of a country or a state give any insight into the
   success of their e-government projects? Does scaling up of e-readiness
   help to measure the acceptance of e-government projects by citizens?
   Research has failed to provide a direct answer to these questions. While
   an e-readiness index summarizes the infrastructural condition of a state
   or country in terms of network readiness and availability of hardware
   facility; e-government readiness implies the acceptance of e-government
   projects by the citizens in a state or a country. So, the e-readiness
   index cannot clearly depict the e-government readiness of a country.
   Since e-government projects are broadly categorized as Government to
   Citizen, Government to Business and Government to Government, it becomes
   difficult to quantify the satisfaction level of the stakeholders. For
   analysing the acceptance of e-government business models particularly
   the web based ones, researchers (Yang, 2002; Kasubiene \& Vanagas, 2007;
   Janssen, Kuk \& Wagenaar, 2008; Morgeson \& Mithas, 2009) often adopted
   the quality criteria used in evaluating service offered by of e-commerce
   sites. The most pervasive concept of quality in use is the extent to
   which a web service meets and/ or exceeds a citizen's/customer's
   expectations. Portals at the Federal Government level in India were
   developed with the idea to form a `single window' access to the
   facilities provided by the states or union territories to the citizens
   in an integrated platform. The idea behind such investment on state wise
   portals was to serve the citizens better but there was hardly any
   attempt from the government side to assess the acceptance of the
   portals. Some of the portals have counters to keep a track of visitors
   and email facilities have been provided to serve queries of the
   visitors. So the effectiveness of the portals has become a questionable
   issue today. In this study we have tried to concentrate on Indian State
   government portals and assess the service quality provided by them. It
   was observed that State wise Service Quality issues in e-government
   differ significantly when global parameters like usability, adequacy of
   information, navigation facility interactivity are considered. So, to
   evaluate the portals a conceptual framework based on previous research
   works was proposed. Quality dimensions were identified to assess service
   quality of government portals and each of the state and the union
   territory portal was audited based on the parameters proposed like
   usefulness of information, adequacy of information, citizen centric
   information, usability, accessibility, interaction, privacy, security
   and citizen participation.},

Abstract = {The goal is to survey big data techniques applications to financial
   crime prevention and detection in more than two decades. Also, to
   determine the industrial sector of financial crime that has gathered the
   most interest and which fields still lack research. The study describes
   the most common methods for detecting financial crime, indicating some
   of the current research problems, trends, and issues in big data
   application. Meanwhile, the survey focuses on financial crime detection
   techniques applied in several sectors such as banks, computer networks,
   insurance, securities, exchange commodities, stock markets and money
   laundering. The methods considered in the survey include; big data
   analytics foundational technologies and big data analytics emerging
   research. In most of the data-collection strategies and data analysis,
   there was a shift from traditional data collection method to
   computer-based methods. In the aspect of data analysis, there was an
   increase in the use of descriptive, inferential statistical analysis. We
   made an evaluation of the detecting techniques based on data analysis
   factors such as processing speed, latency, volume, performance, fault
   tolerance, scalability, and accuracy. Then we propose that anomaly,
   data-mining, clustering, hybrid-technologies, neural networks, rough
   clustering, k-Means clustering, neuro-fuzzy, genetic algorithms and
   fuzzy support vector machine models are performing better than other
   methods currently in practice. However, more research is required in big
   data infrastructures like hardware equipment, software licensing, and
   maintenance which are still very expensive. Likewise, further research
   is needed in the human analysis of big data approaches to financial
   crime detection because of the challenges of sorting out information.},

Title = {Development of 10 principles of radiation protection in oral and

Journal = {IMAGING SCIENCE IN DENTISTRY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 MAY 9},
Abstract = {Purpose: This study aimed to establish an expert consensus on a set of
   principles for radiation protection in oral and maxillofacial radiology
   in Korea. Although national and international guidelines exist, their
   practical application to dental radiology remains limited, with key
   clinical components not mandatorily enforced. Therefore, guidelines
   tailored specifically to dental radiology are necessary to ensure
   consistent and effective radiation safety. Materials and Methods: A
   modified Delphi method was utilized, involving 20 experts-7 specialists
   in oral and maxillofacial radiology and 13 in medical radiology. A
   Guideline Development Committee initially drafted the principles, which
   were refined over 3 rounds of email-based surveys. Panelists evaluated
   each principle using a 9-point Likert scale, with quantitative scores
   and qualitative feedback informing the revision process. Results:
   Consensus was reached on 10 principles, addressing radiographic
   justification, imaging scope limitations, pregnancy considerations,
   pediatric optimization, portable radiography, radiation dose monitoring
   and equipment operation. Final agreement scores approached 9.0, with
   standard deviations <= 0.7, confirming strong expert consensus.
   Conclusion: The finalized principles constitute a structured,
   evidence-based guideline aligned with international standards while
   addressing specific challenges unique to oral and maxillofacial
   radiology. They offer practical strategies to enhance patient safety and
   standardize radiographic decision-making. Further research should
   investigate their clinical implementation and recommend periodic updates
   to reflect evolving technologies.},

Abstract = {Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects 2.1\% of the Australian
   population (1.5\% males; 2.6\% females), with the highest prevalence
   from ages 55 to over 75 years (4.4-6.1\%). In Canada, RA affects
   approximately 0.9\% of adults, and within 30 years that is expected to
   increase to 1.3\%. With an aging population and a greater number of
   individuals with modifiable risk factors for chronic diseases, such as
   arthritis, there is an urgent need for co-care management of arthritic
   conditions. The increasing trend and present shifts in the health
   services and policy sectors suggest that digital information delivery is
   becoming more prominent. Therefore, it is necessary to further
   investigate the use of online resources for RA information delivery.
   Objective: The objective is to examine the effect of implementing an
   online program provided to patients with RA, the People Getting a Grip
   on Arthritis for RA (PGrip-RA) program, using information communication
   technologies (ie, Facebook and emails) in combination with arthritis
   health care professional support and electronic educational pamphlets.
   We believe this can serve as a useful and economical method of knowledge
   translation (KT).
   Methods: This KT randomized controlled trial will use a prospective
   randomized open-label blinded-endpoint design to compare four different
   intervention approaches of the PGrip-RA program to a control group
   receiving general electronic educational pamphlets self-management in RA
   via email. Depending on group allocation, links to the Arthritis Society
   PGrip-RA material will be provided either through Facebook or by email.
   One group will receive feedback online from trained health care
   professionals. The intervention period is 6 weeks. Participants will
   have access to the Internet-based material after the completion of the
   baseline questionnaires until the final follow-up questionnaire at 6
   months. We will invite 396 patients from Canadian and Australian
   Arthritis Consumers' Associations to participate using online
   recruitment.
   Results: This study will build on a pilot study using Facebook, which
   revealed promising effects of knowledge acquisition/integration of the
   evidence-based self-management PGrip educational program.
   Conclusions: The use of online techniques to disseminate knowledge
   provides an opportunity to reduce health care costs by facilitating
   self-management of people with arthritis. Study design strengths include
   the incorporation of randomization and allocation concealment to ensure
   internal validity. To avoid intergroup contamination, the Facebook group
   page security settings will be set to ``closed{''}, thus allowing only
   invited participants to access it. Study limitations include the lack of
   participant blinding due to the characteristics of this KT randomized
   controlled trial and a potential bias of recruiting patients only
   online, though this was proven effective in the previous pilot study.},

Abstract = {Objective. Nursing workplace injuries related to staff-assisted
   patient/resident movement occur frequently, however, little is known
   about the programs that aim to prevent these injuries. The objectives of
   this study were to: (i) describe how Australian hospitals and
   residential aged care services provide manual handling training to staff
   and the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on
   training; (ii) report issues relating to manual handling; (iii) explore
   the inclusion of dynamic risk assessment; and (iv) describe the barriers
   and potential improvements.Method. Using a cross-sectional design, an
   online 20-min survey was distributed by email, social media, and
   snowballing to Australian hospitals and residential aged care
   services.Results. Respondents were from 75 services across Australia,
   with a combined 73 000 staff who assist patients/residents to mobilise.
   Most services provide staff manual handling training on commencement
   (85\%; n = 63/74), then annually (88\% n = 65/74). Since the COVID-19
   pandemic, training was less frequent, shorter in duration, and with
   greater online content. Respondents reported issues with staff injuries
   (63\% n = 41), patient/resident falls (52\% n = 34), and
   patient/resident inactivity (69\% n = 45). Dynamic risk assessment was
   missing in part or in whole from most programs (92\% n = 67/73), despite
   a belief that this may reduce staff injuries (93\% n = 68/73),
   patient/resident falls (81\% n = 59/73) and inactivity (92\% n = 67/73).
   Barriers included insufficient staff and time, and improvements included
   giving residents a say in how they move and greater access to allied
   health.Conclusion. Most Australian health and aged care services provide
   clinical staff with regular manual handling training for staff-assisted
   patient/resident movement, however, issues with staff injuries, as well
   as patient/resident falls and inactivity, remain. While there was a
   belief that dynamic in-the-moment risk assessment during staff-assisted
   patient/resident movement may improve staff and resident/patient safety,
   it was missing from most manual handling programs.},

Abstract = {Background: Significant adverse events (AE) during cancer therapy
   disrupt treatment and escalate to emergency admissions. Approaches to
   improve the timeliness and accuracy of AE reporting may improve safety
   and reduce health service costs. Reporting AE via patient reported
   outcomes (PROs), can improve clinician-patient communication and making
   data available to clinicians in `real-time' using electronic PROs
   (ePROs) could potentially transform clinical practice by providing
   easily accessible records to guide treatment decisions. This manuscript
   describes the development of eRAPID (electronic patient self-Reporting
   of Adverse-events: Patient Information and aDvice) is a National
   Institute for Health Research-funded programme, a system for patients to
   self-report and manage AE online during and after cancer treatment.
   Materials and methods: A multidisciplinary team of IT experts, staff and
   patients developed using agile principles a secure web application
   interface (QStore) between an existing online questionnaire builder
   (QTool) displaying real-time ePRO data to clinicians in the electronic
   patient record at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. Hierarchical
   algorithms were developed corresponding to Common Terminology Criteria
   for Adverse Events grading using the QTool question dependency function.
   Patient advocates (N = 9), patients (N = 13), and staff (N = 19)
   usability tested the system reporting combinations of AE.
   Results: The eRAPID system allows patients to report AE from home on PC,
   tablet or any web enabled device securely during treatment. The system
   generates immediate self-management advice for low or moderate AE and
   for severe AE advice to contact the hospital immediately. Clinicians can
   view patient AE data in the electronic patient record and receive email
   notifications when patients report severe AE.
   Conclusions: Evaluation of the system in a randomised controlled trial
   in breast, gynaecological and colorectal cancer patients undergoing
   systemic therapy is currently underway. To adapt eRAPID for different
   treatment groups, pilot studies are being undertaken with patients
   receiving pelvic radiotherapy and upper gastrointestinal surgery.},

Title = {How to ask: Surveying nursing directors of nursing homes},
Journal = {HEALTH SCIENCE REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background and Aims Nursing home research may involve eliciting
   information from managers, yet response rates for Directors of Nursing
   have not been recently studied. As a part of a more extensive study, we
   surveyed all nursing homes in three states in 2018 and 2019, updating
   how to survey these leaders effectively. We focus on response rates as a
   measure of non-response error and comparison of nursing home's
   characteristics to their population values as a measure of
   representation error. Methods We surveyed Directors of Nursing or their
   designees in nursing homes serving adult residents with at least 30 beds
   in California, Massachusetts, and Ohio (N = 2389). We collected contact
   information for respondents and then emailed survey invitations and
   links, followed by three email reminders and a paper version. Nursing
   home associations in two of the states contacted their members on our
   behalf. We compared the response rates across waves and states. We also
   compared the characteristics of nursing homes based on whether the
   response was via email or paper. In a multivariable logit regression, we
   used characteristics of the survey and the nursing homes to predict
   whether their DON responded to the survey using adjustments for multiple
   comparisons. Results The response rate was higher for the first wave
   than for the second (30\% vs 20.5\%). The highest response rate was in
   Massachusetts (31.8\%), followed by Ohio (25.8\%) and California
   (19.5\%). Nursing home characteristics did not vary by response mode.
   Additionally, we did not find any statistically significant predictors
   of whether a nursing home responded. Conclusion A single-mode survey may
   provide a reasonably representative sample at the cost of sample size.
   With that said, however, switching modes can increase sample size
   without potentially biasing the sample.},

Title = {Phishing Attack Detection Using Deep Learning},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a technique for detecting a significant threat that
   attempts to get sensitive and confidential information such as
   usernames, passwords, credit card information, and more to target an
   individual or organization. By definition, a phishing attack happens
   when malicious people pose as trusted entities to fraudulently obtain
   user data. Phishing is classified as a type of social engineering
   attack. For a phishing attack to happen, a victim must be convinced to
   open an email or a direct message {[}1]. The email or direct message
   will contain a link that the victim will be required to click on. The
   aim of the attack is usually to install malicious software or to freeze
   a system. In other instances, the attackers will threaten to reveal
   sensitive information obtained from the victim. Phishing attacks can
   have devastating effects on the victim. Sensitive and confidential
   information can find its way into the hands of malicious people. Another
   devastating effect of phishing attacks is identity theft {[}1].
   Attackers may impersonate the victim to make unauthorized purchases.
   Victims also complain of loss of funds when attackers access their
   credit card information. The proposed method has two major subsystems:
   (1) Data collection: different websites have been collected as a big
   data corresponding to normal and phishing dataset, and (2) distributed
   detection system: different artificial algorithms are used: a neural
   network algorithm and machine learning. The Amazon cloud was used for
   running the cluster with different cores of machines. The experiment
   results of the proposed system achieved very good accuracy and detection
   rate as well.},

Title = {Student and clinician perceptions of medical student mistreatment: a
   cross-sectional vignette survey},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objectives The mistreatment of medical students remains pervasive in
   medical education. Understanding the extent to which clinicians and
   students recognise mistreatment can assist in creating targeted
   interventions that reduce mistreatment. The objective of this study was
   to use clinical vignettes to assess perceptions of medical student
   mistreatment among medical students and clinical faculty at an
   Australian university. Design, setting and participants This
   cross-sectional study used a survey of medical students and clinical
   faculty in a Doctor of Medicine (MD) programme at Macquarie University
   in Sydney, Australia. Data were collected via an online survey between
   13 July and 27 July 2020. Outcome measures Fourteen clinical vignettes
   were developed based on commonly reported themes of mistreatment. An
   additional control vignette was also included, and these 15 vignettes
   were distributed via email to all 169 MD students and 42 teaching
   faculty at this teaching site. Participants were asked to rate whether
   the vignettes portrayed mistreatment on a 5-point Likert scale (strongly
   disagree to strongly agree). Results Respondents included 83 MD students
   and 34 clinical faculty. On average, students perceived mistreatment in
   9 of 14 vignettes and faculty in 8 of 14 vignettes. Faculty and student
   perceptions aligned in themes of sexual abuse, physical abuse and in the
   control vignette depicting a constructive teaching style. Perceptions
   differed significantly between faculty and students (p<0.05) for five
   vignettes across the themes of gender discrimination, requests of
   students to perform non-educational tasks, humiliation, specialty choice
   discrimination and requests to perform a task beyond the student's
   capacity. Conclusion Agreement on what constitutes appropriate behaviour
   is crucial to ensuring that a culture of mistreatment can be replaced
   with one of kindness, equity and respect. This study demonstrated the
   successful use of vignettes to compare perceptions of mistreatment, with
   faculty and student perceptions differing across a variety of themes.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Errors involving the prescription of medications are
   frequent in the health area, causing adverse events in hospitalized
   patients and economic losses in the productive process. The verification
   of the prescriptions, which must be elaborated in a complete and legible
   way, is of great importance in surveillance and prevention of errors.
   Objective: The objective of this work was to analyze the results of the
   implementation of two computational programs, Microsoft Excel for MAC
   version 15.27 for the preparation of electronic prescription, made
   available to the prescriber physician, and the Enterprise Resource
   Planning, for error alerts on the production line of parenteral
   nutritions, in the period 2006 to 2015. Method: The method used was
   based on a case study, conducted through a longitudinal survey of
   primary data, of an exploratory and descriptive nature, with participant
   observation in the implementation of software in a specialize
   Compounding Center. Results: In the year 2015, 39.5\% of the
   prescriptions were sent through fax or email. However, such
   prescriptions received a number of Occurrences of Potential Errors (OPE)
   of 97.9\%. Conclusions: The software of production proved to be an
   important tool of quality, especially in the production of PN for
   newborns, since it was identified the prevalence of alerts of
   prescription errors, in the proportion of 1.7 alerts for each elaborated
   prescription.},

Abstract = {Mobile devices have revolutionized many aspects of our lives. We use
   smartphones and tablets as portable computers and, often without
   realizing it, we run various types of security-sensitive programs on
   them, such as personal and enterprise email and instant-messaging
   applications, as well as social, banking, insurance and retail programs.
   These applications access and transmit over the network numerous pieces
   of private information, including our geographical location, device ID,
   contacts, calendar events, passwords, and health records, as well as
   credit-card, social-security, and bank-account numbers. Guaranteeing
   that no private information is exposed to unauthorized observers is very
   challenging given the level of complexity that these applications have
   reached. Furthermore, using program-analysis tools with out-of-the-box
   configurations in order to detect confidentiality violations may not
   yield the desired results because only a few pieces of private data,
   such as the device's ID and geographical location, are obtained from
   standard sources. The majority of confidentiality sources (such as
   credit-card and bank-account numbers) are application-specific and
   require careful configuration.
   This paper presents Labyrinth, a run-time privacy enforcement system
   that automatically detects leakage of private data originating from
   standard as well as application-specific sources. Labyrinth features
   several novel contributions: (i) it allows for visually configuring,
   directly atop the application's User Interface (UI), the fields that
   constitute custom sources of private data; (ii) it does not require
   operating-system instrumentation, but relies only an application-level
   instrumentation and on a proxy that intercepts the communication between
   the mobile device and the back-end servers; and (iii) it performs an
   enhanced form of value-similarity analysis to detect data leakage even
   when sensitive data (such as a password) has been encoded or hashed.
   Labyrinth supports both Android and iOS. We have evaluated Labyrinth
   experimentally, and in this paper we report results on production-level
   applications.},

Title = {Prevalence and Risk Profile Of Unread Messages To Patients In A Patient
   Web Portal},
Journal = {APPLIED CLINICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {375-382},
Abstract = {Background: Excitement around the adoption of electronic communication
   between physicians and patients is tempered by the possibility of
   increased clinical and legal risk. If patients do not read messages in a
   timely fashion, duplicative communication efforts may be required and
   patient safety may be jeopardized.
   Objective: We sought to assess the prevalence and risk profile of unread
   messages in a mature patient portal.
   Methods: We analyzed six years of messages (2005-2010) from physicians
   to patients to determine the prevalence and associated characteristics
   of unread messages in a patient portal. We focused on clinical messages,
   and excluded announcements. Because some physicians sent clinical
   messages to groups of patients, we labeled messages sent to more than 5
   patients as ``outreach{''} messages and excluded them from general
   analyses. We performed a chart review of 75 clinical messages to assess
   for harm.
   Results: We found that 3\% of clinical messages were unread after 21
   days. Messages arriving outside of business hours were slightly more
   likely to go unread (RR 1.15 95\% CI 1.11-1.19). Patients who were male
   (OR 1.14 CI 1.04-1.26) African American (OR 1.69 CI 1.29-2.22) or
   Hispanic (OR 1.74 CI 1.17-2.59), or in the lowest income group (OR 1.72
   CI 1.19-2.49) were more likely to have unread messages. Chart review
   showed no evidence of harm, but 13\% of sampled unread messages were
   associated with potential delays in care. Incidentally, we found 50\% of
   the physician-initiated outreach messages were unread.
   Conclusions: Overall, secure messaging appears a safe form of
   communication, but systems to notify senders when messages are unread
   may have value. While most clinical messages were read, many outreach
   messages were not, providing caution for relying on such systems for
   information dissemination. Similar to other studies, differences by race
   and income were observed and require further study.},

   flexible and more fine-grained verifiability of proofs than standard
   NIZK that supports public verifiability and designated-verifier NIZK
   (DV-NIZK) that supports private verifiability. FV-NIZK has two
   statistically equivalent verification approaches:
   a master verification using the master secret key msk;
   a fine-grained verification using a derived secret key skd, which is
   derived from msk w.r.t. d (which may stand for user identity, email
   address, vector, etc.).
   We require unbounded simulation soundness (USS) of FV-NIZK to hold, even
   if an adversary obtains derived secret keys skd with d of its choices,
   and define proof pseudorandomness which stipulates the pseudorandomness
   of proofs for adversaries that are not given any secret key.
   We present two instantiations of FV-NIZK for linear subspace languages,
   based on the matrix decisional Diffie-Hellman (MDDH) assumption. One of
   the FV-NIZK instantiations is pairing-free and achieves almost tight USS
   and proof pseudorandomness.
   We illustrate the usefulness of FV-NIZK by showing two applications and
   obtain the following pairing-free schemes:
   the first almost tightly multi-challenge CCA (mCCA)-secure innerproduct
   functional encryption (IPFE) scheme without pairings;
   the first public-key encryption (PKE) scheme that reconciles the
   inherent contradictions between public verifiability and anonymity. We
   formalize such PKE as Fine-grained Verifiable PKE (FV-PKE), which
   derives a special key from the decryption secret key, such that for
   those who obtain the derived key, they can check the validity of
   ciphertexts but the anonymity is lost from their views (CCA-security
   still holds for them), while for others who do not get the derived key,
   they cannot do the validity check but the anonymity holds for them. Our
   FV-PKE scheme achieves almost tight mCCA-security for adversaries who
   obtain the derived keys, and achieves almost tight ciphertext
   pseudorandomness (thus anonymity) for others who do not get any derived
   key.},

Abstract = {Objectives The objectives of this study were to estimate the prevalence
   of cell phone and computer use among urban families bringing their
   children to an emergency department and to determine which technologies
   parents prefer to use to receive health information. Methods We visited
   2 pediatric emergency departments in Baltimore, Md, and Little Rock,
   Ark. A convenience sample of parents of children 8 years old or younger
   completed a self-administered survey in the waiting area. Results Two
   hundred thirty-eight surveys were completed. Respondents were primarily
   female (83\%), less than 35 years old (74\%), and had at least a high
   school diploma or General Educational Development (94\%). Forty-three
   percent were employed full time. A majority (95\%) of respondents
   reported owning a cell phone, with most (88\%) owning a smartphone and
   96\% reported having some internet access. Of cell phone owners, 91\%
   reported daily text messaging activity. Over half (63\%) of respondents
   reported having computer internet access at home; 31\% reported having
   internet access at work. Patterns of behavior and preferences emerged
   for both cell phone and computer use. Respondents were more likely to
   check their email (75\% vs 50\%, P < 0.0001) and access the internet
   (78\% vs 67\%, P = 0.002) with a smartphone rather than their computer.
   Conclusions Both cell phones and computers are prevalent and used among
   urban families seen in pediatric emergency departments, offering new
   ways to deliver health information to these often underserved
   populations. Providers aiming to deliver health information should
   consider smartphone applications, text message-based programs, and email
   to communicate with their patients.},

Abstract = {Geographically distributed infrastructures, such as buildings, dams, and
   solar power plants, are commonly maintained via Internet-connected
   remote management devices. Previous studies on detecting and securing
   industrial control systems (ICS) have overlooked these remote management
   devices, as they do not expose ICS-specific services like Modbus and
   BACnet and thus do not show up in Internet-wide scans for such services.
   In this paper, we implement and validate a discovery method for these
   devices via their Web User Interface (WebUI) and detect 890 devices in
   Japan alone. We also show that many of these devices are highly
   insecure. Many allow access to the status or even the control over
   industrial systems without proper authentication. Taking a closer look
   at three prevalent remote management devices, we discovered 13 0-day
   vulnerabilities, several of which were rated as medium or high severity.
   They have been responsibly disclosed to the manufacturers. By using
   honeypots that imitate these systems, we show that over time, only a
   small number of attackers enter these systems, but some do change
   critical parameters. Attackers appear to interact more with the system
   when more facility information is displayed on the WebUI. Finally, we
   notified operators of 317 vulnerable remote management devices by email
   and telephone. We reached 212 persons in charge of the devices and
   received confirmation that our method had correctly identified the
   device. 50\% of the persons in charge of the devices stated that they
   mitigated or will mitigate the problem. We confirmed their actions via a
   followup scan for vulnerable devices and found that measures were taken
   for 58\% of the devices when we could reach the persons in charge of the
   device.},

Abstract = {Information retrieval is the method of retrieving the knowledge relevant
   to an issue of curiosity. It locates the relevant documents, on the
   premise of user's question which includes keywords or example files.
   Probably the most acquainted application of information retrieval system
   is search engine corresponding to Web search, Desktop search, Federated
   search, Mobile search, Enterprise search and Social search. This
   research work mainly focused on the desktop search. Desktop search is
   the specified variant of enterprise search, where the information
   foundations are the files stored on a personal computer, together with
   email and websites established on content analysis. Content Analysis is
   a group of manual or computer based approaches for contextualized
   explanations of documents. To analyze the content the different text
   pattern matching algorithms are used and it is used to discover all the
   existences of a limited set of patterns inside an input document.
   Commonly these algorithms are used in several applications that include
   information security bio-informatics, plagiarism detection, text mining
   and document matching. String matching is essential for finding text
   patterns that are in online and offline. String matching algorithm is
   used to matches the pattern precisely or about in the input document.
   The main objective of this research work is to analyze the performance
   of existing string matching algorithms. For this comparison there are
   four algorithms are used namely, Two way algorithm, Colussi algorithm,
   Optimal mismatch algorithm and Maximal shift algorithm. From this
   analysis it is observed that the Colussi string matching algorithm gives
   the better result.},

Abstract = {Big data are grooming in reality. SQL does not have capacity to handle a
   very huge amount of data. All applications are now working in view to a
   vast volume of data Data is increasing massively in majority of stream
   of jobs , let it be employee details or health records. So the
   applications being used to handle these type of data should be modified
   too. Not only the applications but the databases and warehouses where we
   store these data have to be modifies too. SQL can store data in
   different tables and databases but later it is very difficult task to
   retrieve the same as that will include loads of join operation and very
   multifaceted transactions. So in this paper we propose to build an
   application for hospital management and to handle patient health records
   . Our application uses a NoSQL database(i.e here we use mongodb) for
   storing and retrieving the data. We are implementing Mongo lab in our
   application deployment. Each record and its associated data will be
   stored in a sole document thus simplifies the data access. Here, unlike
   SQL databases, the documents stored are schema free and similar to each
   other, this is a big advantage of NoSQL and helps in modelling
   unstructured data. We also use the tokenization concept to ensure
   security. We convert the user credentials like name, password, phone no,
   email id etc. into ASCII values and store it in separate mongo db. The
   patients medical history, lab reports, medicine prescription etc. will
   be stored in a separate Mongo db.},

Abstract = {Motion sickness is a common problem when travelling in a moving vehicle,
   especially on land transportation. This occurrence would signify when
   users are exposed to unexpected movement in an obstructed view. Each
   user can experience a different level of motion sickness, depending on
   their susceptibility. This paper aims to study the motion sickness
   susceptibility among Malaysians using Motion Sickness Susceptibility
   Questionnaires (MSSQ-Short). A total of 252 Malaysians (146 males and
   106 females) completed a set of questionnaires. The questionnaire was
   distributed through electronic means such as Facebook, WhatsApp,
   Twitter, and email and consisted of demographic, MSSQ-Short, travel
   experience as a driver and passenger, and seating position. This study
   provides a correlation between experiencing motion sickness between
   childhood and adulthood (r = 0.124, p < 0.05) for the Malaysian sample.
   This study concludes that Malaysian susceptibility is higher compared to
   other countries.},

Abstract = {The growing volume and variety of data presents both opportunities and
   challenges for visual analytics. Addressing these challenges is needed
   for big data to provide valuable insights and novel solutions for
   business, security, social media, and healthcare. In the case of
   temporal event sequence analytics it is the number of events in the data
   and variety of temporal sequence patterns that challenges users of
   visual analytic tools. This paper describes 15 strategies for sharpening
   analytic focus that analysts can use to reduce the data volume and
   pattern variety. Four groups of strategies are proposed: (1) extraction
   strategies, (2) temporal folding, (3) pattern simplification strategies,
   and (4) iterative strategies. For each strategy, we provide examples of
   the use and impact of this strategy on volume and/or variety. Examples
   are selected from 20 case studies gathered from either our own work, the
   literature, or based on email interviews with individuals who conducted
   the analyses and developers who observed analysts using the tools.
   Finally, we discuss how these strategies might be combined and report on
   the feedback from 10 senior event sequence analysts.},

Title = {Barriers to Clinician Reporting to the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry

Abstract = {Background Excluding pregnant women with human immunodeficiency virus
   (HIV) from clinical trials results in inadequate pregnancy safety data
   for new antiretroviral therapies (ART). More rapid accumulation of ART
   pregnancy safety data is required. The Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry
   (APR) collects teratogenicity data on ART exposures during conception
   and pregnancy, yet reporting to the registry is suboptimal, impacting
   ART choices for women with HIV globally. This research assesses
   awareness of the APR and barriers to reporting among HIV providers in
   the United States (US) and Australia.Methods Anonymous, online surveys
   were conceived independently by researchers in the US and Australia. The
   surveys were distributed through national email distribution lists to
   healthcare providers for pregnant women with HIV and their newborns or
   women of reproductive potential with HIV, to assess their awareness of
   the APR and barriers to reporting.Results In total, 146 healthcare
   providers (66 US, 80 Australia) completed the survey. Respondents from
   the US had greater awareness of the registry and more reporting
   experience, describing the process as complex and laborious. Providers
   from Australia were largely unaware that the APR accepts reports from
   outside the US. Key barriers to reporting were uncertainty about how to
   report and incomplete access to all relevant maternal and pediatric
   data.Conclusions Barriers to reporting to the APR are context specific.
   There is scope to raise the global profile of the APR to expedite data
   collection, reducing time between antiretroviral licensure and
   accumulation of sufficient pregnancy safety data.
   Increasing reporting to the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry will
   facilitate accumulation of pregnancy safety data of newer
   antiretrovirals faster than is currently occurring. This study assesses
   awareness and barriers to reporting among HIV providers in the United
   States and Australia.},

Title = {Care-pathways for patients presenting to emergency ambulance services
   with self-harm: national survey},
Journal = {EMERGENCY MEDICINE JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {37},
Number = {12},
Pages = {752-755},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background Self-harm is among the top five causes of acute hospital
   admissions and ambulance clinicians are often the first point of
   contact. However, the Emergency Department (ED) may not be the most
   appropriate place of care and little is known about the existence or
   nature of alternative pathways available to UK ambulance services. This
   survey describes the current management pathways used by ambulance
   services for patients who have self-harmed.
   Methods A structured questionnaire was sent to all UK ambulance services
   by email and followed up by telephone in 2018. Three independent
   researchers (two clinical) coded responses which were analysed
   thematically.
   Results All 13 UK ambulance services responded to the survey: nine by
   email and four by telephone interview. Two services reported a
   service-wide protocol for managing people presenting with self-harm,
   with referral to mental health crisis team available as an alternative
   to conveyance to ED, following on-scene psychosocial assessment. Four
   services reported local pathways for managing mental health patients
   which included care of patients who had self-harmed. Four services
   reported being in the process of developing pathways for managing mental
   health patients. Six services reported no service-wide nor local
   pathways for managing self-harm patients. No robust evaluation of new
   care models was reported.
   Conclusion Practice in ambulance services in the UK is variable, with a
   minority having a specific clinical pathway for managing self-harm, with
   an option to avoid ED. New pathways for patients who have self-harmed
   must be evaluated in terms of safety, clinical and cost-effectiveness.},

Abstract = {Bloom filters and their variants are widely used as space-efficient
   probabilistic data structures for representing sets and are very popular
   in networking applications. They support fast element insertion and
   deletion, along with membership queries with the drawback of false
   positives. Bloom filters can be designed to match the false positive
   rates that are acceptable for the application domain. However, in many
   applications, a common engineering solution is to set the false positive
   rate very small and ignore the existence of the very unlikely false
   positive answers. This article is devoted to close the gap between the
   two design concepts of unlikely and not having false positives. We
   propose a data structure called EGH filter that supports the Bloom
   filter operations, and besides, it can guarantee false positive free
   operations for a finite universe and a restricted number of elements
   stored in the filter. We refer to the limited universe and filter size
   as the false positive free zone of the filter. We describe necessary
   conditions for the false-positive free zone of a filter. We then
   generalize the filter to support the listing of the elements through the
   use of counters rather than bits. We detail networking applications of
   the filter and discuss potential generalizations. We evaluate the
   performance of the filter in comparison with the traditional Bloom
   filters. We also evaluate the price in terms of memory that needs to be
   paid to guarantee real false positive-free operations for having a
   deterministic Bloom filter-like behavior. Our data structure is based on
   recently developed combinatorial group testing techniques.},

Abstract = {It is well known that either domain specific or domain independent
   knowledge has been adopted in Information Retrieval (IR) to improve the
   retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose a novel IR model for
   digital forensics by using Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and WordNet as
   an underlying reference ontology to retrieve suspicious emails according
   to the semantic meaning of an investigator's query. Our model
   incorporates corpus independent knowledge from WordNet and corpus
   dependent knowledge from LSI into query expansion and reduction; and LSI
   is also adopted to simulate human meaning-based judgement of relatedness
   between investigator's queries and emails. We compare the performance of
   the resulting LSI And WordNet based Information Retrieval System
   (LAWIRS) with other three systems we implement, i.e. the LSI system, the
   Lucene system and the Lucene system with query expansion. Experimental
   results on several email datasets demonstrate that for short Boolean
   queries, LAWIRS can successfully capture their meaning and yield
   substantial improvements in the overall retrieval performance.},

Title = {TUNING VISCOELASTICITY WITH MINOR CHANGES IN SPEED OF SOUND IN AN
   ULTRASOUND PHANTOM MATERIAL},

Abstract = {The acoustic properties of ultrasound phantom materials have always been
   important, but with new applications interrogating tissue mechanical
   properties, viscoelasticity has also become an interesting feature to
   consider. Along with Young's modulus, the viscous component of tissue is
   affected by certain diseases and can therefore be used as a biomarker.
   Furthermore, viscoelasticity varies between tissue types and
   individuals, and therefore it would be useful with a phantom material
   that reflects this physiological range. Here we describe a gel for
   ultrasound imaging with a range of mechanical properties given by mixing
   different ratios of two oil-based gels, clear ballistic and styrene-
   ethylene/butylene-styrene (SEBS). The gels were mixed in five different
   proportions, ranging from 0- 100\% of either gel. For each of the gel
   compositions, we measured time of flight to determine speed of sound,
   narrowband ultrasound transmission for attenuation, stress-relaxation
   for viscoelasticity, mass and volume. Analysis of the stress-relaxation
   data using the generalized Maxwell model suggests that the material can
   be described by five parameters, E-0, E-1, E-2, eta(1) and eta(2), and
   that each of these parameters decreases as more SEBS is incorporated
   into the mixed material. Instantaneous Young's modulus (the sum of E-0,
   E-1 and E-2 in our model) ranges between 49 and 117 kPa for the
   different ratios, similar to values reported for cancerous tissue.
   Despite the large span of obtainable mechanical properties, speed of
   sound is relatively constant regardless of composition, with mean value
   estimates (+/- 95 \% CI) between 1438 +/- 9 and 1455 +/- 3 m/s for pure
   and mixed gels. This was attributed to a variation in density and
   Poisson's ratio, following from the relation linking them to speed of
   sound and elasticity. Furthermore, both speed of sound and attenuation
   were within a suitable range for ultrasound phantoms. Combining this
   ballistic gel with SEBS copolymer in oil allows for control of
   mechanical properties, both elastic and viscous as evaluated by the
   material model. Furthermore, it does so without compromising ease of
   use, longevity and safety of the pre-made gel. (Email:

Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Objective: With regard to changes in the German law of preventive
   detention - a sentence handed down to offenders who committed a grave
   offence and are considered a danger to public safety, similar to the
   preventive detention law in New Zealand an online survey amongst
   forensic psychiatrists has been conducted between July and October 2011.
   Questions have been raised regarding the necessity of preventive
   detention, subsequent preventive detention (the possibility of imposing
   ``preventive detention{''} after sentencing, which was ruled a violation
   of the European Convention of Human Rights by the European Court of
   Human Rights), and the Therapy Placement Act from January 1St, 2011.
   Methods: Participants have been contacted via email and participation
   was anonymous. An online-platform has been established, and has been
   open for about four months.
   Results: Most participants have been familiar with either court reports
   regarding preventive detention or the content of the Therapy Placement
   Act. Less than one third had already answered issues considering this
   new law. All participants have considered preventive detention as
   necessary, but subsequent preventive detention as well as the Therapy
   Placement Act as not required.
   Conclusions: The Therapy Placement Act was considered to be modified by
   involving an interdisciplinary advisory board. Terms of ``psychiatric
   disorder{''} should be defined or replaced, and frequency of psychiatric
   assessment should be reduced.},

Abstract = {We present an empirical and large-scale analysis of malware samples
   captured from two different enterprises from 2017 to early 2018.
   Particularly, we perform threat vector, social-engineering,
   vulnerability and time-series analysis on our dataset. Unlike existing
   malware studies, our analysis is specifically focused on the recent
   enterprise malware samples. First of all, based on our analysis on the
   combined datasets of two enterprises, our results confirm the general
   consensus that AV-only solutions are not enough for real-time defenses
   in enterprise settings because on average 40\% of the malware samples,
   when first appeared, are not detected by most AVs on VirusTotal or not
   uploaded to VT at all (i.e., never seen in the wild yet). Moreover, our
   analysis also shows that enterprise users transfer documents more than
   executables and other types of files. Therefore, attackers embed
   malicious codes into documents to download and install the actual
   malicious payload instead of sending malicious payload directly or using
   vulnerability exploits. Moreover, we also found that financial matters
   (e.g., purchase orders and invoices) are still the most common subject
   seen in Business Email Compromise (BEC) scams that aim to trick
   employees. Finally, based on our analysis on the timestamps of captured
   malware samples, we found that 93\% of the malware samples were
   delivered on weekdays. Our further analysis also showed that while the
   malware samples that require user interaction such as macro-based
   malware samples have been captured during the working hours of the
   employees, the massive malware attacks are triggered during the
   off-times of the employees to be able to silently spread over the
   networks.},

Abstract = {Purpose Previous studies suggest that within radiation oncology, medical
   physicists (MP) experience high workloads. Little is known about how MPs
   use social support (SS) in times of stress. Methods In collaboration
   with the Workgroup on Prevention of Medical Error, the American
   Association of Physicists in Medicine administered this Human
   Investigation Committee (HIC) approved email survey to 8566 members.
   Respondents were considered likely to seek SS if they answered
   (probably/definitely would) and unlikely to seek support if they
   answered (probably/definitely would not). Logistic regression was
   applied to determine associations between demographic factors and
   willingness to seek support as well as perception of barriers. Results
   One thousand two hundred and ninety-seven members (15.1\%) accessed and
   gave consent for the survey. One thousand and one (11.7\%) respondents
   answered all relevant questions. Respondents were predominantly male
   (69.1\%), MP in radiation oncology (81.8\%), private practice (51.6\%),
   with practice duration> 10 yr (60.2\%). MPs were likely to seek SS for
   personal physical illness (78.63\%), involvement in a medical error
   (73.94\%) or adverse patient outcome (75.17\%). MPs sought SS in the
   setting of personal fatigue (33.2\%) or burnout (44.3\%). Barriers to
   seeking SS were lack of time (80.3\%), and uncertainty about whom to
   access (70.7\%). MPs responded that they would be most likely to seek
   support from an equally experienced medical physicist colleague
   (81.0\%). Most MPs (67.0\%) identified as having experienced stressors,
   with serious family illness (35.2\%), or burnout (32.8\%) being most
   common. Factors associated with MPs unwillingness to seek SS for medical
   error included> 20 yr in practice (vs still in training - OR 0.30, P =
   0.015), and male gender (OR 0.60, P = 0.003). Male gender was associated
   with the lowest willingness to seek support (OR 2.10, P = 0.0001), but
   also with fewer perceived barriers (OR 1.60, P = 0.0075). Conclusion
   Willingness to seek SS is demonstrated, and MPs want colleagues to
   provide support. Given these results, peer support could be considered
   among MPs.},

Title = {Practice Patterns and Attitudes of Surgeons on the Use of Prophylactic
   Mesh to Prevent Parastomal Hernia: A Cross-sectional Survey},
Journal = {WOUND MANAGEMENT \& PREVENTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {65},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Information about surgeons' attitudes toward using prophylactic mesh
   (PM) for parastomal hernia (PSH) prevention is limited. PURPOSE: A
   survey was conducted to assess attitudes/beliefs and surgical practice
   related to PM use for preventing PSH.
   METHODS: A cross-sectional email survey was conducted during April 2017
   among members (surgeons) of the American Hernia Society, European Hernia
   Society, and International Hernia Collaboration. Survey items included
   participant demographic characteristics, knowledge about the incidence
   of PSH, number of permanent stomas created annually, beliefs/opinions
   (knowledge/interest) regarding the use of PM, and surgical practices
   (mesh type and position). Data were collected and tallied using
   SurveyMonkey. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data.
   RESULTS: Of the 5445 emails sent, 497 responses were received, 235
   (47.3\%) from the United States and 197 (39.6\%) from Europe. The
   majority of participants were general surgeons (371, 74.6\%); a small
   percentage were colorectal surgeons (37, 7.4\%). Most respondents (353,
   71.0\%) reported at least 11 years of surgical experience, with 37.3\%
   reporting >20 years' experience. The majority of respondents (340,
   68.4\%) created <15 ostomies per year, more than half (252, 50.7\%)
   consider the incidence of PSH 30\% or below, and 107 (22\%) use PM. The
   most common reason for not using mesh was concern about mesh-related
   complications (141, 41.5\%). When asked about type of mesh, most
   surgeons (153/245, 62.4\%) preferred permanent mesh and an open
   retromuscular approach (97/278, 34.9\%).
   CONCLUSION: Results of the present survey show ongoing ambiguity
   regarding the use of PM for PSH prevention. Education to increase
   awareness about the incidence of PSH and well-designed safety and
   effectiveness studies of preventive strategies are needed to help
   surgeons optimize PSH prevention strategies.},

Title = {Intelligent Identification of Urban Road Hazards by BP Neural Network
   From 3D-GPR GLCM Attributes},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {63},
Abstract = {Road collapses seriously threaten human safety in cities. The effective
   and rapid identification of hidden urban road hazards using 3-D
   ground-penetrating radar (3D-GPR) data is crucial for preventing and
   controlling road collapse accidents. We propose a novel intelligent
   identification method for urban road hazards using a backpropagation
   (BP) artificial neural network based on multiscale gray-level
   co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) attributes derived from 3D-GPR data. The
   characteristic differences in multiscale GLCM attributes between hidden
   hazards and other detected targets are leveraged to construct a road
   hazard identification model using a BP neural network. This model is
   applied to identify hazards from 3D-GPR data, enabling rapid
   localization of hidden urban road hazards. Initially, GPR data are
   processed using zero-time correction, background suppression, and
   filtering. Next, labeled data are created using the radar responses of
   known hazards, wells, pipelines, and strata. Subsequently, after
   applying gradient enhancement processing to the GPR data, the GLCM
   attributes are calculated at different scales to distinguish hazards in
   3-D space from other target bodies. Finally, a neural network model for
   hidden hazard identification is constructed using a BP artificial neural
   network and applied to identify hidden hazards beneath urban roads from
   GPR measurement data. The results show that the prediction accuracy
   exceeds 85\% using the proposed approach. The combination of multiscale
   GLCM attributes and BP neural network is valuable and effective for the
   detection and identification of hidden hazards beneath urban roads.},

Title = {Discontinuation and nonpublication of pediatric otolaryngology clinical
   trials},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {151},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objectives: Randomized controlled trial (RCT) discontinuation and
   nonpublication are potential mechanisms of waste in resources and lead
   to decreased advancement of medical science and compromised ethical
   issues in all specialties. However, the prevalence of discontinued or
   unpublished RCTs regarding common pediatric otolaryngology disorders and
   interventions remains unclear. Study design: Cross-sectional analysis.
   Methods: Retrospective analysis of common pediatric otolaryngology RCTs
   registered in ClinicalTrials.gov up until November 2, 2018. Data were
   collected from the registry, and publication status was identified. If a
   reason for trial discontinuation or nonpublication was not identified
   through a systematic search, corresponding trialists were contacted
   through email. Results: After exclusion, 260 RCTs were included for
   analysis. Analysis found 198 (76\%) RCTs were completed, and 62 (24\%)
   trials were discontinued. The most commonly reported reasons for RCT
   discontinuation were program termination by sponsor or management (7/24;
   29.2\%), lack of participant enrollment, difficulty recruiting, or slow
   accrual (7/24; 29.2\%). A total of 192 (192/260; 73.8\%) published RCTs
   and 68 (68/260; 26.2\%) unpublished RCTs were identified. Twenty-six
   (26/62; 42\%) of the discontinued RCTs reached publication, while 36
   (58\%) remained unpublished. Regarding the completed RCTs, 166 of 198
   (83.8\%) completed trials reached publication, while 32 (32/198; 16.2\%)
   remained unpublished after trial completion. Conclusions: Approximately
   1 in 4 of included RCTs were discontinued or did not reach publication.
   Findings suggest further guidance is needed for RCTs regarding common
   pediatric otolaryngology disorders and interventions. Level of evidence:

Abstract = {Purpose: When barcode medication administration (BCMA) is implemented
   nurses are required to integrate not only a new set of procedures or
   artifacts into everyday work, but also an orientation to medication
   safety itself that is sometimes at odds with their own. This paper
   describes how the nurses' orientation (the Practice Frame) can collide
   with the orientation that is represented by the technology and its
   implementation (the System Frame), resulting in adaptations at the
   individual and organization levels.
   Methods: The paper draws on two qualitative research studies that
   examined the implementation of BCMA in inpatient settings using
   observation and ethnographic fieldwork, content analysis of email
   communications, and interviews with healthcare professionals.
   Results: Two frames of reference are described: the System Frame and the
   Practice Frame. We found collisions of these frames that prompted
   adaptations at the individual and organization levels. The System Frame
   was less integrated and flexible than the Practice Frame, less able to
   account for all of the dimensions of everyday patient care to which
   medication administration is tied.
   Conclusion: Collisions in frames during implementation of new technology
   result in adaptations at the individual and organization level that can
   have a variety of effects. We found adaptations to be a means of
   evolving both the work routines and the technology. Understanding the
   frames of clinical workers when new technology is being designed and
   implemented can inform changes to technology or organizational structure
   and policy that can preclude unproductive or unsafe adaptations. (C)

Abstract = {Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted various systems that drove
   people to adapt to certain technologies, such as electronic government
   services, for daily survival and to meet social distancing requirements.
   Therefore, this study aims to determine the antecedents of e-government
   use based on prospect theory and modified unified theory of acceptance
   use of technology (UTAUT) during a pandemic. Design/methodology/approach
   Convenience sampling of 368 respondents from Vietnam was conducted, and
   questionnaires were distributed personally or by email. The data were
   analyzed following a two-stage structural equation modeling (SEM) using
   SPSS v23 and AMOS v23. The validity and reliability of the instrument
   were tested and ensured. Findings Results show that perceived severity
   drives government support and social influence while perceived security
   drives government support, social influence and trust. Social influence
   enhances government support and trust, which both drives e-government
   use. Mediation analysis shows that government support mediates perceived
   the influence of perceived severity on e-government use. Practical
   implications The integration of prospect theory and UTAUT brings into
   light what will drive the adoption of e-government in the context of
   Vietnam. Supporting mechanisms, such as security measures,
   trust-building, government support and social influence, will drive
   citizens to adapt to technologies provided by the government but would
   also rely on the perceived risks and benefits. Originality/value This
   study integrates prospect theory and a modified version of UTAUT to
   explain the drivers of e-government use. The results reveal that under
   uncertainties, government support is critical in driving the use of
   e-government for people to manage the daily lives for survival.},

Abstract = {A Social Network is a social structure made of individuals or
   organizations that are linked by one or more specific types of
   interdependency, such as friends, kinship, terrorist relation, conflict,
   financial exchange, disease transmission (epidemiology), airline routes
   etc. Social Network Analysis is an approach to the study of human or
   organization social interactions. It can be used to investigate kinship
   patterns, community structure or the organization of other formal and
   informal social networks. Recently, email networks have been popular
   source of data for both analysis and visualization of social network of
   a person or organization. In this paper, three types of visualization
   technique to analyze social networks have been considered - Force
   directed layout, Spherical layout and Clustered layout. Each method was
   evaluated with various data sets from an organization. Force directed
   layout is used to view the total network structure (Overview). Spherical
   layout is a 3D method to reveal communication patterns and relationships
   between different groups. Clustered graph layout visualizes a large
   amount of data in an efficient and compact form. It gives a hierarchical
   view of the network. Among the three methods, Clustered layout is the
   best to handle large network and group relationship. Finally, the
   comparative study of these three methods has been given.},

Abstract = {Wearable technologies have created fascinating opportunities for
   patients to treat chronic pain in a discreet, mobile fashion. However,
   many of these health wearables require patients to disclose sensitive
   information, including health information (e.g., heart rate, glucose
   levels) and personal information (location, email, name, etc.).
   Individuals using wearables for treatment of chronic pain may sacrifice
   social health elements, including their privacy, in exchange for better
   physical and mental health. Utilizing communication privacy management,
   a popular disclosure theory, this article explores the policy and
   ethical ramifications of patients disclosing sensitive health
   information in exchange for better health treatment and relief of
   chronic pain. The article identifies scenarios where a user must
   disclose information, and what factors motivate or dissuade disclosure,
   and ultimately the use of a health wearable. Practical implications of
   this conceptual article include an improved understanding of how and why
   consumers may disclose personal data to health wearables, and potential
   impacts for public policy and ethics regarding how wearables and their
   manufacturers entice disclosure of private health information.},

Title = {THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN E-LEARNING SERVICE AND STUDENT SATISFACTION A
   CASE STUDY AT THE SYRIAN VIRTUAL UNIVERSITY (SVU)},
Journal = {BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AND EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Pages = {49-71},
Abstract = {Purpose - This study aims at exploring the impact of electronic services
   provided by the Syrian Virtual University (SVU) on student satisfaction.
   Besides, this study seeks to determine the dimensions of both electronic
   services and customer satisfaction at the SVU, and to what extent these
   dimensions may vary in accordance with different personal
   characteristics among students.
   Research methodology - A quantitative research method was adopted using
   an online questionnaire to collect data from students registering in
   different SVU programs.
   Findings - Overall, results were analysed using the SPSS: 18. The
   results indicated that the relationship between all electronic services
   dimensions and student satisfaction at the SVU were positively
   significant except for the bulk SMS dimension. Electronic service
   dimensions are also all applied throughout the SVU (SMS- Web Request-
   Facebook- email- Electronic library-Website- Learning Management System)
   respectively. Besides, results show that neither electronic services
   dimensions nor satisfaction dimensions vary with regards to gender,
   speciality and age. Furthermore, satisfaction dimensions such as privacy
   and security - ease of use - order fulfil-ment - customer service -
   electronic service portfolio are all applied in the SVU.
   Research limitations - The study in this paper is limited to only one
   university since the Syrian Virtual University is the only virtual
   university in Syria. Also, the study focused only on university's
   students, and not it is administrative staff.
   Practical Implications - the results of this paper are beneficial for
   the SVU future and other universities attempting to provide online
   services. Thus, results from advice the SVU to keep their services
   up-to-date with the latest technological improvements, especially the
   university's website. This could he achieved by making it more users
   friendly and ultimately improve students' satisfaction. Moreover, the
   SVU should highlight the bulk SMS service weaknesses and try to use it
   more efficiently. Furthermore, the SVU employees could use the results
   of this paper to segment their current and future services provided in
   the future correctly taking into account the differences between gender
   and other demographical factors.
   Originality/Value - This study is one of the first studies to
   investigate the relationships between F-Learning services and student
   satisfaction in virtual environments, especially the Syrian Virtual
   Universities SVU. Moreover, this study investigates specific dimensions
   regarding both E-services and student satisfaction and brings up a
   reliable model for further research.},

Pages = {1-24},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The Internet has become an essential component of our everyday social
   and financial activities. Internet is not important for individual users
   only but also for organizations, because organizations that offer online
   trading can achieve a competitive edge by serving worldwide clients.
   Internet facilitates reaching customers all over the globe without any
   market place restrictions and with effective use of e-commerce. As a
   result, the number of customers who rely on the Internet to perform
   procurements is increasing dramatically. Hundreds of millions of dollars
   are transferred through the Internet every day. This amount of money was
   tempting the fraudsters to carry out their fraudulent operations. Hence,
   Internet users may be vulnerable to different types of web threats,
   which may cause financial damages, identity theft, loss of private
   information, brand reputation damage and loss of customers' confidence
   in e-commerce and online banking. Therefore, suitability of the Internet
   for commercial transactions becomes doubtful. Phishing is considered a
   form of web threats that is defined as the art of impersonating a
   website of an honest enterprise aiming to obtain user's confidential
   credentials such as usernames, passwords and social security numbers. In
   this article, the phishing phenomena will be discussed in detail. In
   addition, we present a survey of the state of the art research on such
   attack. Moreover, we aim to recognize the up-to-date developments in
   phishing and its precautionary measures and provide a comprehensive
   study and evaluation of these researches to realize the gap that is
   still predominating in this area. This research will mostly focus on the
   web based phishing detection methods rather than email based detection

Abstract = {Background: Reports published directly after terrorist mass casualty
   incidents frequently fail to capture difficulties that may have been
   encountered. An anonymised consensus-based platform may enable
   discussion and collaboration on the challenges faced. Our aim was to
   identify where to focus improvement for future responses.
   Methods: We conducted a mixed methods study by email of clinicians'
   experiences of leading during terrorist mass casualty incidents. An
   initial survey identified features that worked well, or failed to,
   during terrorist mass casualty incidents plus ongoing challenges and
   changes that were implemented as a result. A follow-up, quantitative
   survey measured agreement between responses within each of the themes
   using a Likert scale.
   Results: Thirty-three participants responded from 22 hospitals that had
   received casualties from a terrorist incident, representing 17 cities in
   low-middle, middle and high income countries. The first survey
   identified themes of sufficient (sometimes abundant) human resource,
   although coordination of staff was a challenge. Difficulties highlighted
   were communication, security, and management of blast injuries. The most
   frequently implemented changes were education on specific injuries,
   revising future plans and preparatory exercises. Persisting challenges
   were lack of time allocated to training and psychological well-being.
   The follow-up survey recorded highest agreement amongst correspondents
   on the need for re-triage at hospital (90\% agreement), coordination
   roles (85\% agreement), flexibility (100\% agreement), and large-scale
   exercises (95\% agreement).
   Conclusion: This survey collates international experience gained from
   clinicians managing terrorist mass casualty incidents. The organisation
   of human response, rather than consumption of physical supplies, emerged
   as the main finding.},

Abstract = {Mainstream social platforms boast billions of users worldwide. In recent
   years, popular social platforms have seen a decline in their users that
   are choosing to migrate to alternative-tech social applications
   reinforced by frustrations of mainstream social platforms over alleged
   censorship of free speech and banning of predominant public figures such
   as the former president of the United States (U.S.). As such, group
   effect of similar minded users on alternative-tech social platforms may
   lead to fostering events such as the U.S. Capitol attack on January 6th,
   2021, where the spreading of false information and extremist ideologies
   through alt-tech applications such as Parler and MeWe took place. These
   cases demonstrate the immense forensic need to understand how
   alternative-tech social applications operate and what they store about
   their users' personal information and activities. We present the primary
   account for the digital forensic study of (n = 9) alternative-tech
   social applications used on Android and iOS devices. Our analysis
   includes Parler, MeWe, CloutHub, Wimkin, Minds (Minds Mobile and Minds
   Chat), SafeChat, 2nd1st, and GETTR. Results revealed that some
   applications do store unencrypted user information on the devices, such
   as usernames, phone numbers, email addresses, posts and comments, and
   private chat messages. Furthermore, some security vulnerabilities were
   discovered that allow users to download data that should have been
   private (such as sent private images) without authentication and
   authorization by other users. Finally, to aid in the analysis and
   automatic extraction of relevant evidence, we share Alternative Social
   Networking Applications Analysis Tool (ASNAAT), that automatically
   aggregates forensically relevant data from the alt-tech social
   networking applications when presented with a mobile device's forensic
   image. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Title = {Exploring Young People's Perceptions of the Effectiveness of Text-Based
   Online Counseling: Mixed Methods Pilot Study},
Journal = {JMIR MENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 3},
Abstract = {Background: Young people aged 10-24 years are at the highest risk for
   mental health problems and are the least likely to seek professional
   treatment. Owing to this population's high consumption of internet
   content, electronic mental (e-mental) health services have increased
   globally, with an aim to address barriers to treatment. Many of these
   services use text-based online counseling (TBOC), which shows promising
   results in supporting young people but also greater variance in outcomes
   compared with adult comparators.
   Objective: This pilot study qualitatively explored the characteristics
   of users aged 15-25 years accessing TBOC services, their motivations for
   access, and their perceptions about factors believed to influence the
   effectiveness of these modalities.
   Methods: E-surveys were administered naturalistically to 100 young
   service users aged 15-25 years who accessed webchat and email counseling
   services via an Australian e-mental health service. Thematic analysis of
   qualitative themes and quantitative descriptive and proportional data
   presented in electronic surveys were examined across the areas of user
   characteristics, motivations for selecting TBOC modalities, and their
   perceptions of TBOC effectiveness.
   Results: Participants were predominately female high school students of
   Caucasian or European descent from middle socioeconomic status, living
   with their parents in major cities. Four domains and various themes and
   subthemes were related to participants' reasons for accessing TBOC and
   perceptions of its effectiveness: user characteristics (ie, physical and
   mental health syndrome and perceived social difficulties), selection
   factors (ie, safety, avoidance motivation, accessibility, and
   expectation), factors perceived to increase effectiveness (ie, general
   therapeutic benefits, positive modality and service factors, and
   persisting with counseling to increase benefit), and factors perceived
   to decrease effectiveness (ie, negative modality and service factors,
   and persisting with counseling despite benefit).
   Conclusions: Participants were motivated to use TBOC to increase their
   sense of safety in response to negative perceptions of their social
   skills and the response of the online counsellor to their presenting
   problem. By using TBOC services, they also sought to improve their
   access to mental health services that better met their expectations.
   Factors that increased effectiveness of TBOC were the counsellor's
   interpersonal skills, use of text-based communication, and persisting
   with beneficial counseling sessions. Factors that reduced TBOC
   effectiveness were poor timeliness in response to service requests,
   experiencing no change in their presenting problem, not knowing what
   post-counseling action to take, and persisting with ineffective
   counseling sessions.},

Journal = {WORK-A JOURNAL OF PREVENTION ASSESSMENT \& REHABILITATION},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {51},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many entry-level and experienced healthcare professionals
   have not received training in workplace violence prevention strategies.
   OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the development, content, and initial
   qualitative evaluation of an on-line course designed to give healthcare
   workers an opportunity to acquire free workplace violence prevention
   training while earning free continuing education units.
   METHODS: A group of healthcare violence prevention researchers worked
   via email and face-to-face meetings to decide appropriate content for
   the course. Educational strategies used in the course include: text;
   video re-enactments of real-life workplace violence incidents; and
   videos of nurses discussing incidents of violence. Initial evaluation
   involved a focus group of nurses to discuss the course content and
   navigation.
   RESULTS: The on-line course has thirteen units that take approximately
   15 minutes each to complete. The focus group participants liked the
   ``resume-where-you-left-off{''} technology that enables the user to
   complete any portion of the course, leave to do something, and return to
   the course where they left off. Participants viewed the ``Nurses'
   Voices{''} videos as relevant illustrations of violence that nurses face
   in their workplaces.
   CONCLUSIONS: The focus group participants considered the course to be an
   effective learning tool for people new to the profession and for those
   with seniority.},

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {20},
Pages = {4296-4307},
Abstract = {Existing occluded person re-identification (re-ID) methods mainly learn
   limited visual information for occluded pedestrians from images.
   However, textual information, which can describe various human
   appearance attributes, is rarely fully utilized in the task. To address
   this issue, we propose a Text-guided Hierarchical Context Blending
   Network (THCB-Net) for occluded person re-ID. Specifically, at the data
   level, informative multi-modal inputs are first generated to make full
   use of the auxiliary role of textual information and make image data
   have a strong inductive bias for occluded environments. At the feature
   expression level, we design a novel Hierarchical Context Blending (HCB)
   module that can adaptively integrate shallow appearance features
   obtained by CNNs and multi-scale semantic features from visual
   transformer encoder. At the model optimization level, a Multi-modal
   Feature Interaction (MFI) module is proposed to learn the multi-modal
   information of pedestrians from texts and images, then guide the visual
   transformer encoder and HCB module to further learn discriminative
   identity information for occluded pedestrians through Image-Multimodal
   Contrastive (IMC) learning. Extensive experiments on standard occluded
   person re-ID benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed THCB-Net
   outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available soon.},

Abstract = {Objective: Although frontline clinicians are crucial in implementing and
   spreading innovations, their engagement in quality improvement remains
   suboptimal. Our goal was to identify facilitators and barriers to the
   development and engagement of clinicians in quality improvement.
   Design: A 25-item questionnaire informed by theoretical frameworks was
   developed, tested and disseminated by email.
   Settings: Members and fellows of the International Society for Quality
   in Healthcare.
   Participants: 1010 eligible participants (380 fellows and 647 members).
   Interventions: None.
   Main Outcome Measures: Self-efficacy and effectiveness in conducting and
   leading quality improvement activities.
   Results: We received 212 responses from 50 countries, a response rate of
   21\%. Dedicated time for quality improvement, mentorship and coaching
   and a professional quality improvement network were significantly
   related to higher self-efficacy. Factors enhancing effectiveness were
   dedicated time for quality improvement, multidisciplinary improvement
   teams, professional development in quality improvement, ability to
   select areas for improvement and organizational values and culture.
   Inadequate time, mentorship, organizational support and access to
   professional development resources were key barriers. Personal strengths
   contributing to effectiveness were the ability to identify problems that
   need to be fixed, reflecting on and learning from experiences and
   facilitating sharing of ideas. Key quality improvement implementation
   challenges were adopting new payment models, demonstrating the business
   case for quality and safety and building a culture of accountability and
   transparency.
   Conclusions: Our findings highlight areas that organizations and
   professional development programs should focus on to promote clinician
   development and engagement in quality improvement. Barriers related to
   training, time, mentorship, organizational support and implementation
   must be concurrently addressed to augment the effectiveness of other
   approaches.},

Abstract = {Between 65\% and 91\% of human-patient sonographers report
   musculoskeletal symptoms related to their work activities. Ergonomic
   risk factors associated with musculoskeletal symptoms and
   musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) include force, repetition, and awkward
   postures of the upper extremities. We hypothesized that veterinary
   sonographers experience similar risk factor exposures as their
   colleagues in human-patient sonography, and that work-related exposures
   may lead to similar prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms and
   disorders. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Society
   of Diagnostic Medical Sonography published MSD prevention guidelines in
   2003. Similar guidance for sonographers examining animal patients does
   not exist. This cross-sectional study was designed to evaluate the
   prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms among veterinary sonographers and
   identify reported risk factors. A 59-item survey questionnaire was
   administered via email to veterinary specialists likely to perform
   ultrasound. Musculoskeletal pain related to performing ultrasound exams
   was reported by 62\% of the respondents. Musculoskeletal symptoms were
   significantly associated with female gender (odds ratio {[}OR], 4.55;
   95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 2.0410.19), age (OR, 1.06; 95\% CI,
   1.01, 1.10), previous work-related trauma (OR, 6.86; 95\% CI, 1.71,
   27.40), not consistently using a normal height chair(OR, 2.63; 95\% CI,
   1.19, 5.80), and 15 degrees- 45 degrees abduction of shoulder(OR, 2.34;
   95\% CI, 1.11, 4.92) . It was concluded that the prevalence of
   musculoskeletal symptoms among veterinary sonographers was similar to
   that occurring in human-patient sonographers. (c) 2012 Veterinary

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Introduction: Older age has been associated to serious adverse events
   (AE) following yellow fever (YF) vaccination in passive surveillance
   studies, but few prospective studies involving seniors have been
   published.
   Results: Nine hundred and six persons were evaluated; 78 were not
   vaccinated and 828 received the vaccine; 700 (84.7\%) were interviewed
   after vaccination: 593 (84.7\%) did not report any symptoms or signs
   following YF vaccine; 107 (15.3\%) reported at least one AE temporally
   associated to YF vaccination: 97 (13.9\%) had systemic AE and 17 (2.4\%)
   reported AE at the injection site (7 had both systemic and local AE).
   Data regarding previous vaccination was available for 655 subjects.
   Statistically significant higher rates of systemic AE were observed
   among subjects who received the first YF vaccination (17.5\%) in
   comparison to persons who had been previously vaccinated (9.5\%).
   Methods: This observational prospective study aimed to describe AE
   following YF vaccination in persons aged >= 60 y. From March 2009 to
   April 2010, seniors who sought YF vaccination at a reference
   Immunization Center in Sao Paulo city, Brazil, were included.
   Demographic and clinical data, previous YF vaccination, travel
   destination and the final decision regarding YF vaccination or not were
   collected from standardized medical records. Active AE assessment was
   done through telephone or electronic mail interview performed
   approximately 14 d after immunization.
   Conclusion: Most persons aged >= 60 y may be safely vaccinated against
   YF. Before vaccination, they must be carefully screened for conditions
   associated to altered immunocompetence and for risk of exposure to YF.},

   practioners who responded performed respirator evaluations; 75\% did
   more than just the required Occupational Safety Health Administration
   questionnaire. Cardiovascular and respiratory symptoms and problems
   wearing a respirator (87\% to 95\%) were the most common reasons for
   additional testing and denying medical clearance (58\% to 82\%). Sixty
   percent of practioners required workers to have an annual

   specific tests were performed, and the criteria used to determine
   fitness to wear a respirator varied markedly between practioners.
   Further research is needed to determine whether the widespread variation
   is a sign of too little or too much testing by different practioners.},

Title = {Productivity Tracking: A Survey of Critical Care Pharmacist Practices

Journal = {HOSPITAL PHARMACY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {57},
Number = {2},
Pages = {273-280},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Introduction: The position paper on critical care pharmacy services
   describes two tiers of responsibilities: essential and desirable
   activities. Activities are categorized into five domains: patient care,
   quality improvement, research and scholarship, training and education,
   and professional development. Documentation of these activities can be
   important for justifying pharmacist positions, comparing pharmacy
   practice models, conducting performance evaluations, and tracking
   individual workload; however, limited recommendations are provided for
   standardized productivity tracking, and national practices remain
   largely uncharacterized. Objectives: The purpose of this survey was to
   describe documentation practices of critical care pharmacist activities.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was distributed via email to 1694
   members of the ACCP critical care practice research network. The survey
   asked respondents to describe the methods used to document productivity
   as it relates to the 5 domains. Results: Seventy-nine (4.7\%) critical
   care pharmacists from 63 institutions completed the survey. Intervention
   documentation was used for position justification and annual reviews
   among 54.4\% and 44.1\% of pharmacists, respectively. Pharmacists were
   routinely expected to perform additional responsibilities beyond patient
   care that contribute to overall productivity, but the percentage of
   institutions that track these activities as a measure of pharmacist
   productivity was relatively low: quality improvement (46\%),
   research/scholarship (29\%), training/education (38\%), and professional
   development (27\%). Documentation of these additional responsibilities
   and activities was primarily used for annual evaluations, but the
   majority of respondents answered that no standardized method for
   tracking activities existed. In multivariate regression, dedicated ICU
   pharmacists was a significant predictor for increased satisfaction
   (Exp(ss) 4.498, 95\% CI 1.054-19.187, P = .042). Conclusion: Practice
   variation exists in how and for what intent critical care pharmacists
   track productivity. Further evaluation and standardization of
   productivity tracking may aid in position justification and practice
   model evaluation for dedicated ICU pharmacists in today's value-based
   era.},

Abstract = {The ``Positive Action for Today's Health{''} (PATH) trial tested an
   environmental intervention to increase walking in underserved
   communities.
   Three matched communities were randomized to a police-patrolled walking
   plus social marketing, a police-patrolled walking-only, or a no-walking
   intervention. The 24-month intervention addressed safety and access for
   physical activity (PA) and utilized social marketing to enhance
   environmental supports for PA. African-Americans (N = 434; 62 \%
   females; aged 51 +/- 16 years) provided accelerometry and psychosocial
   measures at baseline and 12, 18, and 24 months. Walking attendance and
   trail use were obtained over 24 months.
   There were no significant differences across communities over 24 months
   for moderate-to-vigorous PA. Walking attendance in the social marketing
   community showed an increase from 40 to 400 walkers per month at 9
   months and sustained similar to 200 walkers per month through 24 months.
   No change in attendance was observed in the walking-only community.
   Findings support integrating social marketing strategies to increase
   walking in underserved African-Americans (ClinicalTrials.gov
   \#NCT01025726).},

Title = {Agent-based modeling of malware dynamics in heterogeneous environments},

Abstract = {The increasing convergence of power-law networks such as social
   networking and peer-to-peer applications, web-delivered applications,
   and mobile platforms makes today's users highly vulnerable to entirely
   new generations of malware that exploit vulnerabilities in web
   applications and mobile platforms for new infections, while using the
   power-law connectivity for finding new victims. The traditional epidemic
   models based on assumptions of homogeneity, average-degree
   distributions, and perfect-mixing are inadequate to model this type of
   malware propagation. In this paper, we study four aspects crucial to
   modeling malware propagation: application-level interactions among users
   of such networks, local network structure, user mobility, and network
   coordination of malware such as botnets. Since closed-form solutions of
   malware propagation considering these aspects are difficult to obtain,
   we describe an open-source, flexible agent-based emulation framework
   that can be used by malware researchers for studying today's complex
   malware. The framework, called Agent-Based Malware Modeling (AMM),
   allows different applications, network structure, network coordination,
   and user mobility in either a geographic or a logical domain to study
   various infection and propagation scenarios. In addition to traditional
   worms and viruses, the framework also allows modeling network
   coordination of malware such as botnets. The majority of the parameters
   used in the framework can be derived from real-life network traces
   collected from a network, and therefore, represent realistic malware
   propagation and infection scenarios. As representative examples, we
   examine two well-known malware spreading mechanisms: (i) a malicious
   virus such as Cabir spreading among the subscribers of a cellular
   network using Bluetooth and (ii) a hybrid worm that exploit email and
   file-sharing to infect users of a social network. In both cases, we
   identify the parameters most important to the spread of the epidemic
   based upon our extensive simulation results. Copyright (c) 2011 John

Abstract = {We consider a security setting involving a defender who is required to
   invest (subject to a budget constraint) in protecting a given set of
   nodes against attacks. Each node has a certain value to the defender,
   along with a probability of being successfully compromised, which is a
   function of the investment in that node by the defender. In this
   setting, we consider the impacts of behavioral probability weighting
   (vis-vis the probability of successful attack) on the investment
   strategies; such probability weighting, where humans overweight low
   probabilities and underweight high probabilities, has been identified by
   behavioral economists to be a common feature of human decision-making.
   We show that under appropriate conditions on the probability of
   successful attack, the defender's optimization problem is convex (even
   under probability weighting). Furthermore, we show that behavioral
   probability weighting causes the defender to shift more of her
   investments to the higher-valued nodes and underinvest in the low-value
   nodes, compared to the case where the defender perceives the probability
   of attack correctly. In particular, the number of nodes that have
   positive investment decreases as the defender becomes more behavioral.},

Title = {Mediation of adoption and use: a key strategy for mitigating unintended
   consequences of health IT implementation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {19},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1043-1049},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Objective Without careful attention to the work of users, implementation
   of health IT can produce new risks and inefficiencies in care. This
   paper uses the technology use mediation framework to examine the work of
   a group of nurses who serve as mediators of the adoption and use of a
   barcode medication administration (BCMA) system in an inpatient setting.
   Materials and methods The study uses ethnographic methods to explore the
   mediators' work. Data included field notes from observations, documents,
   and email communications. This variety of sources enabled triangulation
   of findings between activities observed, discussed in meetings, and
   reported in emails.
   Results Mediation work integrated the BCMA tool with nursing practice,
   anticipating and solving implementation problems. Three themes of
   mediation work include: resolving challenges related to coordination,
   integrating the physical aspects of BCMA into everyday practice, and
   advocacy work.
   Discussion Previous work suggests the following factors impact mediation
   effectiveness: proximity to the context of use, understanding of users'
   practices and norms, credibility with users, and knowledge of the
   technology and users' technical abilities. We describe three additional
   factors observed in this case: `influence on system developers,'
   `influence on institutional authorities,' and `understanding the network
   of organizational relationships that shape the users work.'
   Conclusion Institutionally supported clinicians who facilitate adoption
   and use of health IT systems can improve the safety and effectiveness of
   implementation through the management of unintended consequences.
   Additional research on technology use mediation can advance the science
   of implementation by providing decision-makers with theoretically
   durable, empirically grounded evidence for designing implementations.},

Title = {Graph Attention-Based Dual Enhancement for Multiview Clustering},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 MAR 20},
Abstract = {In deep contrastive graph clustering, many methods tend to adopt a
   singular enhancement strategy, focusing either on structural or
   attribute augmentation. This limited approach constrains the model's
   ability to integrate multidimensional information, resulting in an
   imbalance in information utilization. Furthermore, the randomness
   involved in the selection of negative samples may lead to blurred
   distinctions between positive and negative samples. Therefore, we
   introduce a graph attention-based dual enhancement multiview clustering
   (GA-DE-MVC). The GA-DE-MVC first encodes structure and attributes
   through attention mechanisms and fully connected layers to achieve dual
   enhancement of structure and attributes. Then, it selects the farthest
   sample as the negative sample based on the Euclidean distance between
   cluster centers, to alleviate the randomness in negative sample
   selection, thereby enhancing the distinctiveness between positive and
   negative samples.The experimental results on six datasets surpass
   existing algorithms, verifying the effectiveness of the GA-DE-MVC
   algorithm.},

Volume = {89},

Abstract = {The Western Upper Peninsula of Michigan includes six rural counties and
   one Tribal Nation. The region is characterized by long winters, legacies
   of the extractive mining economy, and the infrastructural features of
   extreme rurality, including aging housing and low health service
   density. The region also faces exceptionally high electricity prices.
   There is limited research on the public health implications of energy
   service disruption in rural regions resulting from the increasing
   intensity and frequency of weather events caused by climate change. This
   article presents research findings examining the readiness of health
   facilities in this area to manage the rising intensity, severity, and
   frequency of severe weather that could disrupt energy services. The
   study also considers how this knowledge can guide decision-making to
   improve energy service access and maintain resilient public health
   services in the region. This exploratory study utilized a qualitative
   approach that combines semi-structured interviews with public health
   stakeholders and a short survey to triangulate the findings from health
   facilities. Given the pivotal role of dependable energy services in
   community health, these findings underscore the community's perception
   of self-reliance as both an asset and a hurdle. This perception aligns
   with the realities of rural communities at the ``end of the line{''}
   regarding critical infrastructure, which also serves as a formidable
   barrier to social organization and infrastructure access during energy
   service disruptions that can severely impact public health.},

Title = {Corticosteroid-sparing therapy: practice patterns among uveitis
   specialists},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMIC INFLAMMATION AND INFECTION},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {2},
Pages = {21-28},
Abstract = {Purpose This study aims to determine uveitis specialists' practice
   patterns, preferences, and perceptions of corticosteroid-sparing
   therapies for the initial treatment of chronic noninfectious uveitis.
   Methods A survey was distributed to the American Uveitis Society and
   Proctor email listservs in order to restrict the respondents to
   specialists who likely have extensive experience in the use of
   immunomodulatory therapy. Topics included effectiveness, usage, and
   preferences related to seven immunomodulatory treatments.
   Results Among the 45 responders, the majority (59\%) had greater than 10
   years of experience treating uveitis. Methotrexate was the most commonly
   used initial therapy for anterior, intermediate, and
   posterior/panuveitis (85\%, 57\%, and 37\%), and the most preferred for
   anterior (55\%). Mycophenolate mofetil was the most preferred for
   intermediate (35\%) and posterior/panuveitis (42\%). Primary reasons not
   to prescribe a treatment were effectiveness for azathioprine,
   safety/tolerability for cyclosporine and cyclophosphamide, and a mixture
   of cost, safety/tolerability, and difficulty of administration for the
   biologic drugs.
   Conclusions Within the group of highly experienced uveitis specialists,
   methotrexate is still the most commonly used initial treatment. Although
   newer biologic drugs are seen as effective, they are not commonly used,
   or even preferred, as initial corticosteroid-sparing treatment.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD MICROBIOLOGY},

Volume = {285},
Pages = {110-128},

Abstract = {In a recent report by risk assessment experts on the identification of
   food safety priorities using the Delphi technique, foodborne viruses
   were recognized among the top rated food safety priorities and have
   become a greater concern to the food industry over the past few years.
   Food safety experts agreed that control measures for viruses throughout
   the food chain are required. However, much still needs to be understood
   with regard to the effectiveness of these controls and how to properly
   validate their performance, whether it is personal hygiene of food
   handlers or the effects of processing of at risk foods or the
   interpretation and action required on positive virus test result. This
   manuscript provides a description of foodborne viruses and their
   characteristics, their responses to stress and technologies developed
   for viral detection and control. In addition, the gaps in knowledge and
   understanding, and future perspectives on the application of viral
   detection and control strategies for the food industry, along with
   suggestions on how the food industry could implement effective control
   strategies for viruses in foods. The current state of the science on
   epidemiology, public health burden, risk assessment and management
   options for viruses in food processing environments will be highlighted
   in this review.},

Abstract = {Objectives: As our social worlds become increasingly digitally
   connected, so too has concern about older adults falling victim to
   ``phishing{''} emails, which attempt to deceive a person into identity
   theft and fraud. In the present study, we investigated whether older age
   is associated with differences in perceived suspiciousness of phishing
   emails.
   Methods: Sixty-five cognitively normal middle-aged to older adults rated
   a series of genuine and phishing emails on a scale from definitely safe
   to definitely suspicious.
   Results: Although older age was not related to a shift in overall
   perception of email safety, older age was related to worse
   discrimination between genuine and phishing emails, according to
   perceived suspiciousness.
   Discussion: These findings suggest that cognitively normal older adults
   may be at particular risk for online fraud because of an age-associated
   reduction in their sensitivity to the credibility of emails.},

Abstract = {Variation in availability, format, and standardization of patient
   attributes across health care organizations impacts patient-matching
   performance. We report on the changing nature of patient-matching
   features available from 2010-2020 across diverse care settings. We asked
   38 health care provider organizations about their current patient
   attribute data-collection practices. All sites collected name, date of
   birth (DOB), address, and phone number. Name, DOB, current address,
   social security number (SSN), sex, and phone number were most commonly
   used for cross-provider patient matching. Electronic health record
   queries for a subset of 20 participating sites revealed that DOB, first
   name, last name, city, and postal codes were highly available (>90\%)
   across health care organizations and time. SSN declined slightly in the
   last years of the study period. Birth sex, gender identity, language,
   country full name, country abbreviation, health insurance number,
   ethnicity, cell phone number, email address, and weight increased over
   50\% from 2010 to 2020. Understanding the wide variation in available
   patient attributes across care settings in the United States can guide
   selection and standardization efforts for improved patient matching in

Abstract = {BackgroundThe rapid development and deployment of effective COVID-19
   vaccines have been critical to halt the spread of the pandemic. India
   started vaccinating children in early 2022, however, vaccine uptake has
   been suboptimal.MethodsBetween September and November 2022, we conducted
   an online survey that was disseminated to eligible participants via
   email, text messages and social media platforms across India. The survey
   aimed to gather the perspectives of Indian healthcare providers
   regarding key factors related to the rollout of paediatric COVID-19
   vaccines. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse participant
   demographics and responses on knowledge about paediatric COVID-19
   vaccines, perceived risks and benefits, and vaccine rollout
   strategies.ResultsThe survey yielded 805 respondents from 23 Indian
   states; 63.5\% were men, 97.3\% were paediatricians, median age was 44
   years (IQR 25-81). Eighty-one per cent and 65.2\% respondents had heard
   about the most common paediatric COVID-19 vaccines in India, Covaxin and
   Corbevax, but only 52.9\%, 53.7\% and 62.1\% felt adequately informed
   about their safety, efficacy and vaccination schedules, respectively.
   Thirty per cent of respondents were unaware of vaccination guidelines.
   Eighty-five per cent of respondents felt that vaccines would reduce the
   incidence of severe disease, hospitalisation and deaths, and 60.6\% felt
   children with comorbidities should be prioritised for vaccination.
   Perceived supply side barriers included lack of enforcement of
   guidelines (45.2\%) and adverse effects following immunisation
   monitoring systems (37.6\%), and on the demand side, parental vaccine
   hesitancy (64.4\%). Eighty-one per cent believed that school-based
   vaccination strategies would be highly effective in increasing
   uptake.ConclusionsMost respondents were in support of the COVID-19
   paediatric vaccination, although just over half did not feel adequately
   informed. Concerns about vaccine hesitancy among caregivers were the
   leading reported barrier. Targeted interventions are needed to provide
   adequate knowledge support to healthcare providers and evidence-based
   public health messaging to reduce vaccine hesitancy among caregivers.},

Abstract = {Sustainable Patient Information Network for Primary Care Health Center
   is needed for Indonesia. There are many of remote, isolated or urban
   area, which causes transportation problems and telecommunication
   problems, for example: necessity of wireless infrastructure. The
   Internet and its free software is the main agent for this system
   combining with Information and Communication Technology. We develop low
   speed communication system to access the Internet using Internet radio
   packet and used PostgreSQL data base server on Linux machines. Our
   development is based on a data base managing system called Automatic
   Distributed Synchronizing Data Base System. This system connects every
   health center to each other and avoid central data storage which common
   use in this day. It is a good opportunity for developing country such as
   Indonesia to use open free software. And radio packet communication uses
   radio media is no connection charge like telephone line for data
   communication. A general practitioner in remote and isolated area can
   get assistance from a specialist in one urban area using email. The
   study opens perspective for a further data storage, distribution,
   synchronizing, maintenance and security.},

Title = {``You're kind of at war with yourself as a nurse{''}: Perspectives of
   inpatient nurses on treating people who present with a comorbid opioid
   use disorder},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {14},

Month = {OCT 24},
Abstract = {Background
   In the midst of an opioid epidemic, health care workers are encountering
   an increasing number of patients who have opioid use disorder in
   addition to complex social, behavioral and medical issues. Of all the
   clinicians in the hospital, nurses spend the most time with hospitalized
   patients who have opioid use disorder, yet there has been little
   research exploring their experiences in caring for this population. The
   objective of this study was to assess the attitudes, perceptions, and
   training needs of nurses in the inpatient setting when caring for
   patients who have opioid use disorder.
   Methods
   One-on-one in-depth interviews were conducted with nurses working at a
   large academic medical center in Boston, MA, using a semi-structured
   interview guide. Nurses were recruited via email notifications and
   subsequent snowball sampling. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and
   analyzed using a grounded theory approach.
   Results
   Data from in-depth interviews with 22 nurses were grouped into six
   themes: (1) stigma, (2) assessing \& treating pain, (3) feelings of burn
   out, (4) communication between providers, (5) safety \& security, and
   (6) opportunities for change. These themes were organized within four
   ecological levels of the Socio-Ecological Model: I) societal context,
   II) hospital environment, Ill) interpersonal interactions, and IV)
   individual factors. Nurses were cognizant of the struggles that patients
   who have opioid use disorder confront during hospitalization such as
   pain, withdrawal and stigma, and elaborated on how these challenges
   translate to professional and emotional strain among nurses. Nurses
   offered recommendations by which the hospital could streamline care for
   this population, including expanded role support for nurses and more
   structured policies regarding care for patients who present with a
   comorbid opioid use disorder.
   Conclusion
   Our results highlight the need for the development of programs targeting
   both organizational culture and the inpatient nurse quality of life to
   ultimately enhance quality of care for patients who present with opioid
   use disorder.},

Abstract = {Objective: to identify the extent to which Early Warning Systems (EWS)
   are used by midwives in the United Kingdom (UK), the maternity settings
   they are used in, physiological parameters used to `trigger' referral,
   training provision, barriers to implementation and role in preventing
   maternal morbidity.
   Design: cross-sectional survey of heads of midwifery services. An email
   questionnaire was sent in September 2012.
   Setting: UK NHS secondary care organisations providing maternity care.
   Findings: heads of midwifery from 107 (68\%) of 157 NHS organisations
   responded, with 108 questionnaires returned as two organisations had
   recently merged. All organisations, apart from one which only had a
   free-standing midwifery unit, had introduced EWS. Nearly all respondents
   (99\%) reported EWS were used by midwives antenatally, 76\% in labour
   and 100\% on the postnatal ward. All EWS charts included body
   temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure and
   oxygen saturation although parameters for escalation varied widely.
   Barriers to use of EWS by midwives included overlap with the partogram
   in labour, and staff shortages and delays obtaining clinical review when
   referral was triggered. Two-thirds considered EWS prevented maternal
   morbidity although few could provide supporting evidence, for example,
   audit findings. Training for midwives in use of EWS was available in
   83\% of organisations.
   Conclusion: most UK midwives are using EWS, with the highest use in
   obstetric units. The heterogeneity of EWS currently used potentially
   limits collation of evidence to inform appropriate system level
   responses. Research is needed to evaluate the role of EWS to prevent
   maternal morbidity during and after pregnancy in different maternity
   settings. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved},

Abstract = {Almost 70 years ago, Alan Turing first questioned whether machines could
   think and how this could be examined given the ambiguity of terms. He
   proposed a test for a related question: could a machine imitate a human
   during a text-only natural language conversation. He predicted that by
   the turn of the century, language would have changed to the point that
   speaking about thinking machines would be nothing out of the ordinary.
   Whilst we are not quite there yet, Google did present a recording of its
   new Assistant making a hair -dresser's appointment onstage at I/O 2018,
   sounding natural and even throwing in an `mmhmmm'. Dubbed a new
   generation of Artificial Intelligence (Al), it is clearly far ahead of
   current of Internet of Things (IoT) devices interacting with users, such
   as Alexa, Cortana, or Siri. Two other prominent examples include Deep
   Blue and AlphaGo, yet there are numerous other examples and applications
   that are used daily, such as email spam filters, plagiarism checkers,
   image recognition on social media, speech recognition or online
   shopping. It is clear that AI has become the new buzzword taking over
   from all things cyber, but what do we actually mean when we use the
   term? This article argues that there are three main reasons for the
   inconsistent use of Al: a lack of understanding, leading to Al being a
   magical solution, a doomsday device, neither and both at the same time;
   a heated, often ethical, debate on the application of Al to armed
   conflict; and the opportunity that Al presents for financial gain.},

Title = {Effectiveness of four outreach modalities to patients overdue for

Volume = {27},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Purpose Papanicolaou (Pap) testing has dramatically decreased cervical
   cancer incidence in the USA, but only 83 \% of women screen according to
   guidelines. Our study aimed to examine the real-world effectiveness of
   various outreach methods in engaging patients who are overdue for
   cervical cancer screening.
   Methods In total, 1,100 patients at an urban federally qualified health
   center overdue for Pap testing were randomized to receive usual care
   (control), letter outreach, email outreach, telephone outreach, or
   multimodal (letter/email/telephone) outreach over a period of 3 months.
   Eighteen months after randomization, medical records were used to
   determine whether and when each patient had obtained a Pap.
   Results Compared to patients receiving usual care, patients in the
   multimodal (36 vs. 21 \%, AOR 2.3, 95 \% CI 1.4, 3.6) and telephone (29
   vs. 21 \%, AOR 1.7, 95 \% CI 1.1, 2.8) outreach groups were
   significantly more likely to receive cervical cancer screening during
   the follow-up period. Intervention effects were similar among older and
   younger patients. Telephone, multimodal, and letter outreach resulted in
   significantly lower median time to screening among patients who did
   screen (119, 122, and 157 days, respectively) in those groups as
   compared to the usual care group (270 days).
   Conclusions This is the first study to perform a direct, randomized
   comparison of four distinct cervical cancer outreach intervention
   modalities with a control usual care group, ensuring comparability
   across intervention methods. In an urban primary care setting, a
   multimodal outreach strategy was most effective at increasing the
   proportion of overdue patients who undergo cervical screening and
   decreasing time to screening.},

Abstract = {Objective: To examine differences between gay, lesbian, and bisexual
   (GLB) and non-GLB university students in alcohol and other drug use
   (AOD) and related consequences as well as the relevance of violence,
   perceived safety, and stress to any such differences in AOD use and
   related concerns.
   Methods: A random representative sample of university students (n = 988)
   were recruited via email for an online survey. Linear regression models
   assessed associations between identifying as GLB and AOD use and related
   consequences.
   Results: Regression models (adjusted for gender) indicated that, in
   comparison to heterosexual students. GLB students were more likely to
   report recent illicit drug use (AOR=2.0; 95\% Cl: 1.1-3.9), more
   frequent negative AOD consequences (beta=5.5, SE=1.4, p<0.0001), and
   having seriously thought about/attempted suicide due to AOD use in the
   past year (AOR = 6.6; 95\% Cl: 3.0-14.3). Study findings also suggested
   that violence, safety, and stress variables partially contribute to ACID

Abstract = {Few ambulatory medication reconciliation tools exist. Transitions
   between inpatient and outpatient care can result in medication
   discrepancies. An interdisciplinary team designed a new `Secure
   Messaging for Medication Reconciliation Tool' (SMMRT) within a patient
   web portal and piloted it among 60 patients at a Veterans Affairs
   hospital, an integrated system with a shared electronic health record.
   Recently discharged patients used SMMRT to view their medications in a
   secure email message and replied using SMMRT's interactive form,
   verifying their medication regimens and clarifying any inaccuracies. In
   total, 108 medication discrepancies and 23 potential adverse drug events
   (ADEs) were seen. Nearly 50\% of the potential ADEs were classified as
   serious. Overall, participants were enthusiastic about SMMRT; 90\% said
   they would use SMMRT again. Enabling patients to conduct medication
   reconciliation through a web portal is feasible in the transition from
   inpatient to outpatient care and may improve medication safety.},

Abstract = {Objective: To quantify perceptions of tap water among low-income mothers
   with young children residing in Michigan and examine associations
   between perceptions of tap water, mothers' and young children's beverage
   intake, and mothers' infant feeding practices. Design: Cross-sectional
   study. Setting: Online survey. Participants: Medicaid-insured
   individuals who had given birth at a large Midwestern US hospital
   between fall 2016 and fall 2020 were invited by email to complete a
   survey in winter 2020 (N 3881); 15 center dot 6 \% (N 606) completed
   eligibility screening, 550 (90 center dot 8 \%) were eligible to
   participate, and 500 (90 center dot 9 \%) provided valid survey data
   regarding perceptions of tap water, self and child beverage intake, and
   infant feeding practices. Results: Two-thirds (66 center dot 2 \%) of
   mothers reported that their home tap water was safe to drink without a
   filter, while 21 center dot 6 \% were unsure about the safety of their
   home tap water. Mothers' perceptions of their home tap water were
   associated with their own tap and bottled water intake and their young
   children's tap water and bottled water intake. Mothers with more
   negative perceptions of tap water in general, independent of their
   perceptions about their home tap water, consumed more bottled water and
   sugar-sweetened beverages, and their young children drank bottled water
   and fruit drinks more frequently. Few associations were observed between
   mothers' perceptions of tap water and infant feeding practices.
   Conclusions: Uncertainty about tap water safety and negative perceptions
   of tap water are common among low-income Michigan mothers. These beliefs
   may contribute to less healthful and more costly beverage intake among
   mothers and their young children.},

Title = {Risky alcohol use in Danish physicians: Associated with alexithymia and
   burnout?},
Journal = {DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {160},
Pages = {119-126},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Background: Alcohol abuse may be elicited by psychological problems and
   can influence physicians' health and patient safety. To act on it, we
   need knowledge on the prevalence of the disorder and its associations
   with psychological factors and physicians' well-being. The aim of this
   study was to explore whether burnout and alexithymia are associated with
   risky alcohol consumption in physicians and whether burnout mediates the
   association between alexithymia and risky alcohol consumption.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 4,000 randomly selected
   physicians received an electronic questionnaire by email containing the
   Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), the Maslach Burnout
   Inventory Human-Services-Survey (MBI-HSS) and the Toronto Alexithymia
   Scale (TAS-20). A total of 1,841 physicians completed the questionnaire
   (46\%).
   Results: 18.8\% reached the criteria for risky alcohol consumption. The
   likelihood of having risky alcohol consumption was associated with high
   levels of alexithymia (OR = 1.93, 95\%Cl=1.37-2.74, P<0.001). Moreover,
   risky alcohol consumption was associated with burnout (OR=1.86,
   95\%0=1.13-3.05, P<0.014) and each individual burnout dimension:
   emotional exhaustion (OR=1.89, 95\%CI=1.33-2.69, P<0.001),
   depersonalisation (OR = 2.23, 95\%Cl = 1.53-3.25, P<0.001) and low
   levels of personal accomplishment (OR = 1.66, 95\%CI = 1.14-2.41, P =
   0.008). Mediation analysis suggested that the association between
   alexithymia and risky alcohol consumption was partially mediated through
   depersonalisation.
   Conclusions: The results emphasize a need for enhancing emotional
   self-awareness in physicians as psychological traits, work-pressure and
   alcohol dependence might be self-reinforcing aspects for the individual
   physician. As alcohol dependence and burnout may have consequences for
   patient safety separately, the aggregated influence of these factors has
   to be examined. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an application of a Fuzzy Bayesian based methodology
   for task analysis (BMTA) to identify the particular tasks performed by
   experienced call center agents when responding to calls. A total of 126
   customer calls were analyzed pertaining to 55 printer models and 70
   software and hardware issues. To develop the model, each exchange of
   information between customer and agent was first classified into one of
   72 task categories by a human expert. This data was then used to train
   the model to predict which subtask was being performed for a particular
   exchange of information. Model testing results showed an overall hit
   rate was above 50\%, false alarm rate was less than 1\%, and sensitivity
   value d' was above 2.5, supporting the conclusion that Bayesian methods
   can serve as a practical tool for identifying some of the tasks
   performed by a call center agent based on what is said during the
   conversation with the customer. The findings support the conclusion that
   Bayesian methods are capable of learning how to classify tasks performed
   in naturalistic settings based on the results of classifications made by
   a human expert performing task analysis. This result is important,
   because identifying the subtasks performed within a job is a difficult,
   time-consuming process. The most basic application of this Bayesian
   model would also be used to do off-line analysis of human-computer
   interaction historical data such as email files, blogs, texting,
   e-learning, transcribed calls and voice mails. The flexibility and
   mobility of BMTA approach goes in line with the current explosive
   growing number of mobile computing applications and speech recognition
   devices.},

Abstract = {Since the insulation defects, design miscalculations and material
   imperfections in electric equipment lead to partial discharge, the
   detection of these discharges can be used not only to evaluate the
   insulation condition, but also to improve the production process of
   electric equipment. Therefore, these tests are often used in research
   and development departments. However, the procedure is usually
   time-consuming and can occupy significant human resources. Moreover, in
   repeated tests the human error can become apparent. As a solution to
   this problem, automation of the tests presents itself as the solution.
   In this paper, an automated system for detection of partial discharges
   in oil-paper insulation under alternating voltage is described. The
   automation test system consists of multiple control and acquisition
   subsystems. To keep the same test conditions in multiple tests, a heat
   insulated test tank with oil heaters is made for the regulation of oil
   and model temperature. Also, a voltage control system is implemented,
   which can raise and continuously regulate the test voltage, as well as
   rapidly switch off the voltage in case of partial discharge events to
   protect the test object. In high voltage tests the automation safety is
   a crucial factor, therefore measures are taken to prevent and detect
   equipment failure. Furthermore, communication of the automation system
   with the test engineer is enabled via status email messages, data
   logging and test recording. The above-mentioned system can follow the
   given test procedure and perform the experiments in place of the test
   engineer. The whole process is designed as a stand-alone automated test
   bed which can run continuously and independently for days.},

Title = {Phishing Detection System Through Hybrid Machine Learning Based on URL},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {36805-36822},
Abstract = {Currently, numerous types of cybercrime are organized through the
   internet. Hence, this study mainly focuses on phishing attacks. Although
   phishing was first used in 1996, it has become the most severe and
   dangerous cybercrime on the internet. Phishing utilizes email distortion
   as its underlying mechanism for tricky correspondences, followed by mock
   sites, to obtain the required data from people in question. Different
   studies have presented their work on the precaution, identification, and
   knowledge of phishing attacks; however, there is currently no complete
   and proper solution for frustrating them. Therefore, machine learning
   plays a vital role in defending against cybercrimes involving phishing
   attacks. The proposed study is based on the phishing URL-based dataset
   extracted from the famous dataset repository, which consists of phishing
   and legitimate URL attributes collected from 11000+ website datasets in
   vector form. After preprocessing, many machine learning algorithms have
   been applied and designed to prevent phishing URLs and provide
   protection to the user. This study uses machine learning models such as
   decision tree (DT), linear regression (LR), random forest (RF), naive
   Bayes (NB), gradient boosting classifier (GBM), K-neighbors classifier
   (KNN), support vector classifier (SVC), and proposed hybrid LSD model,
   which is a combination of logistic regression, support vector machine,
   and decision tree (LR+SVC+DT) with soft and hard voting, to defend
   against phishing attacks with high accuracy and efficiency. The canopy
   feature selection technique with cross fold valoidation and Grid Search
   Hyperparameter Optimization techniques are used with proposed LSD model.
   Furthermore, to evaluate the proposed approach, different evaluation
   parameters were adopted, such as the precision, accuracy, recall,
   F1-score, and specificity, to illustrate the effects and efficiency of
   the models. The results of the comparative analyses demonstrate that the
   proposed approach outperforms the other models and achieves the best
   results.},

Abstract = {Although attachment theory claims that early attachment representations
   reflecting the quality of the child's lived experiences are maintained
   across developmental transitions, evidence that has emerged over the
   last decade suggests that the association between early relationship
   quality and adolescents' attachment representations is fairly modest in
   magnitude. We used aspects of parenting beyond sensitivity over
   childhood and adolescence and early security to predict adolescents'
   scripted attachment representations. At age 18years, 673 participants
   from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development completed
   the Attachment Script Assessment from which we derived an assessment of
   secure base script knowledge. Measures of secure base support from
   childhood through age 15years (e.g., parental monitoring of child
   activity, father presence in the home) were selected as predictors and
   accounted for an additional 8\% of the variance in secure base script
   knowledge scores above and beyond direct observations of sensitivity and
   early attachment status alone, suggesting that adolescents' scripted
   attachment representations reflect multiple domains of parenting.
   Cognitive and demographic variables also significantly increased
   predicted variance in secure base script knowledge by 2\% each.},

Abstract = {The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted family life
   around the world. Families had to adapt to teleworking and online
   learning to maintain young children's learning at home. During
   quarantine and nationwide school closures, parents of young children and
   children with disabilities had to act as teachers, therapists and
   caregivers. The role of parents gained relevance and it was needed to be
   able to guide their children to use technology during online learning.
   Digital resources provided an opportunity for children to keep learning,
   take part in games and keep in touch with their friends and teachers.
   But it increased access online brings heightened risks for children's
   safety, protection and privacy, so it is necessary that parents observe
   their children and support them. In this context, this paper presents
   the perception from parents about on the use of digital resources and
   techno-logical tools that teachers applied before and during pandemic.
   This study surveyed 773 Peruvian parents to know which of the resources
   used by teachers helped their children to understand the content of the
   course and which of tools allowed a better interaction with their
   classmates and teachers. According to the results of the survey, the
   most used resource before pandemic has been WhatsApp (32.1\%), followed
   by office tools (Word or Excel 20.3\%) and email (8.7\%). However, for
   carrying out online activities during the pandemic the most digital used
   resource by the teachers has been WhatsApp (29.9\%), then YouTube
   (17.6\%), Google Drive (16.7\%) and Google Docs. (7.9\%). Regarding to a
   good interaction to increase a better interaction between their
   classmates and teacher were Zoom (61.7\%), GoogleMeet (25.1\%) and
   WhatsApp (11.6\%). These results suggested that the use of digital
   resources and technological tools during the pandemic has been
   problematic and challenging for families.},

Title = {Have Live Viral Vaccine Practices Among the Pediatric Liver Transplant
   Community Changed? A Survey Study of Pediatric Liver Transplant Centers
   Across the United States},
Journal = {PEDIATRIC TRANSPLANTATION},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {29},
Number = {4},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {BackgroundExpanded data regarding the safety and immunogenicity of live
   viral vaccines (LVV) during the posttransplant period has resulted in
   updated recommendations endorsing LVVs for select pediatric liver
   transplant (LT) recipients, a significant change from historical
   guidelines. The goal of this survey study was to understand current LVV
   practices among pediatric LT centers.MethodsA 20-question email survey
   detailing center-specific pre- and post-LT LVV practices was distributed
   between May 1, 2024, and August 1, 2024, to a representative from each
   US center participating in the Society of Pediatric Liver
   Transplantation (SPLIT).ResultsThe overall survey response rate was 95\%
   (41/43 centers). In the pretransplant period, 85\% of centers (35/41)
   administer LVVs starting at 6 months of age, 7\% (3/41) wait until 9
   months, and another 7\% start at 12 months. The majority of centers
   (83\%, 34/41) require a 4-week interval between LVVs and active
   transplant listing. In the posttransplant period, 39\% of centers
   (16/41) never recommend LVVs, citing perceived limited safety data
   (63\%, 10/16) and inability to reach provider consensus (31\%, 5/16) as
   reasons. Among the 25 centers that offer LVVs, barriers faced in
   implementing LVV protocols include parental concerns about change from
   historical recommendation (48\%, 12/25) and parental concerns about
   safety/efficacy (36\%, 9/25).ConclusionsThe majority of pediatric LT
   centers across the US now recommend LVVs for select LT recipients.
   However, these centers face barriers in vaccinating all nonimmune
   eligible transplant recipients. Research is needed to understand and
   overcome barriers to widespread acceptance and implementation of
   evidence-based LVV recommendations.},

Title = {Phishlimiter: A Phishing Detection and Mitigation Approach Using
   Software-Defined Networking},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {42516-42531},
Abstract = {Phishing is one of the most harmful social engineering techniques to
   subdue end users where threat actors find a chance to gain access to
   critical information systems. A common approach in phishing is through
   the use of e-mail communication with an embedded hyperlink. The
   detection and mitigation of phishing attacks are a grand challenge due
   to the complexity of current phishing attacks. Existing techniques are
   often too time consuming to be used in the real world in terms of
   detection and mitigation time. Likewise, they employ static detection
   rules that are not effective in the real world due to the dynamics of
   phishing attacks. In this paper, we present PhishLimiter, a new
   detection and mitigation approach, where we first propose a new
   technique for deep packet inspection (DPI) and then leverage it with
   software-defined networking (SDN) to identify phishing activities
   through e-mail and web-based communication. The proposed DPI approach
   consists of two components: phishing signature classification and
   real-time DPI. Based on the programmability of SDN, we develop the store
   and forward mode and the forward and inspect mode to the direct network
   traffic by using an artificial neural network model to classify phishing
   attack signatures and design the real-time DPI so that PhishLimiter can
   flexibly address the dynamics of phishing attacks in the real world.
   PhishLimiter also provides better network traffic management for
   containing phishing attacks since it has the global view of a network
   through SDN. Furthermore, we evaluate PhishLimiter using a real-world
   testbed environment and data sets consisting of real-world email with
   embedded links. Our extensive experimental study shows that PhishLimiter
   provides an effective and efficient solution to deter malicious
   activities.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND NETWORK SECURITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {3},
Pages = {108-114},
Month = {MAR 30},
Abstract = {Internet users need reliable transmissions for web browsing, email, file
   transfer, and database access. TCP is the dominant reliable transport
   protocol on top of which all of these services run. Since TCP is
   originally developed to be used on the wired network, it safely assumes
   that segment losses are due to congestion. This is not true for wireless
   media where, due to fading channels and user mobility, transmission
   errors are more frequent. It unconditionally reduces its flow when a
   packet loss is detected, assuming that it has occurred because of
   congestion in the network. This incorrect assumption in case of a packet
   loss occurring due to channel noise, adversely affects the performance
   of TCP. This paper focuses on the same problem of TCP related to random
   errors causing packet loss. Treatment for losses should be different for
   corruption and congestion to improve efficiency. The proposed Composite
   TCP (CTCP) utilizes the SACK information available from a receiver along
   with round trip time to avoid flow control when the loss is because of a
   random error. The performance b of Composite TCP is compared and
   analyzed with existing variants over networks with exhaustive
   simulations using ns-2. Simulation results indicate that the proposed
   protocol significantly improves performance.},

Abstract = {With the proliferation of smart devices and widespread Internet
   connectivity, social sensing is advancing as a pervasive sensing
   paradigm where experiences shared by individuals on social platforms
   (e.g., Twitter and Facebook) are analyzed to interpret the physical
   world. In this article, we introduce CovidTrak, a vision of social
   intelligence-empowered contact tracing that aims to scrutinize the
   knowledge derived using social sensing to track Coronavirus Disease 2019
   (COVID-19) infections among the general public. Contact tracing is known
   to be an effective technique for detecting and monitoring persons who
   may have been exposed to individuals infected with any communicable
   disease. While a good number of contact tracing schemes are existent
   today (e.g., in-person and phone interviews, paper forms, email and
   web-based questionnaires, and smartphone apps), they often require
   active user participation and might miss certain cases of social
   interactions that go off-the-records but still lead to COVID-19
   transmission. By contrast, social sensing provides an alternative avenue
   for spontaneously determining such contacts by harnessing the rich
   experiences and information conveyed by people on social data platforms
   (e.g., a group photograph tweeted from a house party with a potential
   contact). As such, CovidTrak can form a powerful basis to combat the
   COVID-19 pandemic. The vision of CovidTrak intends to answer the
   following questions: 1) how to bolster the privacy and security of the
   online users while determining their contacts? 2) how to collect
   relevant social signals that indicate in-person encounters among people?
   3) how to reliably process the vast amount of noisy data from social
   platforms to identify chains of transmission? 4) how to handle the
   scarcity of location metadata in the incoming data? 5) how to
   effectively communicate crucial contact information to concerned
   individuals? and 6) how to model and handle the responses of the common
   people toward contact information? We envision unexplored opportunities
   to leverage multidisciplinary techniques to address the above questions
   and develop effective future CovidTrak schemes.},

Abstract = {COVID-19 is now impacting every country in Africa and healthcare workers
   (HCWs) across the continent remain susceptible to professional burnout.
   We designed a 43-question survey addressing multiple aspects of the
   COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was anonymous, distributed via email and
   phone messaging to 13 countries in Africa. We obtained 489 analyzable
   responses. 49\% off HCWs reported a decrease in income, with the
   majority experiencing between 1-25\% salary reduction. Sixty-six percent
   reported some access to personal protective equipment (PPE), 20\% had no
   access to PPE and only 14\% reported proper access. Strikingly, the
   percentage reporting never feeling depressed changed from 61\% before
   the pandemic to 31\% during the pandemic, with an increase in daily
   depression from 2\% to 20\%. We found no association between depression
   and change in income, household size, availability of PPE or lockdown.
   Safety concerns related to stigma from being HCWs affected 56\% of
   respondents.},

Title = {HOW OFTEN IS EMPLOYEE ANGER AN INSIDER RISK II? DETECTING AND MEASURING
   NEGATIVE SENTIMENT VERSUS INSIDER RISK IN DIGITAL
   COMMUNICATIONS-COMPARISON BETWEEN HUMAN RATERS AND PSYCHOLINGUISTIC
   SOFTWARE},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF DIGITAL FORENSICS SECURITY AND LAW},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Pages = {73-91},
Abstract = {This research uses two recently introduced observer rating scales, (Shaw
   et al., 2013) for the identification and measurement of negative
   sentiment (the Scale for Negativity in Text or SNIT) and insider risk
   (Scale of Indicators of Risk in Digital Communication or SIRDC) in
   communications to test the performance of psycholinguistic software
   designed to detect indicators of these risk factors. The
   psycholinguistic software program, WarmTouch (WT), previously used for
   investigations, appeared to be an effective means for locating
   communications scored High or Medium in negative sentiment by the SNIT
   or High in insider risk by the SIRDC within a randomly selected sample
   from the Enron archive. WT proved less effective in locating emails Low
   in negative sentiment on the SNIT and Low in insider risk on the SIRDC.
   However, WT performed extremely well in identifying communications from
   actual insiders randomly selected from case files and inserted in this
   email sample. In addition, it appeared that WT's measure of perceived
   Victimization was a significant supplement to using negative sentiment
   alone, when it came to searching for actual insiders. Previous findings
   (Shaw et al., 2013) indicate that this relative weakness in identifying
   low levels of negative sentiment may not impair WT's usefulness for
   identifying communications containing significant indications of insider
   risk because of the very low base rate and low severity of insider risk
   at Low levels of negative sentiment (Shaw et al., 2013). Although many
   of the ``false positives{''} acquired in the successful search for
   actual insiders in this experiment were shown to be true positives for
   other forms of insider risk, WT still produced fairly high rates of
   false positives that could burden analysts, as described by the search
   times provided. As further research and development proceeds to address
   this problem, we again recommend the use of WT in an integrated
   multi-disciplinary array of detection methods that will serve as an
   initial screen to narrow the search for individuals at-risk for insider
   activities. The implications for insider threat research, detection and
   prevention are discussed.},

Title = {ASHP national survey of pharmacy practice in hospital settings:
   Prescribing andtranscribing-2019},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH-SYSTEM PHARMACY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {77},
Number = {13},
Pages = {1026-1050},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Purpose. Results of the 2019 ASHP national survey of pharmacy practice
   in hospital settings are presented.
   Methods. Pharmacy directors at 4,863 general and children's
   medical/surgical hospitals in the United States were surveyed using a
   mixed-mode method of contact by email and mail. Survey completion was
   online, using an online survey application. IQVIA supplied data on
   hospital characteristics; the survey sample was drawn from the IMS
   Health hospital database.
   Results. The response rate was 10.8\%. Pharmacists are increasingly
   managing medication use in the areas of vancomycin therapy, antibiotic
   selection and dosing, and anticoagulation. Electronic health record
   (EHR) decision support is guiding prescribing, and nearly 50\% of
   hospitals are customizing drug warnings. Adoption of compounding
   technology continues, with 43.6\% of hospitals using technology in their
   sterile compounding processes. Nearly half of hospitals have active
   opioid stewardship programs, and pharmacists are leading these efforts.
   Specialty pharmacy operations are growing in health systems. Human
   resource commitments to support new services are increasing; however,
   vacancy rates for technicians are challenging. Staff credentialing
   continues to expand for pharmacist and technicians.
   Conclusion. Pharmacists continue to assume greater responsibility for
   writing medication orders, dosing, ordering laboratory tests, and
   monitoring outcomes. Health-system pharmacists are taking a leading role
   in addressing the opioid crisis, advancing safety in compounded sterile
   preparations through adoption of intravenous workflow technologies, and
   optimizing EHR applications to leverage clinical decision support tools
   to improve the safe prescribing and use of medications.},

Title = {Pre-Vaccination Care-Seeking in Females Reporting Severe Adverse
   Reactions to HPV Vaccine. A Registry Based Case-Control Study},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 9},
Abstract = {Background
   Since 2013 the number of suspected adverse reactions to the quadrivalent
   human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine reported to the Danish Medicines
   Agency (DMA) has increased. Due to the resulting public concerns about
   vaccine safety, the coverage of HPV vaccinations in the childhood
   vaccination programme has declined. The aim of the present study was to
   determine health care-seeking prior to the first HPV vaccination among
   females who suspected adverse reactions to HPV vaccine.
   Methods
   In this registry-based case-control study, we included as cases
   vaccinated females with reports to the DMA of suspected severe adverse
   reactions. We selected controls without reports of adverse reactions
   from the Danish vaccination registry and matched by year of vaccination,
   age of vaccination, and municipality, and obtained from the Danish
   National Patient Registry and The National Health Insurance Service
   Register the history of health care usage two years prior to the first
   vaccine. We analysed the data by logistic regression while adjusting for
   the matching variables.
   Results
   The study included 316 cases who received first HPV vaccine between 2006
   and 2014. Age range of cases was 11 to 52 years, with a peak at 12
   years, corresponding to the recommended age at vaccination, and another
   peak at 19 to 28 years, corresponding to a catch-up programme targeting
   young women. Compared with 163,910 controls, cases had increased
   care-seeking in the two years before receiving the first HPV vaccine. A
   multivariable model showed higher use of telephone/email consultations
   (OR 1.9; 95\% CI 1.2-3.2), physiotherapy (OR 2.1; 95\% CI 1.6-2.8) and
   psychologist/psychiatrist (OR 1.9; 95\% CI 1.3-2.7). Cases were more
   likely to have a diagnosis in the ICD-10 chapters of diseases of the
   digestive system (OR 1.6; 95\% CI 1.0-2.4), of the musculoskeletal
   system (OR 1.6; 95\% CI 1.1-2.2), symptoms or signs not classified
   elsewhere (OR 1.8; 95\% CI 1.3-2.5) as well as injuries (OR 1.5; 95\% CI
   1.2-1.9).
   Conclusion
   Before receiving the first HPV vaccination, females who suspected
   adverse reactions has symptoms and a health care-seeking pattern that is
   different from the matched population. Pre-vaccination morbidity should
   be taken into account in the evaluation of vaccine safety signals.},

Abstract = {Background: Idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD) is a rare
   lymphoproliferative disorder of unknown etiology with systemic symptoms
   that include fever, night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue. Although
   tocilizumab (TCZ), which is a recombinant, humanized, anti-human
   interleukin 6 receptor monoclonal antibody, has been recommended to
   treat patients with iMCD, 40\% of patients with iMCD do not achieve
   complete remission with TCZ treatment. Methods/Design: In this phase II,
   investigator-initiated, multicenter, double-blind, randomized,
   parallel-group trial, the efficacy and safety of sirolimus will be
   compared with placebo in patients with TCZ-resistant iMCD. The study
   will be conducted in 8 centers in Japan. Participants (n = 20) will be
   randomly assigned to receive 2 mg of oral sirolimus (n = 10) or placebo
   (n = 10) once daily for 16 weeks. The primary endpoint is a decrease in
   CHAP score by >= 1 from baseline at 16 weeks. Secondary endpoints
   include levels of hemoglobin, albumin, and C-reactive protein; change in
   CHAP score; SF-36 Health Survey Questionnaire; physician global
   assessment (100 mm visual analog scale); patient global assessment (100
   mm visual analog scale) at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks; change in
   lymphadenopathy at 16 weeks; and pharmacodynamic assessment, including
   the measurement of whole blood sirolimus level. Discussion: This
   clinical trial will provide evidence of efficacy and safety of sirolimus
   as a potential new therapeutic agent for patients with TCZ-resistant
   iMCD.},

   tool in the hands of national security and law enforcement agencies.
   This article examines Israel's attempt to balance these competing
   interests by empowering national security agencies while at the same
   time creating mechanisms for accountability. It describes the recent
   decision of Israel's Supreme Court to uphold the validity of the
   Communications Data Act, which was enacted in 2007 to provide law
   enforcement authorities with access to communications data, despite its
   infringement on the constitutional right to privacy.
   It explains how Israel utilizes the special independent status of the
   Attorney General as a check on government power.},

Title = {Knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards artificial intelligence
   among young pediatricians: A nationwide survey in France},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {DEC 23},
Abstract = {ObjectiveTo assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards
   artificial intelligence (AI) among young pediatricians in France.
   MethodsWe invited young French pediatricians to participate in an online
   survey. Invitees were identified through various email listings and
   social media. We conducted a descriptive analysis and explored whether
   survey responses varied according to respondents' previous training in
   AI and level of clinical experience (i.e., residents vs. experienced
   doctors). ResultsIn total, 165 French pediatricians participated in the
   study (median age 27 years, women 78\%, residents 64\%). While 90\% of
   participants declared they understood the term ``artificial
   intelligence{''}, only 40\% understood the term ``deep learning{''}.
   Most participants expected AI would lead to improvements in healthcare
   (e.g., better access to healthcare, 80\%; diagnostic assistance, 71\%),
   and 86\% declared they would favor implementing AI tools in pediatrics.
   Fifty-nine percent of respondents declared seeing AI as a threat to
   medical data security and 35\% as a threat to the ethical and human
   dimensions of medicine. Thirty-nine percent of respondents feared losing
   clinical skills because of AI, and 6\% feared losing their job because
   of AI. Only 5\% of respondents had received specific training in AI,
   while 87\% considered implementing such programs would be necessary.
   Respondents who received training in AI had significantly better
   knowledge and a higher probability of having encountered AI tools in
   their medical practice (p < 0.05 for both). There was no statistically
   significant difference between residents' and experienced doctors'
   responses. ConclusionIn this survey, most young French pediatricians had
   favorable views toward AI, but a large proportion expressed concerns
   regarding the ethical, societal, and professional issues linked with the
   implementation of AI.},

Title = {Using an Information Package to Reduce Patients' Risk of Renal Damage:
   Protocol for a Randomized Feasibility Trial},
Journal = {JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a common
   cause of renal damage, especially when taken together with
   angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i) or angiotensin II
   receptor blockers (ARBs) plus a diuretic - a combination known as the
   ``triple whammy.{''} New Zealand patients are at high risk of the
   ``triple whammy{''} because they can easily purchase NSAIDs without a
   prescription and in nonpharmacy retail settings (eg, the supermarket),
   there is no legal requirement to include patient information sheets with
   medication, and direct-to-consumer drug advertising is permitted. A
   patient information package has been developed for those at greatest
   risk of the ``triple whammy,{''} consisting of a printable PDF and an
   interactive online learning activity. This information package aims to
   inform patients about their elevated risk of harm from NSAIDS and
   discourage use of NSAIDs. A randomized control trial was planned to
   assess the effect of the information package.
   Objective: This study aims to pilot the trial procedures for recruiting
   patients and providing patient information online and to assess the
   acceptability of the patient information package.
   Methods: A two-armed randomized feasibility trial will be undertaken in
   Northland, New Zealand. We will recruit 50 patients who are at least 18
   years old from those who have signed up to receive email alerts through
   their general practice. Patients eligible for this study have been
   prescribed an ACE-i or ARB plus a diuretic in the past 3 months. They
   will be randomly allocated to 2 study arms. The intervention arm will
   receive access to an information package plus usual care; the control
   arm will receive usual care alone. Online surveys will be used to assess
   NSAID knowledge and NSAID use at baseline and after 2 weeks for both
   arms. The intervention arm will also evaluate the information package in
   an additional survey based on Normalization Process Theory (NPT)
   concepts. We will report the number and proportion of participants who
   are eligible and consent to participate in the trial. Response and
   drop-out rates will be reported for each trial arm. The numbers of
   patients who interact with the education package will be reported
   together with the patient evaluation of it.
   Results: Funding has been obtained from the Health Research Council of
   New Zealand (HRC 18-031). The University of Otago Human Research Ethics
   Committee (H21/016) has approved this trial. Consultation has been
   undertaken with The Ngai Tahu research consultation committee. The trial
   commenced on April 12, 2021.
   Conclusions: This feasibility trial will test the study processes prior
   to commencing a randomized controlled trial and will determine the
   acceptability of the patient information package. We anticipate this
   work will provide useful information for other researchers attempting
   similar work.},

Abstract = {Recently, a novel spreading based non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)
   scheme named coded tandem spreading multiple access (CTSMA) is proposed
   for grant-free random access in massive machine-type communications
   (mMTC). In CTSMA, high collision resolution probability for the massive
   machine devices is achieved at the expense of user data rate. However,
   previous CTSMA literature assume synchronous arrivals of the data
   packets from different user devices. To this end, the chip-level
   asynchronicity of CTSMA is tackled in this paper with interleaving and
   spreading sequence design. Moreover, uplink channel estimation of CTSMA
   is considered in this work. The simulation results evaluate the
   effectiveness of the improved CTSMA scheme.},

Title = {Cultural Change, Slow and Fast: The Distinctive Trajectory of Norms

Pages = {1313-1340},

Abstract = {This article builds on research demonstrating that high levels of
   economic and physical security are conducive to a shift from materialist
   to postmaterialist values-and that this shift tends to make people more
   favorable to important social changes. This article updates this
   research, demonstrating that: (1) These value changes occur with
   exceptionally large time lags between the onset of the conditions
   conducive to them, and the societal changes they produce-as previous
   work implies but does not demonstrate. The evidence suggests that there
   was a time lag of forty to fifty years between when Western societies
   first attained high levels of economic and physical security after World
   War II, and related societal changes such as legalization of same-sex
   marriage. (2) A distinctive set of ``individual-choice norms,{''}
   dealing with acceptance of gender equality, divorce, abortion, and
   homosexuality, is moving on a different trajectory from other cultural
   changes. These norms are closely linked with human fertility rates and
   require severe self-repression. (3) Although basic values normally
   change at the pace of intergenerational population replacement, the
   shift from pro-fertility norms to individual-choice norms is now moving
   much faster, having reached a tipping point where conformist pressures
   have reversed polarity and are now accelerating changes they once
   resisted. We test these claims against data from eighty countries
   containing most of the world's population, surveyed from 1981 to 2014.},

Title = {Development of Low Cost Rapid Fabrication of Sharp Polymer Microneedles
   for In Vivo Glucose Biosensing Applications},
Journal = {ECS JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {4},

Abstract = {New approaches to enable more effective management of diabetes mellitus,
   such as continuous glucose monitoring are being developed both to
   prevent unstable episodes of hypo or hyper glycaemia and also to provide
   an improved user experience. One emerging approach to realize these
   requirements is to fabricate a minimally invasive transdermal sensor for
   the direct in vivo detection of glucose in the interstitial fluid.
   Microneedles - sharp, microscopic structures measuring less than 1 mm in
   length - have been previously employed to allow painless penetration of
   the stratum corneum for delivery of drugs and vaccines. In this work we
   present, ultra sharp gold coated polymer microneedle arrays (sub micron
   tip radii) which are fabricated using a low cost polymer replication
   approach. Critical dimensions of the microneedle arrays are
   characterized using a combination of optical and scanning electron
   microscopies. Fabricated microneedle devices are characterized by cyclic
   voltammetry to explore functionality. The voltammetric detection of
   glucose is performed using ferrocene monocarboxylic acid as an oxidising
   mediator in the presence of glucose oxidase. The biosensor can be
   applied to the quantification of glucose in the physiological range (2 -
   13.5 mM). The sensors demonstrate high selectivity towards glucose with
   negligible interference from other oxidizable species including uric
   acid, ascorbic acid, mannose, fructose, salicylic acid (Aspirin) and
   acetaminophen (Paracetamol). This demonstrates potential future use of
   these microneedle devices for in vivo glucose detection.

Abstract = {Internet-based health research is increasing, and often offers financial
   incentives but fraudulent behavior by participants can result.
   Specifically, eligible or ineligible individuals may enter the study
   multiple times and receive undeserved financial compensation. We review
   past experiences and approaches to this problem and propose several new
   strategies. Researchers can detect and prevent Internet research fraud
   in four broad ways: (1) through the questionnaire/instrument (e.g.,
   including certain questions in survey; and software for administering
   survey); (2) through participants' non-questionnaire data and seeking
   external validation (e.g., checking data for same email addresses,
   usernames, passwords, and/or fake addresses or phone numbers; (3)
   through computer information, (e.g., IP addresses and cookies), and 4)
   through study design (e.g., avoid lump sum compensation and interviewing
   participants). These approaches each have pros and cons, and raise
   ethical, legal, and logistical questions, given that ethical tensions
   can emerge between preserving the integrity of research vs. protecting
   the privacy and confidentiality of study respondents. While past
   discussions concerning the ethics of online research have tended to
   focus on the participants' ability to trust the researchers, needs now
   arise to examine researchers' abilities to trust the participants. This
   analysis has several critical implications for future practice, policy,
   and research.},

Abstract = {By using traffic analysis attacks, attackers track users' network
   traffic and analyze user behaviors, such as visited websites and online
   activities. Users' personal privacy is at risk. Traffic obfuscation is a
   new way to protect privacy. Traffic obfuscation is commonly used in
   censory-circumvention systems to help Internet users bypass online
   censorship, but recent work has used it to disguise user traffic to
   evade adversary attacks. However, the current traffic obfuscation
   methods and rules are relatively simple, can not dynamically adapt to
   the network environment, and lack of uniform traffic feature similarity
   evaluation index. In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial
   network(GAN) model based on temporal convolutional network(TCN). TCN-GAN
   learns traffic features to achieve the purpose of disguising specific
   traffic as target traffic. At the same time, we provide the Measurement
   of Indiscernibility(MoI) for evaluating the difference between generated
   traffic features and real traffic features. Compared with the existing
   work, our experimental results show that in machine learning-based
   traffic analysis attacks, TCN-GAN has better performance on sample
   quality and mimicry effect, and MoI can be used as an effective index to
   evaluate the model generation effect.},

Journal = {SUBSTANCE ABUSE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {43},

Abstract = {Background: Opioid overdose is a preventable injury leading to high
   morbidity and premature mortality in communities across the United
   States. Overdoses take place where people use drugs, including
   commercial and public locations like community pharmacies, and
   necessitate swift detection and response to avoid harm and, even more
   seriously, death. The presence of emergency and safety protocols
   improves occupational health and safety for all in the workplace. The
   aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of experience with
   on-site pharmacy overdose and to explore pharmacist and site
   characteristics associated with having a known protocol for responding
   to on-site overdose emergencies. Methods: An anonymous, online survey
   about naloxone provision and opioid safety was delivered by email,
   through professional pharmacy associations and continuing education
   attendance lists, to 3,100 pharmacists in Massachusetts and Rhode Island
   between October 2017 and January 2018. Survey items gauged
   socio-demographics, practice site characteristics, safer opioid
   dispensing and naloxone provision. Summary statistics and bivariate
   analyses were conducted to describe characteristics associated with
   items pertaining to on-site overdose policy awareness. Results: Of the
   357 respondents (11.5\% response rate), 154 (5.0\%) answered the
   questions of interest: 17.5\% reported having at least one suspected
   overdose on-site at their practice location, while 42.9\% reported that
   they were knowledgeable about and could locate at their practice
   location an on-site overdose protocol detailing how to respond to an
   overdose. Pharmacists who were knowledgeable about protocols were also
   more likely to offer naloxone to patients (p = 0.02) and did not
   practice at a chain pharmacy (p = 0.01). Conclusions: Community
   pharmacies that stock and distribute naloxone are key parts of community
   efforts to address the opioid crisis. Pharmacies and other healthcare
   settings should develop and implement on-site overdose response
   protocols and cultivate a norm of naloxone provision to patients.},

Title = {Knowing is Half the Battle: The Factors Leading to Efficient Recruitment
   of Representative Samples in Schizophrenia Research},
Journal = {PHARMACEUTICAL MEDICINE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {39},
Number = {1},
Pages = {29-38},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background and ObjectivesDrug development in schizophrenia is limited by
   the differential scaling of the active treatment and placebo arms of a
   study, such that, as the number of sites increases, the magnitude of
   placebo response disproportionately increases. The objective of this
   article was to identify factors conducive to efficient recruitment as a
   step towards trial designs allowing recruitment of more participants per
   site, leading to reduced variability, and potentially a smaller placebo
   effect.Patients and MethodsUsing the information of 554 individuals, we
   calculated the percentage of individuals who were screened, consented,
   and retained in our research, along with rationale for nonconsent.
   Independent t tests and Chi-squared tests were performed to compare
   participant characteristics.ResultsOut of the 273 individuals who were
   fully screened, 84 did not progress to the consented stage owing to
   various reasons, leading to a total of 189 individuals who were screened
   and consented and a total of 365 individuals who were either
   incompletely screened or not consented into a study. Individuals with an
   externally validated medical history showed the highest yield in being
   consented and retained in research as new participants. In particular,
   chart reviews from clinics were highly efficient (25.8\%) in
   facilitating new participants' enrollment, even when these individuals
   were not actively/prospectively seeking research. The most common reason
   for nonconsent was difficulty in telephone or email contact. Consenting
   and nonconsenting participants were similar in demographics, and
   recruitment sources only differed in their reported substance
   use.ConclusionsReferrals and chart reviews from known clinics were the
   most efficient method in retaining new participants, highlighting the
   importance of external validation and communication between research and
   clinical staff within a system. Consenting participants showed no
   significant differences from the database as a whole, demonstrating that
   the study samples were representative. Future studies should aim to
   confirm the present findings at other academic and commercial research
   centers.},

Title = {Measuring what counts in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander care: a
   review of general practice datasets available for assessing chronic
   disease care},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PRIMARY HEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {30},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Background Large datasets exist in Australia that make de-identified
   primary healthcare data extracted from clinical information systems
   available for research use. This study reviews these datasets for their
   capacity to provide insight into chronic disease care for Aboriginal and
   Torres Strait Islander peoples, and the extent to which the principles
   of Indigenous Data Sovereignty are reflected in data collection and
   governance arrangements.Methods Datasets were included if they collect
   primary healthcare clinical information system data, collect data
   nationally, and capture Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.
   We searched PubMed and the public Internet for data providers meeting
   the inclusion criteria. We developed a framework to assess data
   providers across domains, including representativeness, usability, data
   quality, adherence with Indigenous Data Sovereignty and their capacity
   to provide insights into chronic disease. Datasets were assessed against
   the framework based on email interviews and publicly available
   information.Results We identified seven datasets. Only two datasets
   reported on chronic disease, collected data nationally and captured a
   substantial number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients. No
   dataset was identified that captured a significant number of both
   mainstream general practice clinics and Aboriginal Community Controlled
   Health Organisations.Conclusions It is critical that more accurate,
   comprehensive and culturally meaningful Aboriginal and Torres Strait
   Islander healthcare data are collected. These improvements must be
   guided by the principles of Indigenous Data Sovereignty and Governance.
   Validated and appropriate chronic disease indicators for Aboriginal and
   Torres Strait Islander peoples must be developed, including indicators
   of social and cultural determinants of health.
   Considerable data are collected on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
   peoples, extracted from primary healthcare services. We reviewed these
   datasets for their capacity to provide insight into chronic disease care
   for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Most data providers
   have the potential capability to capture detailed indicators across many
   chronic diseases. It is critical that more accurate, comprehensive, and
   culturally meaningful Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander healthcare
   data are collected to support evidence-based policy.},

Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to collaborate with a community
   partner to administer a current needs assessment of persons with
   epilepsy (PWE) and determine the types of resources that PWE would like
   to access through the community partner.
   Methods: A self-report needs assessment survey was administered to
   caregivers and PWE across the state of South Carolina during a community
   partner educational workshop in 20) and via secure software distributed
   through an email link 54).
   Key findings: The most frequently reported challenges (>50\%) were
   concerns about finding time to participate in epilepsy community
   activities, the personal safety of the PWE, finding social connections
   or social support, finding mental or behavioral health services,and work
   concerns. However, top ranked concerns centered on personal safety
   (27.8\%), lack of insurance/not enough money to pay for epilepsy
   treatment (15.3\%), and difficulty with daily management of epilepsy
   (13.9\%). Participants reported likely engagement with the epilepsy
   community partner via in-person meetings, over the phone, and through
   social media contacts; however, there were differences between PWE and
   caregivers regarding preferences for communication. Almost 60\% endorsed
   that they would likely participate in a brief program to learn skills to
   manage their epilepsy daily.
   Significance: Persons with epilepsy in South Carolina continue to have
   many unmet needs and would access resources, if available, from a
   state-wide epilepsy community partner via various modes of
   communication. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {New `omics' technologies are changing nutritional sciences research.
   They enable to tackle increasingly complex questions but also increase
   the need for collaboration between research groups. An important
   challenge for successful collaboration is the management and structured
   exchange of information that accompanies data-intense technologies.
   NuGO, the European Nutrigenomics Organization, the major collaborating
   network in molecular nutritional sciences, is supporting the application
   of modern information technologies in this area. We have developed and
   implemented a concept for data management and computing infrastructure
   that supports collaboration between nutrigenomics researchers. The
   system fills the gap between ``private{''} storing with occasional file
   sharing by email and the use of centralized databases. It provides
   flexible tools to share data, also during experiments, while preserving
   ownership. The NuGO Information Network is a decentral, distributed
   system for data exchange based on standard web technology. Secure access
   to data, maintained by the individual researcher, is enabled by web
   services based on the the BioMoby framework. A central directory
   provides information about available web services. The flexibility of
   the infrastructure allows a wide variety of services for data processing
   and integration by combining several web services, including public
   services. Therefore, this integrated information system is suited for
   other research collaborations.},

Title = {Service source and channel choice in G2C service environments: a model
   comparison in the anti/counter-terrorism domain},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Pages = {313-341},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This paper compares the relative advantages of two models (a) a
   two-factor (i.e. source and channel) choice model; and (b) a theory of
   planned behaviour (TPB)based acceptance model, developed to explain
   electronic government (e-government) service adoption. The models were
   empirically validated in the government-to-citizen (G2C)
   anti/counter-terrorism (ACT) service domain by a telephone survey
   administered to a sample of 500 US residents systematically drawn from
   the mainland USA. The structured telephone survey questionnaire measured
   respondents' intentions to use Web-based ACT services and their beliefs
   and attitudes towards various ACT service providers (e.g. the Federal
   Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security, local police,
   non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and news companies) and media
   (e.g. Web, email, telephone, TV, newspapers, postal mail). The results
   of multiple-regression analysis of the 500 interview responses show that
   the sourcechannel choice model can explain the service usage intentions
   as well as, or better than, the TPB-based acceptance model. Both service
   source and channel exerted consistent and substantive effects on
   citizens' intention to use ACT services, explaining, on average, more
   than 43\% of variance in the dependent variable. In contrast, subjective
   norms in the TPB-based model seemed to have a marginal effect. Privacy
   protection and integrity of the service source appeared to be key
   antecedents of source preference, while the influence of channel
   attributes on channel preference varied widely depending on the type of
   services. This study provides an empirical basis for the validity and
   applicability of the sourcechannel choice model and offers insightful
   and prescriptive knowledge for e-government initiatives and service
   providers.},

Title = {Identifying forms of after-hours information communication technology
   use and their role in psychological detachment: An episodic approach},
Journal = {HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {63},
Number = {6},
Pages = {919-937},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Employees increasingly conduct work outside of traditional work hours
   via information communication technologies (ICTs). There is a need to
   understand how after-hours ICT use relates to well-being, given that
   such connectivity has become unavoidable. We implement an episodic,
   event-contingent design to evaluate the association between different
   ICT media (i.e., e-mail, phone call, chat app, short message service)
   and the within-person outcomes of psychological detachment as partially
   mediated by task productivity. A daily diary survey was collected over
   three consecutive workdays to capture after-hours ICT use. Daily surveys
   were completed by 498 individuals, with a total of 1494 episodes being
   captured of after-hours work ICT engagement. Our results indicate that
   while engagement with any form of ICT after hours reduces psychological
   detachment, email and chat apps are associated with the lowest levels of
   psychological detachment. Moreover, whereas the use of asynchronous ICT
   has positive main effects on episode-related task productivity, the use
   of synchronous ICT (e.g., phone) only enhances episode-related task
   productivity when there are high organizational expectations for
   employees' responsiveness after hours.},

Title = {Information Technology and generating business value: An analysis in
   industrial SMEs},
Journal = {INTANGIBLE CAPITAL},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Pages = {639-663},
Abstract = {Purpose: The literature examines the relationship between information
   technologies and business results mainly through direct relationship
   between investment on Information Technologies (IT) and financial
   measures. This has resulted in disparity of results and lack of
   consensus, and therefore, the necessity to deepen this topic. In this
   sense, this paper aims to analyze in industrial SMEs the effects of the
   use of IT on different financial and non-financial variables related to
   business value.
   Design/methodology: The work follows the classical research scheme with
   literature review, statement of hypotheses and application of
   quantitative empirical methodology, collecting information through
   questionnaires sent by email, for further processing and statistical
   testing using ANOVA models, which allow get results and conclusions.
   Findings: The study provides an approach beyond classical search of
   direct relationship between IT investment and financial measures, using
   instead as an explanatory variable the ``use of IT{''} and as explained
   variables the Balance scorecard dimensions, which considers the
   financial ones and introduces other more qualitative as customers, human
   resources and internal processes. The obtained results show that IT
   contributes to the generation of value not only through the
   profitability but also other more qualitative factors.
   Research limitations/implications: The sample size (85 companies)
   complicates the extrapolation of results. In addition, in the future it
   would be appropriate to consider new technological developments like
   Cloud computing, along with variables such as information security and
   its impact on value creation.
   Originality/value: This work shows that to analyze the generated value
   by IT it must to be considered financial and non-financial variables.
   The proposed approach, variables and scales complement traditional
   approaches and can guide future research as well as companies who want
   to generate their own self-assessment system.},

Title = {Use \& Abuse of Personal Information, Part II: Robust Generation of Fake
   IDs for Privacy Experimentation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {4},
Number = {3},
Pages = {546-571},
Month = {AUG 11},
Abstract = {When personal information is shared across the Internet, we have limited
   confidence that the designated second party will safeguard it as we
   would prefer. Privacy policies offer insight into the best practices and
   intent of the organization, yet most are written so loosely that sharing
   with undefined third parties is to be anticipated. Tracking these
   sharing behaviors and identifying the source of unwanted content is
   exceedingly difficult when personal information is shared with multiple
   such second parties. This paper formulates a model for realistic fake
   identities, constructs a robust fake identity generator, and outlines
   management methods targeted towards online transactions (email, phone,
   text) that pass both cursory machine and human examination for use in
   personal privacy experimentation. This fake ID generator, combined with
   a custom account signup engine, are the core front-end components of our
   larger Use and Abuse of Personal Information system that performs
   one-time transactions that, similar to a cryptographic one-time pad,
   ensure that we can attribute the sharing back to the single one-time
   transaction and/or specific second party. The flexibility and richness
   of the fake IDs also serve as a foundational set of control variables
   for a wide range of social science research questions revolving around
   personal information. Collectively, these fake identity models address
   multiple inter-disciplinary areas of common interest and serve as a
   foundation for eliciting and quantifying personal information-sharing
   behaviors.},

Title = {Popularity of Online Multimedia Educational Resources in Neurosurgery:
   Insights from The Neurosurgical  Atlas Project},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {75},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1615-1623},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The Neurosurgical Atlas is a popular world-wide multimedia
   website in neurosurgery with informative chapters and videos to promote
   excellence and safety in neurosurgical techniques. Here, we present our
   analysis of the viewing data of this website. This is intended to
   describe how online neurosurgical resources are being utilized by
   today's neurosurgical community. We hope this will be a useful guide for
   neurosurgeons interested in online multimedia education.
   DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed Google Analytics and Vimeo data
   collected from The Neurosurgical Atlas between June 2016 and August
   2017, which tracked user demographics, geographical location, and the
   videos watched. Views were also analyzed categorically by dividing
   videos into 6 neurosurgical topics and into basic and advanced levels as
   per their surgical complexity.
   RESULTS: During the study period, there were 246,259 website visits and
   143,868 video plays. The most frequent age group seen was 25 to 34
   (44\%), followed by 35 to 44 (24\%), and 71\% of visitors were male.
   Most website visits were from the United States (29.52\%) followed by
   Brazil (6.43\%). There was a steady increase in website visits and video
   plays over time, with multiple peaks corresponding to promotional email
   updates. The 6 neurosurgical topics were all similarly popular in video
   plays, with the general neurosurgical topics being slightly preferred.
   Similarly, basic and advanced topics were both viewed frequently, with a
   slight preference for the basic topics.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study presents the first piece of evidence
   demonstrating the feasibility and popularity of a free online resource
   in neurosurgical education. Our experience highlights the growing demand
   for free-access online chapters, anatomical illustrations, and operative
   videos. This initiative should not stop with The Neurosurgical Atlas;
   other surgeons should feel encouraged to employ similar methods to
   disseminate and advance surgical education. ((C) 2018 Association of

Abstract = {Over the past decade, many Governments have moved towards providing
   services to their citizens via the web, with varying degrees of success.
   This paper reports on research concerning the transition from
   eGovernment to mobile government (m-Government). This research
   contributes to the field by developing a successful m-Government
   framework as a basis for a transition methodology, either from
   eGovernment to m-Government or directly to m-Government. Transitioning
   from eGovernment to m-Government requires an investigation of the
   integration process between eGovernment and m-Government. We need to
   examine all the pressures and obstacles that hinder the transition
   process, as well as those that determine m-Government success factors.
   Such obstacles and success factors differ between nations, such as a
   nation's technological and information infrastructure, mobile device
   penetration and acceptance, public and social pressures, and security.
   Finally an m-Government initiative is required. Yet mobile government,
   despite its potential, has not reached anticipated adoption levels. The
   main aim of this study is to discover what is needed to improve the
   adoption and implementation of mobile government systems. Specific
   objectives proposed to achieve this aim include: a) identifying all the
   factors that may influence the adoption and implementation of mobile
   services, b) integrating such factors and relations between them in a
   framework, and c) providing specific recommendations and guidelines in
   all the various perspectives. Case Studies was the methodology employed
   to fulfil these objectives. A qualitative approach was found to be most
   suitable to this study, and open ended Web survey questions, as well as
   various kinds of interviews, including email, face-to-face, and phone,
   were used to obtain detailed, in-depth information from industry and
   user participants. A total of nine such studies were carried out in
   Australia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan. Interviews were recorded
   and transcribed, and all the material was analysed using nVivo, a
   qualitative data analysis (QDA) computer software package. The final
   contribution of this study is an adaptive theoretical framework that
   explains the specific factors that influence the adoption, diffusion and
   implementation of mobile government systems.},

Title = {How to block Tor's hidden bridges: detecting methods and countermeasures},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {66},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1285-1305},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Tor network has been widely used for protecting the privacy of users
   while accessing various online services. Since Tor can be easily blocked
   by blacklisting the publicly published Tor relays, the hidden
   bridges-based blocking-resistance mechanism is designed and implemented
   in the current Tor network. Any user can subscribe a tuple of three
   bridges via email, https, twitter etc. However, we have found that there
   exist high correlations among those published tuples, which can be
   exploited to effectively detect hidden bridges by monitoring the
   outbound traffic from a controlled network. When Tor clients try to
   connect chosen hidden bridges, multiple SYN packets with consecutive
   source ports will be sent almost simultaneously, destining for different
   hosts. If any destination IP contained among such packets belongs to a
   known bridge, all others can then be inferred to be of bridges too. By
   recording and analyzing a series of traffic segments satisfying the
   above packet features, the hidden bridges used in a controlled network
   can be detected and further blocked. According to different available
   computing and storage resources, we proposed both online and offline
   detecting methods. Both analytical and simulation results verify the
   high correlation among published bridge tuples, validating the
   feasibility of our methods. By configuring optimized detecting
   parameters in the real-world experiments, we can achieve a detection
   rate of 86.7 \% with a 0.85 \% false-positive rate for online detection,
   and a 98.4 \% detection rate with a 0.62 \% false-positive rate for
   offline detection. To make up the flaws in Tor's current
   blocking-resistance mechanism, we also provide some countermeasures from
   the perspective of Tor network and users, respectively.},

Abstract = {A robust body of literature documents how women manage their
   self-presentation and perceptions of sexual risk when navigating city
   spaces. Yet we know less about how these strategies and tactics interact
   with existing class relations in society. This study investigates how,
   in the metropolitan city of Hyderabad in India, upwardly mobile women
   who commute via ride-share apps and lower-class men employed as drivers
   navigate the temporarily shared space of the car ride within the broader
   context of growing public anxiety around women's safety in the city.
   Drawing on interview data and participant observation, I show two
   empirical patterns: 1) women commuters and men cabdrivers each view the
   other through the lens of suspicion as relatively more powerful than
   themselves; and 2) while women construct men drivers as sexually
   rapacious and dangerous, men understand the upwardly mobile woman
   commuter as entitled and abusive of her class power. I argue that
   competing understandings of risk exacerbate social distance and
   reproduce class and gender hierarchies between men drivers and women
   commuters. I suggest that the desire for safety vocalized by women
   passengers, while understandable, seems to rest on a set of processes
   that further pathologize and ``otherize{''} the lower-class male

Title = {A community divided: Post-transplant live vaccine practices among
   Society of Pediatric Liver Transplantation (SPLIT) centers},
Journal = {PEDIATRIC TRANSPLANTATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {24},
Number = {7},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background Historically, the IDSA and the AST have recommended that live
   vaccines not be administered post-transplant due to concern for
   induction of vaccine-strain disease in immunocompromised hosts. However,
   recent prospective studies and revised AST guidelines published in April
   2019 suggest that in the current era of immunosuppression minimization,
   live vaccines may be safely administered to select transplant recipients
   with resulting immunoprotection. The goal of this study was to assess
   current post-transplant live vaccine practices at individual pediatric
   liver transplant centers following the updated AST guidelines. Methods A
   six-item email survey detailing center-specific post-transplant live
   vaccine practices followed by up to three response-specific questions
   were distributed between July 2019 and May 2020 to a representative from
   each center participating in the SPLIT consortium. Results The overall
   survey response rate was 93\% (41/44 centers). Only 29\% (12/41) of
   centers offer live vaccines post-transplant; each of these 12 centers
   uses different eligibility criteria for live vaccines. There was no
   difference between large (ten or more transplants per year) and small
   (less than ten transplants per year) centers in likelihood to offer live
   vaccines post-transplant. The main reasons for a center not offering
   post-transplant live vaccines were safety concerns and inability to
   reach group consensus. Conclusions The majority of pediatric liver
   transplant centers are reluctant to offer live vaccines post-transplant
   despite the updated AST guidelines. Prospective multicenter studies are
   needed to confirm safety and immunogenicity of live vaccines
   post-transplant.},

Title = {Mobile phone messaging for facilitating self-management of long-term
   illnesses},
Journal = {COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS},
Year = {2012},
Number = {12},
Abstract = {Background
   Long-term illnesses affect a significant proportion of the population in
   developed and developing countries. Mobile phone messaging applications,
   such as Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia Message Service
   (MMS), may present convenient, cost-effective ways of supporting
   self-management and improving patients' self-efficacy skills through,
   for instance, medication reminders, therapy adjustments or supportive
   messages.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects of mobile phone messaging applications designed to
   facilitate self-management of long-term illnesses, in terms of impact on
   health outcomes and patients' capacity to self-manage their condition.
   Secondary objectives include assessment of: user evaluation of the
   intervention; health service utilisation and costs; and possible risks
   and harms associated with the intervention.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL,
   The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to
   June 2009), EMBASE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), PsycINFO
   (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (January 1993
   to June 2009), LILACS (January 1993 to June 2009) and African Health
   Anthology (January 1993 to June 2009). We also reviewed grey literature
   (including trial registers) and reference lists of articles.
   Selection criteria
   We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised
   controlled trials (QRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, or
   interrupted time series (ITS) studies with at least three time points
   before and after the intervention. We selected only studies where it was
   possible to assess the effects of mobile phone messaging independent of
   other technologies or interventions.
   Data collection and analysis
   wo review authors independently assessed all studies against the
   inclusion criteria, with any disagreements resolved by a third review
   author. Study design features, characteristics of target populations,
   interventions and controls, and results data were extracted by two
   review authors and confirmed by a third. Primary outcomes of interest
   were health outcomes as a result of the intervention and capacity to
   self-manage long-term conditions. We also considered patients' and
   providers' evaluation of the intervention, perceptions of safety, health
   service utilisation and costs, and potential harms or adverse effects.
   The included studies were heterogeneous in type of condition addressed,
   intervention characteristics and outcome measures. Therefore, a
   meta-analysis to derive an overall effect size for the main outcome
   categories was not considered justified and findings are presented
   narratively.
   Main results
   We included four randomised controlled trials involving 182
   participants.
   For the primary outcome of health outcomes, including physiological
   measures, there is moderate quality evidence from two studies involving
   people with diabetes showing no statistical difference from text
   messaging interventions compared with usual care or email reminders for
   glycaemic control (HbA1c), the frequency of diabetic complications, or
   body weight. There is moderate quality evidence from one study of
   hypertensive patients that the mean blood pressure and the proportion of
   patients who achieved blood pressure control were not significantly
   different in the intervention and control groups, and that there was no
   statistically significant difference in mean body weight between the
   groups. There is moderate quality evidence from one study that asthma
   patients receiving a text messaging intervention experienced greater
   improvements on peak expiratory flow variability (mean difference (MD)
   -11.12, 95\% confidence interval (CI) -19.56 to -2.68) and the pooled
   symptom score comprising four items (cough, night symptoms, sleep
   quality, and maximum tolerated activity) (MD -0.36, 95\% CI -0.56 to
   -0.17) compared with the control group. However, the study found no
   significant differences between the groups in impact on forced vital
   capacity or forced expiratory flow in 1 second.
   For the primary outcome of capacity to self-manage the condition, there
   is moderate quality evidence from one study that diabetes patients
   receiving the text messaging intervention demonstrated improved scores
   on measures of self-management capacity (Self-Efficacy for Diabetes
   score (MD 6.10, 95\% CI 0.45 to 11.75), Diabetes Social Support
   Interview pooled score (MD 4.39, 95\% CI 2.85 to 5.92)), but did not
   show improved knowledge of diabetes. There is moderate quality evidence
   from three studies of the effects on treatment compliance. One study
   showed an increase in hypertensive patients' rates of medication
   compliance in the intervention group (MD 8.90, 95\% CI 0.18 to 17.62)
   compared with the control group, but in another study there was no
   statistically significant effect on rates of compliance with peak
   expiratory flow measurement in asthma patients. Text message prompts for
   diabetic patients initially also resulted in a higher number of blood
   glucose results sent back (46.0) than email prompts did (23.5).
   For the secondary outcome of participants' evaluation of the
   intervention, there is very low quality evidence from two studies that
   patients receiving mobile phone messaging support reported perceived
   improvement in diabetes self-management, wanted to continue receiving
   messages, and preferred mobile phone messaging to email as a method to
   access a computerised reminder system.
   For the secondary outcome of health service utilisation, there is very
   low quality evidence from two studies. Diabetes patients receiving text
   messaging support made a comparable number of clinic visits and calls to
   an emergency hotline as patients without the support. For asthma
   patients the total number of office visits was higher in the text
   messaging group, whereas the number of hospital admissions was higher
   for the control group.
   Because of the small number of trials included, and the low overall
   number of participants, for any of the reviewed outcomes the quality of
   the evidence can at best be considered moderate.
   Authors' conclusions
   We found some, albeit very limited, indications that in certain cases
   mobile phone messaging interventions may provide benefit in supporting
   the self-management of long-term illnesses. However, there are
   significant information gaps regarding the long-term effects,
   acceptability, costs, and risks of such interventions. Given the
   enthusiasm with which so-called mHealth interventions are currently
   being implemented, further research into these issues is needed.},

Abstract = {The open source software movement has been going on for a few decades
   now. Today, an increasing number of open source solutions enter the
   market and become valid alternatives to proprietary and closed
   solutions. Examples include operating systems like Linux and
   OpenSolaris, back-end solutions (e.g. LAMP - Linux, Apache web server,
   MySQL database, and Perl/PHP/Python programming languages - are among
   the most well-known and widely used open source software on the
   Internet), office applications (e.g. Firefox web browser, Thunderbird
   email, GIMP graphics, OpenOffice office suite), and complete enterprise
   systems like Compiere (ERP and CRM) and Mambo content management system
   (CMS). In addition, a variety of devices increasingly include open
   source (e.g. cellular phones, network equipment like routers, and
   Asterisk - a complete IP PBX).
   The open source culture is about much more than software and includes
   open source hardware, views on intellectual properties rights,
   completely changes how products are developed and owned, and how
   business models are developed.
   To decide if open source is something for you, a good understanding of
   what open source really means is necessary. This includes legal aspects
   (different licenses), availability of support with (hopefully a
   thriving) user community and commercial for-pay support options, and
   security.
   Intellectual properties rights, and the vast number of many types of
   open source licenses (e.g. GNU General Public License (GPL) and BSD
   License), is one of the more complex areas when using open source. What
   can and not can be done, what must be done, and so on, vary between
   licenses. One effort to bring some order in all this is the Open Source
   Definition (OSD) from Open Source Initiative (OSI) which lists ten
   conditions that must be met for an OSI Certified open source license.
   Today, many companies have already been forced to either remove or
   release as open source code borrowed by developers without properly
   complying with licenses. Such ``dirty code{''} is increasingly easy to
   detect via compliance tools used by companies doing this as business.
   (Not to mention whistle-blowing employees tipping of property owners.)
   Searching for dirty code is also increasingly part of due diligence in
   mergers and acquisitions and can add costly delays and lawsuits.
   The perceived low cost is often a reason for considering open source
   solutions but the total costs of development (TCD) including for example
   licenses, tools, labor, and support - must be considered from initial
   design, to maintenance, all through the end of life of the product.
   This paper reviews critical aspects for going open source, including
   software and hardware, use of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)
   alternatives, system design going from a monolithic, single-binary,
   firmware to a layered design with operating system, middleware, and user
   applications.},

Title = {Willingness of WHO staff to work in health emergencies in the African
   Region: opportunity for phased deployment of staff and ensure continuity

Abstract = {A human resource base that ensures appropriate deployment of staff to
   emergencies, addressing different shock events in emergencies, without
   disrupting continuity of service is germane to a successful response.
   Consequently, the WHO Health Emergencies programme in the African
   Region, in collaboration with Africa Centre for Disease Control (ACDC)
   launched the African Volunteer Health Corps (AVoHC) and Strengthening
   and Utilization of Response Group for Emergencies (SURGE), an initiative
   aimed at ensuring a pool of timely responders. We explored the
   willingness of WHO staff to work in emergencies. A call for expression
   of interest to be part of the Elite Emergency Experts (Triple E) was
   published on 5 th July 2022 via email and was open for 5 weeks. The
   responses were analyzed using simple descriptive statistics and
   presented with graphic illustrations. A total of 1253 WHO staff, from
   all the six WHO regions, cutting across all cadre, applied to the call.
   The applicants had various trainings and experiences in emergency and
   have responded to mostly disease outbreaks. Two -third of the applicants
   were males. This paper did not explore reasons for the willingness to
   work in emergencies. However, contrary to fears expressed in literature
   that health workers would not want to work in emergencies with potential
   for infections, the applicants have worked mostly in infectious
   emergencies. Literature identified some themes on factors that could
   impact on willingness of health workers to work in emergencies. These
   include concerns for the safety of the responders and impact of
   partners, child and elderly care, as well as other family obligations,
   which emergency planners must consider in planning emergency response.},

Title = {Assessing nutrition literacy and nutrition counseling proficiency
   following an interdisciplinary culinary medicine elective},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {124},
Number = {10},
Pages = {421-428},
Month = {SEP 23},
Abstract = {Context: Culinary medicine (CM) is a growing field of education that
   aims to bridge the gap between the clinical need for nutritional
   counseling and the lack of education on the topic. Healthcare
   professionals can aid in nutrition-related noncommunicable disease (NCD)
   prevention by improving a patient's dietary behavior. However, the
   presence of nutrition education in healthcare curricula is lacking.
   Early evidence indicates that CM could address this gap. Objectives: The
   objectives of this study are to determine if the provision of an
   interdisciplinary CM elective will improve student knowledge and
   confidence with counseling on nutrition and culinary principles, and to
   improve personal dietary habits of students. Methods This was a
   one-group pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design. First- and
   second-year osteopathic medical students (OMS) and nurse practitioner
   students were recruited to participate in a CM elective via email.
   Participants were excluded if they were not in good academic standing at
   their respective institutions. Twelve individuals (n=8 medical; n=4
   nursing) were enrolled in the course. Participants completed pre- and
   postcourse surveys to determine changes in nutrition literacy (Nutrition
   Literacy Assessment Instrument {[}NLit42]), nutrition counseling
   proficiency (Nutrition Survey for Family Practitioners), and dietary
   quality (Automated Self-Administered 24-h dietary assessment tool; ASA24
   (R)). A two-sided, paired t test was conducted to determine changes in
   outcome variables. Results: All 12 participants completed the precourse
   assessments, and 8 participants completed the postcourse assessments.
   Culinary activity attendance was 94.5 \%. Participants exhibited a
   statistically significant increase in their overall nutrition literacy
   scores after completing the CM elective (p=0.006). Literacy
   subcategories indicated that the improvement came from the participant's
   ability to understand household measurements (p=0.005) better. Increases
   in self-reported proficiency were observed for participants' confidence
   to counsel on nutrition and prevention/wellness (p=0.02) and
   macronutrients in health and food safety (p=0.01). No statistically
   significant changes in the personal dietary pattern or quality were
   observed. Conclusions: The interdisciplinary CM elective improved
   nutrition literacy and some aspects of counseling proficiency. Although
   small shifts in dietary variables were observed, the elective did not
   statistically improve participants' dietary pattern. However, some
   changes that were observed may lead to clinically relevant outcomes if
   maintained long-term. These findings are encouraging. Implementing CM as
   an educational tool could improve healthcare practitioners' ability to
   understand and counsel patients on nutrition to prevent the
   nutrition-related NCDs.},

Abstract = {An acute gastroenteritis (AG) outbreak occurred among participants in an
   obstacle race in France in the summer of 2015. An investigation in two
   phases was conducted to identify the source of infection and document
   the extent of the outbreak. First, a message on a social media website
   asked racers to report any symptoms by email to the Regional Health
   Agency of Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur. Second, a retrospective
   cross-sectional study was conducted through an interactive questionnaire
   for all participants, followed by an analytical study of potential risks
   factors. Of 8,229 persons registered, 1,264 adults reported AG resolved
   within 48 hours. Of adults who reported AG, 866 met the case definition.
   Age group, departure time and ingestion of mud were associated with AG.
   Twenty stool specimens tested negative for bacteria. All four stool
   samples tested for viruses were positive for norovirus genogroup I and
   genotype 2. No indicator bacteria for faecal contamination were found in
   drinking water but muddy water of ponds tested positive. The outbreak
   was possibly caused by human-to-human transmission of a norovirus
   introduced by one or more persons and transmitted through contaminated
   mud. Risks related to similar races should be assessed and
   recommendations be proposed to raise awareness among health authorities
   and organisers.},

Month = {APR 9},
Abstract = {PurposeCause-related B2B marketing programs involve sponsoring
   organisations working with B2B suppliers with the help of non-profit
   organisations (NPOs) on practises relating to environmental
   friendliness, workforce diversity, human rights, safety, philanthropy
   and business ethics. The study aims to identify the combinatory factors
   driving the adoption of Digital B2B platforms for managing cause-related
   B2B marketing programs.Design/methodology/approachThe study adopts an
   innovative approach of fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis
   (fsQCA) on data collated from top corporations in India supporting
   cause-related B2B marketing programs. Sponsoring organisations and NPO
   dyads (i.e. survey both) filled out an email survey on 264 cause-related
   B2B marketing programs.FindingsThe study establishes that the
   combination of technological, organisational and environmental factors
   would lead to the adoption of Digital B2B platforms in managing
   cause-related B2B marketing programs. The study identifies six
   combinations of these factors for adopting Digital B2B platforms within
   and across sponsoring organisations and NPOs.Practical implicationsThe
   study findings would aid cause-related B2B marketers in developing
   Digital B2B platforms' capabilities by understanding the different
   combinations of factors driving adoption. Digital B2B platforms'
   capabilities can improve market performance if developed as core
   competencies.Social implicationsThe study findings would enable
   improvements in the implementation and performance of cause-related B2B
   marketing programs. Better management of cause-related B2B marketing
   programs would help increase beneficiary coverage and the realisation of
   societal goals.Originality/valueTo the author's knowledge, this is the
   first study to apply the TOE framework in conjunction with complexity
   theory to explain the diffusion of adoption of Digital B2B platforms for
   managing cause-related B2B marketing programs.},

Abstract = {A survey of the users of an online computer-mediated matchmaking service
   showed that their communication patterns and objectives varied by their
   sex, shyness level, and appearance. Men generally contacted women more
   than vice versa, but a substantial minority of the women contacted a
   great number of men, suggesting that the safety and anonymity the system
   offered helped them break free from traditional sex role norms. More
   than half of the women reported starting a romantic or sexual
   relationship through the system, as compared to less than a third of the
   men, reflecting, in part, that men outnumber women on the system nearly
   three to one. Users who scored higher on a shyness scale were much more
   likely than less shy users to say they were using the system to find
   romance or sex, suggesting shier users employ the system as a way to
   overcome their inhibitions. Women who rated their own appearance as
   average were less likely to be contacted by men than those who rated
   their appearance as above average, but there was no significant
   difference between appearance groups concerning the likelihood of
   starting a romantic or sexual relationship. Intrinsic aspects of this
   computer-mediated matchmaking system helped some users overcome
   relationship-initiation barriers rooted in sex role, shyness, and

Abstract = {Decision 1082/2013 on Serious Cross-border Health Threats (Health
   Threats Decision) was adopted in 2013 with the aim of preparing for and
   responding to serious health threats. In this legislation, the European
   Union adopts an ``all-hazards{''} approach which strongly relies on the
   exchange of information as a driver of regulatory activities. This
   article first demonstrates that the electronic systems of information
   exchange constitute a key tool in EU Health Crisis and Disaster
   Management ({''}EHCDM{''}). Second, it identifies the distinctive
   features of these mechanisms in the EU context: the reinforcement of a
   statutory policy shift towards securitisation of public health, the
   peculiarity of the EU composite administrative procedures as well as the
   facilitation of the quality of the sense-making activities. Finally, the
   article uncovers the possible problems which may affect the adequate
   functioning of EHCDM and argues the routes for further research. The
   piece links legal analysis with the interdisciplinary conceptual lens to
   offer an important contribution to closer characterisation of the EHCDM
   as a field in its own right together with a better understanding of the
   EU public health law and administration in the context of transboundary
   crisis management and health security governance.},

Title = {Exact and Heuristic Algorithms for Some Spatial-aware Interest Group
   Query Problems},

Abstract = {Location-based social networks are important issues in the recent
   decade. In modern social networks, such as Twitter, Facebook, and Plurk,
   attempt to get the accurate address positions from their users, and try
   to reduce the gap between virtuality and reality. This paper mainly aims
   at both the interests of Internet users and their real positions. This
   issue is called the spatial-aware interest group query problem (SIGQP).
   Given a user set U with n users, a keyword set W with m words, and a
   spatial object set S with s items, each of which contains one or
   multiple keywords. If a user checks in a certain spatial object, it
   means the user could be interested in that part of keywords, which is
   countable to clarify the interests of the user. The SIGQP then tries to
   find a k-user set U-k, k <= n, such that the union of keywords of these
   k users will equal to W, and additionally, the diameter (longest
   Euclidean distance of two arbitrary users in U-k) should be as small as
   possible. The SIGQP has been proved as NP-Complete, and two heuristic
   algorithms have been proposed. Extended from SIGQP, another problem is
   in finding the smallest k for U(k )to cover all the keywords, with the
   users' distance as the secondary criterion, called as ``minimum user
   spatial-aware interest group query problem{''} (MUSIGQP). This paper
   designs a branch \& bound method and a measure \& conquer method to
   solve SIGQP and MUSIGQP respectively, and a performance analysis is
   given.},

   teleworkers (TELEWORK study): protocol for a cluster randomized
   controlled trial},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {67},

Month = {JAN-DEC},
Abstract = {Objectives Teleworking from home was widespread during the 2019
   coronavirus disease pandemic. This working practice is expected to
   maintain popularity among employers and employees. Compared with
   in-person workers, teleworkers tend to be less physically active and
   have more musculoskeletal pain. Interventions specific to reducing
   health risks among teleworkers have not been identified. This study will
   examine the effects of an occupational lifestyle intervention
   encompassing 3 components: physical activity promotion, musculoskeletal
   health, and work environment improvement.Methods This cluster randomized
   trial will have a target sample size of 500 participants. The target
   population is healthy adults aged 18-64 years who telework at least once
   per week. Randomization will be conducted on a stratified block basis
   for clusters of 20 to 100 individuals within the recruited companies.
   The intervention period will be 12 weeks and comprise individual (online
   lectures, feedback, and periodic email messages), sociocultural (team
   building through step competition), physical (poster and tabletop
   pop-up), and organizational (encouraging message from an executive)
   strategies. The intervention group will be compared with a wait-list
   control group. The primary outcome will be the number of steps taken, as
   assessed by an accelerometer, and the secondary outcomes will be
   musculoskeletal pain and a telecommuting environment. The study protocol
   was registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network
   Clinical Trials Registry (ID: UMIN000053861)
   (https://center6.umin.ac.jp/cgi-open-bin/ctr/ctr.cgi?function=brows\&act
   ion=brows\&recptno=R000061478\&type=summary\&language=J).Results Study
   enrollment began in March 2024, and the intervention will be completed
   by March 2025.Conclusions The results of this study are expected to
   provide helpful data for promoting healthy teleworking practices.},

Abstract = {Employment is a critical feature of modern society. The nature of
   employment not only determines the operation of the economy and economic
   and business prosperity but also determines the quality of individuals'
   lives. In that respect, work is both an economic transaction and central
   to human life and dignity. There has been a seismic shift in how
   employment manifests in twenty-first-century Western economies. Rapid
   growth in non-standard forms of employment, and the corresponding
   decline of the standard employment contract, has resulted in a less
   stable and more fragmented labour market. Flexibility may benefit a
   worker who can operate successfully as a `free agent in a boundary-less
   workplace'. However, others may become stuck in enclaves, unable to
   access permanent work and having little bargaining power. This raises
   the prospect of the existence of a `dual labour market', where workers
   are separated into primary and secondary markets. Those engaged in the
   primary market will have job security and opportunities for advancement,
   while those in secondary markets will become increasingly vulnerable.
   Regulatory systems based upon traditional models of employment are
   ill-equipped to deal with the challenges these developments pose for
   modern economies.},

Abstract = {Background The number of accidents due to distracted pedestrian is on
   the rise and many governments and institutions are enacting public
   policies which restrict texting while walking. However, pedestrians do
   more than just texting when they use their mobile devices on the go.
   Objective Exploring pedestrian multitasking, this paper aims to examine
   the effects of mobile device task type on pedestrian performance
   outcomes. Method We performed two studies in lab simulations where 78
   participants were asked to perform different tasks on a mobile device
   (playing a game, reading, writing an email, texting one person, group
   texting) while performing a pedestrian visual discrimination task while
   either standing or walking on a treadmill. Behavioral performance as
   well as neurophysiological data are collected. Results Results show that
   compared to a no-phone control, multitasking with any of the tasks on a
   mobile device leads to poor performance on a pedestrian visual
   discrimination task. Playing a game is the most cognitively demanding
   task and leads to the greatest performance degradation. Conclusion Our
   studies show that multitasking with a mobile device has the potential to
   negatively impact pedestrian safety, regardless of task type. However,
   the impacts of different mobile device tasks are not all equivalent.
   More research is needed to tease out the different effects of these
   various tasks and to design mobile applications which effectively and
   safely capture pedestrians' attention. Application Public policy,
   infrastructure, and smart technologies can be used to mitigate the
   negative effects of mobile multitasking. A more thorough understanding
   of mobile device task-specific factors at play can help tailor these
   counter-measures to better aid distracted pedestrians.},

Title = {Protecting providers and patients: results of an Internet survey of
   health care workers' risk perceptions and ethical concerns during the
   COVID-19 pandemic},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 24},
Abstract = {Background The COVID-19 pandemic has generated worldwide scarcity of
   critical resources to protect against and treat disease. Shortages of
   face masks and other protective equipment place health workers, already
   on the frontline of the disease, at higher risk. Moral distress from
   making difficult decisions about allocating scarce resources and care to
   patients ill with COVID-19 can further add to burdens health workers
   face. This study investigates clinical health workers' risk perceptions
   and concerns about the ethics of their clinical decision-making, the
   actions of their institutions to address resource scarcity concerns
   during the COVID-19 pandemic, and their ability to voice safety
   concerns, as well as their own views on how scarce resources should be
   allocated. Methods An online survey was open to health care workers who
   provide clinical care to patients, with no specialty training or
   geographic location requirements, from May 19 to June 30, 2020.
   Participants were recruited through purposive sampling using medical
   association and institutional email lists, and by snowball sampling.
   Results Of 839 participants, a majority were physicians (540, 69.4\%)
   working in academic medical centers (270, 35.2\%) or private health
   systems in the community (234, 30.5\%) in the USA (760, 90.7\%). Most
   reported being concerned about their own health (494, 73.6\%) and about
   the possibility of spreading COVID-19 to family and friends (534,
   85.9\%) during the pandemic. All respondents reported shortages or
   rationing of at least one type of medical resource (e.g., sanitizing
   supplies and personal protective equipment). More than half of
   respondents (351, 53.9\%) did not feel they received sufficient training
   in how to allocate scarce resources in the pandemic. Many felt moral
   distress related to conflicts between institutional constraints and what
   they believed was right (459, 66.5\%). Though a majority (459, 67.7\%)
   reported feeling ``comfortable{''} internally communicating with their
   administration about safety issues, far fewer reported feeling
   ``confident{''} speaking publicly about safety issues without
   retaliation from their institution (255, 37.3\%). Conclusions In the
   face of limited resources, surveyed health care workers reported concern
   about their own and their families' health from exposure. Securing
   adequate protective equipment must be a high priority for pandemic
   management. In addition, more governmental and facility-level ethical
   guidance is required for allocation of resources given ongoing scarcity,
   and facilities must create conditions so health care workers can speak
   openly about safety issues without fear of retaliation.},

Title = {Risk Based Monitoring (RBM): A global study focusing on perception and
   merits among clinical investigational sites},
Journal = {CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS COMMUNICATIONS},

Abstract = {Background: Several approaches to clinical trial monitoring, including
   the Risk Based Monitoring (RBM) are aimed at the protection of the human
   subjects (safety), improved data quality, and ultimately, reducing the
   cost of drug development and operations. There exists minimal evidence
   globally about the perceptions and the level of confidence among the
   clinical staff on the merits of RBM. The present study assessed the
   perception among clinical research staff globally (developed and
   emerging countries) on the applicability and adaptability of RBM.
   Methods: An electronic questionnaire survey consisting of twelve items
   was developed, validated, and then circulated globally via email to
   three thousand clinical research staff members at various
   investigational sites. This survey collected information on the use of
   RBM and factors that relate to clinical trial cost, data quality,
   subject safety, and the readiness to adopt RBM practices. The survey
   responses were summarized and analyzed by using the information e.g.
   responder's age, sex, clinical research role, global location, and
   experience in clinical research trials.
   Results: Responses were received from ten countries, six emerging and
   four developed. Of the 3000 surveys sent to emerging (1,000) and
   developed (2,000) countries, a total response of 595 (261 vs 334)
   participants was received, respectively. The emerging versus developed
   group had 100 vs 137 participants with complete responses (CR); 34 vs 35
   participants with partial responses (PR); and 127 vs 162 participants
   were disqualified with no exposure (NE) responses. About 67\% of the
   overall responders were investigators, followed by 23\%, 10\%
   coordinator and other staff respectively. There was not significant
   difference in feedback between the researchers in developing versus
   emerging countries (p = 0.20) with regards to their perception of RBM
   reducing the overall cost of conducting a clinical research. Responders
   from emerging countries had a more favorable response than in the
   developed countries. Similarly, when asked if RBM will be more effective
   in addressing data quality (p = 0.006), patient safety (p = 0.05) and
   findings fraud/fabrication (p = 0.01), researchers from emerging
   countries indicated more confidence than researchers from developed
   countries. There was also a significant difference in the readiness to
   adopt RBM between responders of emerging versus developed markets (p <
   0.0001).
   Conclusion: This unique study performed across ten emerging and
   developed countries strongly supported the need for systematic global
   training, education, and implementation of RBM regulatory guidance, with
   an aim for better safety of subjects and improved quality of clinical
   trial data. Furthermore, studies with larger sample sizes are
   recommended to provide an evidence-based approach. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Title = {Connecting the disconnected: Leveraging an in-home team member for video

Abstract = {Background: Older adults are interested and able to complete video
   visits, but often require coaching and practice to succeed. Data show a
   widening digital divide between older and younger adults using video
   visits. We conducted a qualitative feasibility study to investigate
   these gaps via ethnographic methods, including a team member in older
   participants' homes.Methods: This ethnographic feasibility study
   included a virtual medication reconciliation visit with a clinical
   pharmacist for Veterans aged 65 and older taking 5 or more medications.
   An in-home study team member joined the participant and recorded
   observations in structured fieldnotes derived from the Updated
   Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and Age-Friendly
   Health Systems. Fieldnotes included behind-the-scenes facilitators,
   barriers, and solutions to challenges before and during the visits. We
   conducted a thematic analysis of these observations and matched themes
   to implementation solutions from the Expert Recommendations for
   Implementing Change.Results: Twenty participants completed a video
   visit. Participants were 74 years old (range 68-80) taking 12 daily
   medications (range 7-24). Challenges occurred in half of the visits and
   took the in-home team member and/or pharmacist an average of 10 minutes
   to troubleshoot. Challenges included notable new findings, such as that
   half of the participants required technology assistance for challenges
   that would not have been able to be solved by the pharmacist virtually.
   Furthermore, although many participants had a device or had used video
   visits before, some did not have a single device with video, audio,
   Internet, and access to their email username and password.Conclusions:
   Clinicians may apply these evidence-based implementation solutions to
   their approach to video visits with older adults, including having a
   team member join the visit before the clinician, involving tech-savvy
   family members, ensuring the device works with the visit platform ahead
   of time, and creating a troubleshooting guide from our common
   challenges.},

Abstract = {We analyzed data on non-fatal occupational injuries reported to
   Malaysia's social security organization from 2002 to 2006. There was a
   decrease in both the absolute number and the incidence rates of these
   injuries over time. About 40\% of cases occurred in the manufacturing
   sector followed by the service (17\%) and trading (17\%) sectors. The
   agriculture sector reported the highest incidence rate (24.1/1,000),
   followed by the manufacturing sector subcategories of wood-product
   manufacturing (22.1/1,000) and non-metallic industries (20.8/1,000). Men
   age 40 to 59 and persons of Indian ethnicity had a greater tendency to
   sustain injuries. Government and non-governmental organizations should
   strive to develop strategies to reduce the occupational injuries
   targeting vulnerable groups. Enforcement of safety measures will further
   play an important role to ensure that both employees and employers take
   special precautions to address workplace hazards.},

   System},

Abstract = {The objective of this research was to assess the feasibility of a
   rollover detection and emergency notification system for farm tractors
   using field tests. The emergency notification system was developed based
   on a tractor stability model and implemented on a mobile electronic
   device with the iOS operating system. A complementary filter was
   implemented to combine the data from the accelerometer and gyroscope
   sensors to improve their accuracies in calculating the roll and pitch
   angles and the roll and pitch rates. The system estimates a stability
   index value during tractor operation, displays feedback messages when
   the stability index is lower than a preset threshold value, and
   transmits emergency notification messages when an overturn happens. Ten
   tractor rollover tests were conducted on a field track. The developed
   system successfully monitored the stability of the tractor during all of
   the tests. The iOS application was able to detect rollover accidents and
   transmit emergency notifications in the form of a phone call and email
   when an accident was detected. The system can be a useful tool for
   training and education in safe tractor operation. The system also has
   potential for stability monitoring and emergency notification of other
   on- road and off-road motorized vehicles.},

Abstract = {Managing interactions between human activities and marine mammals often
   relies on an understanding of the real-time distribution or occurrence
   of animals. Visual surveys typically cannot provide persistent
   monitoring because of expense and weather limitations, and while passive
   acoustic recorders can monitor continuously, the data they collect are
   often not accessible until the recorder is recovered. We have developed
   a moored passive acoustic monitoring system that provides near real-time
   occurrence estimates for humpback, sei, fin and North Atlantic right
   whales from a single site for a year, and makes those occurrence
   estimates available via a publicly accessible website, email and text
   messages, a smartphone/tablet app and the U.S. Coast Guard's maritime
   domain awareness software. We evaluated this system using a buoy
   deployed off the coast of Massachusetts during 2015-2016 and redeployed
   again during 2016-2017. Near real-time estimates of whale occurrence
   were compared to simultaneously collected archived audio as well as
   whale sightings collected near the buoy by aerial surveys. False
   detection rates for right, humpback and sei whales were 0\% and nearly
   0\% for fin whales, whereas missed detection rates at daily time scales
   were modest (12\%-42\%). Missed detections were significantly associated
   with low calling rates for all species. We observed strong associations
   between right whale visual sightings and near real-time acoustic
   detections over a monitoring range 30-40 km and temporal scales of 24-48
   hr, suggesting that silent animals were not especially problematic for
   estimating occurrence of right whales in the study area. There was no
   association between acoustic detections and visual sightings of humpback
   whales. The moored buoy has been used to reduce the risk of ship strikes
   for right whales in a U.S. Coast Guard gunnery range, and can be applied
   to other mitigation applications.},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe analysis of gene expression levels is used in many
   clinical studies to know how patients evolve or to find new genetic
   biomarkers that could help in clinical decision making. However, the
   techniques and software available for these analyses are not intended
   for physicians, but for geneticists. However, enabling physicians to
   make initial discoveries on these data would benefit in the clinical
   assay development.ResultsMelanoma is a highly immunogenic tumor.
   Therefore, in recent years physicians have incorporated immune system
   altering drugs into their therapeutic arsenal against this disease,
   revolutionizing the treatment of patients with an advanced stage of the
   cancer. This has led us to explore and deepen our knowledge of the
   immunology surrounding melanoma, in order to optimize the approach.
   Within this project we have developed a database for collecting relevant
   clinical information for melanoma patients, including the storage of
   patient gene expression levels obtained from the NanoString platform
   (several samples are taken from each patient). The Immune Profiling
   Panel is used in this case. This database is being exploited through the
   analysis of the different expression profiles of the patients. This
   analysis is being done with Python, and a parallel version of the
   algorithms is available with Apache Spark to provide scalability as
   needed.ConclusionsVIGLA-M, the visual analysis tool for gene expression
   levels in melanoma patients is available at
   http://khaos.uma.es/melanoma/. The platform with real clinical data can
   be accessed with a demo user account, physician, using password
   physician\_test\_7634 (if you encounter any problems, contact us at this
   email address: mailto: khaos@lcc.uma.es). The initial results of the
   analysis of gene expression levels using these tools are providing first
   insights into the patients' evolution. These results are promising, but
   larger scale tests must be developed once new patients have been
   sequenced, to discover new genetic biomarkers.},

Title = {Implementation of EMS Clinician Feedback Tool Encourages Patient
   Feedback Requests and Professional Development: A Mixed-Methods Study},
Journal = {PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JAN 13},
Abstract = {Objectives: Emergency medical services (EMS) clinicians express
   dissatisfaction with the quality and quantity of clinical feedback
   received from hospitals, which is exacerbated by the absence of
   standardized feedback processes. A reported lack of regular feedback
   impedes their ability to learn and improve care. We evaluated a newly
   implemented feedback tool's utilization and perceived impact on EMS
   clinicians and our health system. Methods: We employed a mixed-methods
   study design in a single academic medical center emergency department.
   Quantitative data collected focused on patients' clinical
   characteristics and characteristics of utilizers of the feedback tool
   during implementation (September 2023-July 2024). Qualitative data
   involved semi-structured interviews with EMS clinicians who had diverse
   experiences with the feedback tool and years of EMS service
   Semi-structured interviews applied a phenomenological framework, and
   were videorecorded, transcribed, and independently coded to identify key
   themes surrounding the utilization and impact of the implemented tool.
   Results: Among the 381 feedback requests, 139 (36.5\%) pertained to
   patients aged >= 65 years, while 44 (11.5 \%) included patients <18
   years; 343 (90\%) had an Emergency Severity Index score of >= 2. Major
   complaints included traumatic (n = 165; 43.3\%), neurologic (n = 90;
   23.6\%), and cardiac (n = 82; 21.5\%). Emergency responder agencies
   included ground ambulance 227 (59.6\%), air medical 90 (23.6\%), public
   safety answering points 37 (9.7\%), and fire service 27 (7.1\%). The
   primary response method was e-mail 353 (93.7\%). There was an average of
   35 feedback requests per month (interquartile range: 27-59). EMS
   clinicians from multiple agencies with varying levels of knowledge of
   the feedback mechanism provided qualitative insights regarding the
   feedback tool, which covered several key areas: application and
   technological design, utilization, utility of feedback provided,
   barriers, comparisons to other systems, and areas for improvement.
   Conclusions: The standardized feedback mechanism implemented for EMS
   clinicians showed engagement, especially among ground responders caring
   for high-acuity patients, highlighting its importance in patient care.
   The preference for email emphasizes the need for efficient communication
   channels. Clinicians found the system accessible and user-friendly. The
   feedback tool was perceived as crucial for professional development and
   personal growth, allowing clinicians to gain closure on patient cases
   and potentially improve future patient care practices.},

Title = {Impact of conflict on medical education: a cross-sectional survey of
   students and institutions in Iraq},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Objective: This study surveyed all Iraqi medical schools and a
   cross-section of Iraqi medical students regarding their institutional
   and student experiences of medical education amidst ongoing conflict.
   The objective was to better understand the current resources and
   challenges facing medical schools, and the impacts of conflict on the
   training landscape and student experience, to provide evidence for
   further research and policy development.
   Setting: Deans of all Iraqi medical schools registered in the World
   Directory of Medical Schools were invited to participate in a survey
   electronically. Medical students from three Iraqi medical schools were
   invited to participate in a survey electronically.
   Outcomes: Primary: Student enrolment and graduation statistics; human
   resources of medical schools; dean perspectives on impact of conflict.
   Secondary: Medical student perspectives on quality of teaching, welfare
   and future career intentions.
   Findings: Of 24 medical schools listed in the World Directory of Medical
   Schools, 15 replied to an initial email sent to confirm their contact
   details, and 8 medical schools responded to our survey, giving a
   response rate from contactable medical schools of 53\% and overall of
   33\%. Five (63\%) medical schools reported medical student educational
   attainment being impaired or significantly impaired; 4 (50\%) felt the
   quality of training medical schools could offer had been impaired or
   significantly impaired due to conflict. A total of 197 medical students
   responded, 62\% of whom felt their safety had been threatened due to
   violent insecurity. The majority (56\%) of medical students intended to
   leave Iraq after graduating.
   Conclusions: Medical schools are facing challenges in staff recruitment
   and adequate resource provision; the majority believe quality of
   training has suffered as a result. Medical students are experiencing
   added psychological stress and lower quality of teaching; the majority
   intend to leave Iraq after graduation.},

Abstract = {Health professionals trained in occupational health are essential to
   reduce the burden of occupational accidents and diseases. However,
   training resources are limited globally. We aimed to promote
   occupational health and safety (OHS) using virtual patients (VPs) in
   Brazil, Chile, and Germany. Virtual patients were created in three
   Latin-American health centers. So-called ``partner VPs{''} comparing the
   distinct health care systems were designed. Translation, adaptation to
   different medical and legal systems, expert review, implementation into
   under- and postgraduate teaching, and user evaluation were performed.
   Twelve VPs covering traditional and contemporary OHS issues are
   available in Spanish, Portuguese, and English. Overall, 2371 students
   used the VPs. The number of Latin American users who evaluated VP
   content and relevance for their professional career was statistically
   significantly higher than the number of German students. VPs are a
   feasible learning method for OHS in middle-income countries. Partner VPs
   seem to be useful for teaching global aspects.},

Title = {Implementation strategies in the context of medication reconciliation: a
   qualitative study},
Journal = {IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 3},
Abstract = {Background Medication reconciliation (MedRec) is an important patient
   safety initiative that aims to prevent patient harm from medication
   errors. Yet, the implementation and sustainability of MedRec
   interventions have been challenging due to contextual barriers like the
   lack of interprofessional communication (among pharmacists, nurses, and
   providers) and limited organizational capacity. How to best implement
   MedRec interventions remains unclear. Guided by the Expert
   Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) taxonomy, we report the
   differing strategies hospital implementation teams used to implement an
   evidence-based MedRec Toolkit (the MARQUIS Toolkit).Methods A
   qualitative study was conducted with implementation teams and executive
   leaders of hospitals participating in the federally funded
   ``Implementation of a Medication Reconciliation Toolkit to Improve
   Patient Safety{''} (known as MARQUIS2) research study. Data consisted of
   transcripts from web-based focus groups and individual interviews, as
   well as meeting minutes. Interview data were transcribed and analyzed
   using content analysis and the constant comparison technique.Results
   Data were collected from 16 hospitals using 2 focus groups, 3 group
   interviews, and 11 individual interviews, 10 sites' meeting minutes, and
   an email interview of an executive. Major categories of implementation
   strategies predominantly mirrored the ERIC strategies of ``Plan,{''}
   ``Educate,{''} ``Restructure,{''} and ``Quality Management.{''}
   Participants rarely used the ERIC strategies of finance and attending to
   policy context. Two new non-ERIC categories of strategies
   emerged-{''}Integration{''} and ``Professional roles and
   responsibilities.{''} Of the 73 specific strategies in the ERIC
   taxonomy, 32 were used to implement the MARQUIS Toolkit and 11 new, and
   non-ERIC strategies were identified (e.g., aligning with existing
   initiatives and professional roles and responsibilities).Conclusions
   Complex interventions like the MARQUIS MedRec Toolkit can benefit from
   the ERIC taxonomy, but adaptations and new strategies (and even
   categories) are necessary to fully capture the range of approaches to
   implementation.},

Title = {An inquiry into the legal status of the ECOWAS cybercrime directive and
   the implications of its obligations for member states},
Journal = {COMPUTER LAW \& SECURITY REVIEW},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {35},
Number = {6},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {On 19 August 2011, the ECOWAS Council of Ministers adopted Directive
   C/DIR.1/08/11 on Fighting Cybercrime at its Sixty Sixth Ordinary Session
   in Abuja, Nigeria. The adoption of the Directive at that time arose from
   the need to tackle the growing trend in cybercrime within the ECOWAS
   region, as some Member States were already gaining global notoriety as
   major sources of email scams and Internet fraud. Accordingly, the
   Directive established a legal framework for the control of cybercrime
   within the ECOWAS region, and also imposed obligations on Member States
   to establish the necessary legislative, regulatory and administrative
   measures to tackle cybercrime. In particular, the Directive required
   Member States to implement those obligations ``not later than 1st
   January, 2014{''}. This article undertakes an inquiry into the legal
   status of the Directive as an ECOWAS regional instrument in the domestic
   legal systems of Member States.
   In this regard, the article examines whether the requirement regarding
   the superiority or direct applicability of ECOWAS Community laws such as
   ECOWAS Acts and Regulations in the domestic legal systems of Member
   States also apply to ECOWAS Directives such as the Cybercrime Directive.
   The article also examines the legal implications of the Directive's
   obligations for Member States. The article argues that while some Member
   States have not implemented the obligations under the Directive, that
   those obligations however provide a legal basis for holding Member
   States accountable, where the failure to implement has encouraged the
   perpetration of cybercrime that infringed fundamental rights guaranteed
   under human right instruments such as the African Charter on Human and
   Peoples' Rights or under their national laws. (C) 2019 Uchenna Jerome

Abstract = {ENSCO, Inc. has developed the next generation of real time Vehicle Track
   Interaction (V/TI) Monitoring system. The system provides continuous
   measurement of car body, truck motions and axle impacts. Software
   detects various acceleration events, tag them with GPS time and location
   information, and deliver the data to a central processing system through
   the latest Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) wireless communication
   network. Upon delivery, the information is automatically tagged with
   milepost and subdivision or other geographic reference and loaded into
   an enterprise database management system. The data is available in near
   real time via the web on maps of the track and track infrastructure
   where users have the option of generating tabular reports or viewing the
   actual waveform of the acceleration event. In addition, the system
   offers real time pager and email notifications of predefined user
   events.
   This system automatically provides real time monitoring and detection of
   track profile and alignment problems, battered joints, rail-end
   mismatch, misaligned switches and damaged frogs. The information
   generated by this system helps railroads prioritize maintenance for
   these track anomalies that can cause equipment or lading damage. The
   location information picked up by the system allows railroads to
   navigate back to the track areas for follow up remedial actions or
   enhance track maintenance planning decisions. There are over 60 systems
   in operation on passenger and freight railroads. This paper will address
   the technology behind the monitoring, the events detected in the field,
   and how the system can be used to supplement traditional track
   inspection technologies.},

Title = {Information Communication Technology (ICT) use among PLHIV in China: A
   promising but underutilized venue for HIV prevention and care},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},

Abstract = {In this paper, we report the use of information and communication
   technology (ICT) among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Guangxi, China.
   A total 2987 participants were recruited from 12 sites with the highest
   number of cumulative HIV incidence, including 2 cities and 10 counties.
   A questionnaire survey was conducted to collect data on the
   participants' social demographic characteristics, clinical outcomes,
   infections and coinfections, pattern of ICT use, and use and intention
   of using ICT in HIV and AIDS management. The data was analyzed using
   SPSS, version 24. The results showed 78.7\% (n = 2347) never used a
   computer, 86.9\% (n = 2587) had a cellphone, 32.7\% (n = 207) owned an
   email account, and 85.4\% (n = 544) owned a social media account. Less
   than half of the participants reported ever using ICTs for HIV
   management. Only 26.2\% (n = 266) were willing to join a web-based HIV
   prevention program. Findings of this study suggest that there was an
   imbalance in the participants' ICT device ownership and choices of media
   platform. Social media appeared to be a potential platform for health
   intervention among this group. There was a low penetration of computer
   use among rural participants and a large disparity between the urban and
   rural participants, which indicated a need to expand the current
   infrastructure related to ICTs and increase people's health literacy.
   Future research also needs to pay attention to security and
   trustworthiness of the intervention program to better promote ICTs as an
   efficient and reliable platform for HIV prevention and care.},

Title = {A survey of personal protective equipment use among US otolaryngologists
   during the COVID-19 pandemic},
Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {41},
Number = {6},
Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Objective: Describe current practices and challenges in personal
   protective equipment (PPE) use among US otolaryngologists during the
   COVID-19 pandemic.
   Study design: Online survey.
   Setting: Academic and non-academic healthcare institutions.
   Subjects and methods: Subjects included US otolaryngology physicians.
   Emails were sent on April 17, 2020 to program coordinators at 121
   residency programs, who were requested to forward the email to program
   directors for distribution. Further recruitment occurred through
   snowball recruitment. The survey was closed on June 15, 2020.
   Results: Sixty-one participants completed the survey. 95.1\% reported
   routine access to full PPE (N95 +/- powered air purifying respirator
   {[}PAPR], gown, gloves, eye protection) for aerosol-generating
   procedures (AGPs) in COVID-19 patients, while 68.9\% had routine access
   to full PPE for AGPs in patients without confirmed COVID-19. 88.5\% had
   routine access to full PPE for potential aerosol-generating procedures
   (pAGPs) in COVID patients, while 80.3\% had routine access to full PPE
   for pAGPs in patients without confirmed COVID. All participants felt
   that they ``always{''} or ``usually{''} had necessary PPE to safely
   perform procedures and surgeries on COVID patients. 83.6\% received N95
   fitting in the past year, and 93.4\% reported adequate PPE training.
   Conclusion: The majority of participants reported routine access to full
   PPE for AGPs and pAGPs in all patients, regardless of COVID status.
   There was a high perception of security, as well as adequate N95 fitting
   and PPE training. Areas for improvement include: optimizing PPE
   availability for AGPs in patients without confirmed COVID and wider
   recognition of otolaryngologic procedures as high risk for
   aerosolization.},

Abstract = {BackgroundWhile the Safe Drinking Water Act allows states and localities
   to adopt stronger protections for drinking water, state and local
   requirements concerning private drinking water wells vary dramatically
   and often do not provide necessary protections for residents who rely on
   well water.ObjectiveThis paper inventories ten types of policies
   including laws, regulations, programs, and activities that states have
   adopted or partaken in to encourage safe drinking water for residential
   well owners.MethodsTo identify categories of private well protections,
   we conducted a preliminary internet search with key search terms to
   create an initial list of 10 categories of laws, regulations, programs,
   and activities (collectively referred to as ``policies{''}) that states
   have taken to protect residential well water quality. To have a private
   well safety category present, the law, regulation, program, or activity
   must fit within the scope of the ten classifications. To limit the
   breadth of our search, we excluded local and county protections, as well
   as activities by non-governmental organizations. We also excluded basic
   construction standards for new wells and licensing standards for well
   drillers, both of which are covered under a previous study. We conducted
   an additional internet search to complete a comprehensive review of each
   state and category and to validate our previous findings. In addition to
   this internet search, we completed phone and email outreach to the state
   agencies implementing the well safety categories identified in our
   internet search to confirm our results.ResultsThe results indicate a
   wide range of state-based well water protections. The number of
   residential well water protections present in each state ranged from 8
   policies in Iowa, Kentucky, and Maine to 1 policy in Oklahoma, with a
   median of 5 policies across the 50 states.ImpactThis paper examines
   protections that states have implemented to safeguard residential well
   water quality and to protect the health of people who rely on well
   water. This research reviews state-level regulations, laws, and
   programs, as opposed to local, municipal, county-level, or
   quasi-governmental protections for residential well owners. Residential
   well policies were examined across ten categories. Without any
   protections at the federal level, this research reveals gaps in state
   regulation and demonstrates the need for broader adoption of
   comprehensive state-level policies to better protect residential well
   owners from drinking water contaminants and their associated public
   health impacts.},

Title = {Nurses' Perceptions of Licensure Compact Legislation to Facilitate
   Interstate Practice: Results From the 2022 Michigan Nurses' Study},
Journal = {POLICY POLITICS \& NURSING PRACTICE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {25},
Number = {1},
Pages = {14-19},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {States are struggling to assure an adequate number of registered nurses
   are active in the clinical workforce to serve patients and communities.
   Nurse compact legislation-enacted in 39 states-facilitates interstate
   recognition of nurse licensure. We used a cross-sectional email survey
   of registered nurses in Michigan to measure their opinions on compact
   licensure legislation and examined differences in compact licensure
   opinions by nurses' personal characteristics. Primary analyses reported
   herein are from 7,098 Michigan nurses with complete data. Most
   respondents felt that the compact would make it easier to redeploy
   nurses in an emergency (76.6\%), improve access to nursing care
   (66.6\%), and boost their personal career options (55.1\%). Most nurses
   disagreed that compact legislation would weaken patient protections
   (60.7\%). The majority expressed neutral feelings on whether compact
   licensure would make disciplinary actions more difficult to enforce
   (50.9\%) and a plurality that current licensure policies were
   satisfactory (44.0\%). The majority were supportive of Michigan joining
   the compact (72.3\%). In multivariable analysis, stronger support for
   joining the compact was associated with advanced degrees, male sex, and
   younger age. Less support was associated with membership in a collective
   bargaining unit. Policymakers who wish to ease acute nurse vacancies
   should consider enacting nurse licensure compact legislation. Careful
   attention to patient protections and disciplinary review would address
   potential safety concerns.},

Title = {Protocol for single-arm clinical trial evaluating medical grade
   polycaprolactone breast scaffold implantation with autologous fat
   grafting for breast implant revision and congenital defect correction
   surgery},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {15},

Month = {APR 29},
Abstract = {Introduction Revision surgery following primary breast augmentation is
   common due to well-reported long-term limitations of permanent silicone
   implants. There are limited options for revision breast augmentation
   which avoids using silicone implants. Scaffold-guided breast tissue
   engineering (SGBTE) is a novel technique which uses breast scaffolds
   additively manufactured from medical grade polycaprolactone (mPCL),
   which is implanted and filled with autologous fat graft. This approach
   avoids limitations as observed with permanent silicone breast implants
   as the scaffold is porous and biodegradable. This clinical trial
   evaluates the safety and efficacy of SGBTE. Methods and analysis This
   study is an open, single-arm, monocentric, interventional, prospective
   clinical trial. The trial is being conducted at the Royal Brisbane and
   Women's Hospital (RBWH) in Herston (Queensland, Australia) of the Metro
   North Health Service. The trial investigates 15-20 women who require
   breast implant surgery and/or congenital breast defect correction
   surgery, where a mPCL breast scaffold is implanted and filled with
   autologous fat graft. The primary endpoint is postoperative device
   safety by assessing the rate of adverse device effect rate. Secondary
   endpoints include general adverse event frequency and severity, number
   of revision surgeries, general surgical outcomes and complications,
   patient-reported outcomes and volume replacement outcomes. Ethics and
   dissemination The RBWH Human Research Ethics Committee (EC00172) has
   approved this clinical trial (ethics approval: HREC/2021/QRBW/79906).
   Findings from this clinical trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy
   of implanting mPCL scaffolds filled with autologous fat graft. The
   results of this clinical trial will be published in a peer-reviewed
   journal and presented at scientific meetings. Trial registration number
   NCT05437757.},

Abstract = {Exposure techniques rely on the assumption that the extinction of the
   classically conditioned response (i.e., fear) will result in the
   disruption of limiting forms of avoidance behavior, both directly
   trained and derived/indirectly established. This report presents
   translational research that attempts to test this assumption in
   laboratory conditions in two experiments with human volunteers. The
   procedure in both experiments included six phases: (1) conditional
   discrimination training for the formation of two 6-member equivalence
   classes; (2) classical conditioning of elicited responses to Class 1
   (Al/B1) and Class 2 (A2/62) members in the white context, followed by
   conditioning of avoidance/approach responses to Class 1/Class 2 members,
   respectively, in the green context; (3) test for the transfer of
   avoidance/ approach functions and of eliciting respondent functions to
   DI /F1 and D2/F2 in the green context; (4) extinction of classically
   conditioned responses to Al /B1 in the white context; (5) test of the
   effects of respondent extinction on avoidance responding to the A, B, D,
   and F stimuli in the green context; and (6) test of derived symmetry and
   equivalence relations. Results show that after successful respondent
   extinction in the white context, only 33.3\% participants stopped
   showing avoidance behavior in the green context, and that respondent
   elicitation was reinstalled during the test (Phase 5). In Phase 4 of
   Experiment 2, in addition to undergoing respondent extinction,
   participants were instructed that the vvhite and green contexts were
   similar. Results show that after successful respondent extinction in the
   vvhite context during Phase 4, only 10\% participants stopped showing
   avoidance behavior in the green context, and that respondent elicitation
   was almost eliminated during the test (Phase 5). We discuss these
   findings and their applied implications. (C) 2013 Association for

Abstract = {We consider a security game in a setting consisting of two players (an
   attacker and a defender), each with a given budget to allocate towards
   attack and defense, respectively, of a set of nodes. Each node has a
   certain value to the attacker and the defender, along with a probability
   of being successfully compromised, which is a function of the
   investments in that node by both players. For such games, we
   characterize the optimal investment strategies by the players at the
   (unique) Nash Equilibrium. We then investigate the impacts of behavioral
   probability weighting on the investment strategies; such probability
   weighting, where humans overweight low probabilities and underweight
   high probabilities, has been identified by behavioral economists to be a
   common feature of human decision-making. We show via numerical
   experiments that behavioral decision-making by the defender causes the
   Nash Equilibrium investments in each node to change (where the defender
   overinvests in the high-value nodes and underinvests in the low-value
   nodes).},

Title = {Electronic patient self-assessment and management (SAM): a novel
   framework for cancer survivorship},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING},
Year = {2010},

Abstract = {Background: We propose a novel framework for management of cancer
   survivorship: electronic patient Self-Assessment and Management (SAM).
   SAM is a framework for transfer of information to and from patients in
   such a way as to increase both the patient's and the health care
   provider's understanding of the patient's progress, and to help ensure
   that patient care follows best practice.
   Methods: Patients who participate in the SAM system are contacted by
   email at regular intervals and asked to complete validated
   questionnaires online. Patient responses on these questionnaires are
   then analyzed in order to provide patients with real-time, online
   information about their progress and to provide them with tailored and
   standardized medical advice. Patient-level data from the questionnaires
   are ported in real time to the patient's health care provider to be
   uploaded to clinic notes. An initial version of SAM has been developed
   at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and the University of
   California, San Francisco (UCSF) for aiding the clinical management of
   patients after surgery for prostate cancer.
   Results: Pilot testing at MSKCC and UCSF suggests that implementation of
   SAM systems are feasible, with no major problems with compliance (> 70\%
   response rate) or security.
   Conclusion: SAM is a conceptually simple framework for passing
   information to and from patients in such a way as to increase both the
   patient's and the health care provider's understanding of the patient's
   progress, and to help ensure that patient care follows best practice.},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Objective - To assess late night library usage, including a demographic
   profile of students benefitting from late night hours, with an analysis
   of the services and resources they used, and whether the use of late
   hours is connected to student success.
   Design - A mixed-methods approach including quantitative demographic
   information alongside qualitative user feedback collected using a
   web-based survey.
   Setting - A large, public research university library in the United
   States of America using late night operating hours (11 P.M. to 7:30
   A.M.) to create 24-hour library availability 5 days per week.
   Subjects - Undergraduate and graduate students.
   Methods - Using the university's building monitoring database (BMD),
   researchers collected data on which students were using the library
   building when late night hours were in effect for fall and spring
   semesters. Along with the date and time of entry, the BMD collected the
   university ID number of the students and their email address. Using
   student ID numbers, information from the BMD was cross-referenced with
   anonymized demographic information from the university's institutional
   planning office, enabling comparisons across a range of other data,
   including students' discipline, GPA, and other information.
   Researchers emailed students the web-based survey, directly targeting
   users who had made use of the library's late night operating hours.
   Survey questions investigated when students used the library, explored
   student aims when in the library, and asked students to rank the tasks
   they were trying to accomplish while in the library. In addition,
   researchers sought student feedback on what services and resources they
   used during late hours, asking students to identify services and
   resources they would have liked to use but which were not offered during
   late night hours, and inquiring about students' sense of safety and
   security when using the library late at night.
   Main Results - In total, researchers report that 5,822 students,
   representing approximately 21\% of the campus population, visited the
   library during the late hours, for 22,383 visits. Researchers report
   that 57\% of late night users took advantage of the extended hours on
   more than one occasion, with 39\% returning three or more times. Sundays
   were the most popular day, while Thursdays were least popular.
   Researchers also tracked entry times, with the most popular entry times
   occurring between 11 P.M. to 2 A.M., accounting for 80\% of all late
   night visits. While survey respondents were drawn entirely from the late
   night users, 63\% preferred using the library late at night versus
   standard daytime operating hours.
   The overall survey response rate was less than 5\%. Survey respondents (
   n=243) reported participating in a variety of activities while visiting
   during late night library hours, with quiet study (87\%), working on
   projects or papers (72\%), and group study (42\%) as the most frequently
   reported activities. Respondents also ranked the top three activities
   they hoped to accomplish while in the library: quiet study (50\%) and
   work on projects and papers (34\%) remained top activities, though group
   study (20\%) fell to fourth place, slightly behind the third-ranked
   activity of printing or copying documents (22\%). Respondents reported
   their use of services during late night hours, indicating use of the
   university's wireless Internet access, library printers, computers, and
   online databases and electronic resources. The only staff service point
   available to students during overnight hours, circulation services, was
   used by 16\% of respondents. Regarding student responses about what
   services were not offered that they would have liked to have available,
   the researchers reveal that ``{[}f]ood and drink were overwhelmingly the
   most frequently requested services{''} (p.374), followed by a desire for
   more comfortable furniture and spaces. Some respondents also requested
   that late night hours be extended to seven days a week. Overall, 96\% of
   those submitting user feedback reported a sense of security, an
   important consideration for late night hours.
   Regarding the sample, researchers found that the population of late
   night library users closely reflected the overall university population.
   An independent samples t-test comparing the differences between the
   average GPA of late night users to the average GPA of the overall
   university population was statistically insignificant. For
   undergraduates only, there exists a small difference between the
   retention rate of students using late night hours (84.6\%) versus
   overall university retention rate (80.2\%). A Pearson's chi-squared test
   revealed a statistically significant association between late night
   library use and retention rates for both undergraduate and graduate
   populations when compared to the retention rates of non-late night users
   across the same student groups.
   Conclusion - This study reveals that undergraduate students in
   particular make use of late night hours for studying or other academic
   activities, and positions the late night model as a successful customer
   service offering at Kent State University. Although researchers do
   conclusively connect the availability of late night hours to student
   retention and academic success, their study points to the need for
   further research exploring this question.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 prompted higher education institutions in
   the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to switch to online learning for the
   safety of their citizens. The main purpose of this study is to determine
   the relationship between four indicators of digital learning experience
   and the intensity of student socio-pedagogical communication after the
   transition to distance learning. The data were collected from Ajman
   University, a private university in the UAE, during the spring of 2020.
   The sample consisted of 381 students who were surveyed using an online
   survey tool or email. First, this study found that the majority of
   students had access to digital tools and the Internet; however, a small
   number struggled with weak and unreliable Internet connection. Most
   students had a moderate to high ability to use digital technology, but
   some encountered difficulties and required assistance. Most students
   utilised digital communication tools for over five hours daily. The
   study also found a general lack of digital competency among students and
   difficulties in using digital tools for remote learning, highlighting
   the importance of investing in the development of digital skills. The
   study also found an intensification of social relationships and an
   increase in communication frequency between students and instructors;
   however, inadequate instructor-student communication remained a
   challenge. Finally, the multiple linear regression model showed that
   indicators such as the communication dimension of the lessons and the
   participatory nature of the courses positively impacted the intensity of
   student communication after the transition to distance learning.},

Abstract = {Cloud computing has become ubiquitous in modern life, and research. Your
   email is stored on the cloud and is accessible from anywhere on any
   smart device. Your music is streamed from a cloud source. You can store
   your images and videos on a cloud drive and expand the size of the drive
   instantly for a relatively small cost. You are increasingly using cloud
   applications such as Microsoft's Office 365, Adobe's Creative Cloud, and
   Esri's ArcGIS Online (AGOL) to create documents, graphics, and to
   perform spatial analyses. As a part of your research, you may be using
   cloud-computing resources such as Amazon's Web Services (AWS) or
   Microsoft's Azure platform. For analyses you may be using web services
   such as Esri's watershed delineation tool or the ever increasing number
   of tools available as ``science-as-a-service{''}.
   The cloud can provide many levels of functionality. Infrastructure as a
   Service (IaaS) is cloud-hosted hardware and you as the user are required
   to install the operating system and any applications you with to use.
   Platform as a Service (PaaS) provides the operating system but it is
   still necessary to install application or analysis tools. Software as a
   Service (SaaS) is software functionality that is delivered from a
   cloud-hosted source. Analysis as a Service (AaaS or SpatialAaaS) takes
   data or model parameters as an input, performs the full analysis in the
   cloud, and returns results to the user. Data as a Service (DaaS) is data
   that are stored in the cloud. The data may be static or they may be
   continually updated.
   Working in the cloud has many benefits - you have access to a variety of
   platforms and operating systems. You can specify the size of the
   platform you need, and you can expand and enlarge the platform on the
   fly if you find you need greater capacity. You can increase your storage
   on the fly without the need to depend upon IT personnel or local
   infrastructure. If you have access to a good internet connection, you
   have full access to your resources. Instead of having to fund the
   purchase of large, expensive, infrastructure, you can pay-as-you-go. You
   can try out new programs or applications in a smaller sandbox and then
   expand them to the size need for full production.
   Working in the cloud also has some potential challenges. While the
   pay-as-you-go model avoids upfront investment, it is also hard to align
   with governmental and other funding cycles that want a set cost for a
   set period of service. Providing a credit card to be charged against
   monthly does not fit well in these fiscal models. Especially for
   governmental users, there may be questions about the security of data or
   applications stored offsite. For large data sets that change frequently,
   it may be very hard to update the datasets to a cloud host quickly
   enough for operational use. With the cost of storage dropping
   continuously, it may actually be more expensive to store data in the
   cloud rather than on a local disk farm.},

Abstract = {Background. Evaluation of the quality of healthcare depends on measures
   of structures, processes and outcomes. Progress in recording data allows
   for better measures of processes, such as the completeness of clinical
   data, the performance of professional tasks and the use of checklists.
   Objectives. To report the results of a radiotherapy (RT) workflow audit
   and a subsequent online survey of user experience.
   Methods. The RT workflow audit was developed in 2016 and has been
   undertaken twice a year at 28 facilities or units, with a total of 32
   linear accelerators. Electronic patient folders were reviewed to assess
   the documentation of 90 task items, of which 64 were scored. The auditor
   came from another facility. The online survey took place in July 2020.
   It contained questions on the audit's process, professional value and
   future use. Invitations were sent by email to the 151 radiotherapist
   staff at the 28 units where the audit had been implemented. Responses
   were anonymous.
   Results. For the RT workflow audit, scores improved from 60\% in some
   units in 2016 to >90\% in all units for at least 2 years since 2018. The
   number of responders to the online survey was 58, giving a responder
   rate of 38\%. The margin of error of the results was 10\%. The audit's
   task items were considered appropriate by 77\% of responders, and
   feedback was reported by 78\% of them. The audit was considered very or
   extremely valuable to their unit's service delivery by 58\% of
   responders. Changes in the unit as a result of the audit were reported
   by 77\% of responders. The audit was very useful or extremely useful to
   75\% of responders in maintaining personal professional standards. The
   proportion of responders who were very or extremely supportive of
   continuing with the audit was 77\%. The comments in the online survey
   will be helpful for ongoing review of the RT workflow audit.
   Conclusions. The RT workflow audit extends the scope of accreditation
   audits by including measures of processes. Users of the audit evaluate
   its processes favourably and report that it has value both in their
   unit's clinical service and for their personal professional standards.
   The audit is effective in developing quality improvement programmes.},

Title = {The first Nitrogen Index app for mobile devices: Using portable
   technology for smart agricultural management},
Journal = {COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {91},
Pages = {121-123},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Nitrogen fertilizer from organic and inorganic sources is used across
   the world's agroecosystems. It contributes to higher yields and higher
   economic returns to farmers, and is essential for food security.
   However, when more is applied than necessary, significant amounts of
   nitrogen can exit the system and impact the environment. Appropriate
   nitrogen management, where the right amounts of nitrogen are applied and
   best practices are used to ensure higher use efficiency, is important
   for conservation. A recent study from the USDA reported that about 66\%
   of US cropland was not meeting all of three best management practices
   for nitrogen: best rate, best time of application, and best method of
   application
   (http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/err-economic-research-report/err12
   7.aspx). Nitrogen tools can help us assess the risk of nitrogen losses
   from a field to the environment and increase nitrogen use efficiencies
   (http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/sep11/nitrogen0911.htm). We need
   quick and mobile nitrogen management risk assessment tools that can be
   carried to the field and elsewhere. The first smartphone/tablet
   application (or ``app{''}) of the Nitrogen Index was released on
   February 26th, 2012. A PC (R) version(1) of the Nitrogen Index, which
   can be used on PC desktop and laptop computers, is also available, so
   users can email the results from their Nitrogen Index app developed for
   smartphones/tablets in the field to their computer back at the office
   (or a farmer's or consultant's computer) using their portable device's
   internet service. The Nitrogen Index smartphone/tablet application can
   be downloaded at no cost from the Google Play (TM) website
   (https://play.google.com/store) to any phone that has the Android no
   system. To find the application, the user simply needs to do a search at
   the Google Play website using ``Nitrogen Index{''} as the search term.
   This new advancement in portable technology will enable the use of small
   devices such as smartphones to conduct an assessment on site and visit
   with a farmer at any given field site where a wireless connection is
   available. The Nitrogen Index is a quick tool, and its assessments of
   nitrogen loss risk are correlated with observed values. This is the
   first Nitrogen Index app in the world and it is the beginning of more
   advances to come in the field of portable agricultural technology. New
   advances in software (e.g., apps) and technology are bringing us to a
   new frontier of technology transfer, and portable technologies (e.g.,
   smartphones, tablets) are making possible the development of `smart
   agriculture'. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {A Broader View of Risk to Health Care Workers: Perspectives on
   Supporting Vulnerable Health Care Professional Households During
   COVID-19 Comment},
Journal = {ACADEMIC MEDICINE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {96},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1233-1235},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted both that frontline workers face a
   new set of personal hazards in health care settings and that there are
   not well-established recommendations to address the broader risks to
   these workers and their families. Particularly vulnerable households
   include dual health care professional households, single-parent health
   care professional households, and households with health care
   professionals responsible for a highrisk family member (i.e., an older
   adult or immunocompromised person). While the demographics of these
   households are heterogeneous, it is expected that the professional and
   personal concerns specific to COVID-19 will be similar. These concerns
   include family safety, balancing full-time work with homebased schooling
   for children, the looming threat of illness to 1 or both partners, the
   potential of infecting high-risk family members, and the challenges of
   planning for the future during uncertain times. To elucidate these
   concerns in their department, the authors sought input from colleagues
   in dual health care professional households through an open-ended email
   communication. Respondents expressed a range of concerns centered on
   balancing professional and family responsibilities during the COVID-19
   pandemic. In this commentary, the authors propose several
   recommendations in the areas of support networks, leadership and
   culture, and operations and logistics that health care institutions can
   adopt to minimize the burden on these vulnerable households during
   states of emergency. The successful implementation of these
   recommendations hinges on creating a work environment in which all
   health care providers feel comfortable voicing their concerns.},

Title = {phishGILLNET-phishing detection methodology using probabilistic latent

Journal = {EURASIP JOURNAL ON INFORMATION SECURITY},
Year = {2012},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Identity theft is one of the most profitable crimes committed by felons.
   In the cyber space, this is commonly achieved using phishing. We propose
   here robust server side methodology to detect phishing attacks, called
   phishGILLNET, which incorporates the power of natural language
   processing and machine learning techniques. phishGILLNET is a
   multi-layered approach to detect phishing attacks. The first layer
   (phishGILLNET1) employs Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) to
   build a topic model. The topic model handles synonym (multiple words
   with similar meaning), polysemy (words with multiple meanings), and
   other linguistic variations found in phishing. Intentional misspelled
   words found in phishing are handled using Levenshtein editing and Google
   APIs for correction. Based on term document frequency matrix as input
   PLSA finds phishing and non-phishing topics using tempered expectation
   maximization. The performance of phishGILLNET1 is evaluated using PLSA
   fold in technique and the classification is achieved using Fisher
   similarity. The second layer of phishGILLNET (phishGILLNET2) employs
   AdaBoost to build a robust classifier. Using probability distributions
   of the best PLSA topics as features the classifier is built using
   AdaBoost. The third layer (phishGILLNET3) further expands phishGILLNET2
   by building a classifier from labeled and unlabeled examples by
   employing Co-Training. Experiments were conducted using one of the
   largest public corpus of email data containing 400,000 emails. Results
   show that phishGILLNET3 outperforms state of the art phishing detection
   methods and achieves F-measure of 100\%. Moreover, phishGILLNET3
   requires only a small percentage (10\%) of data be annotated thus saving
   significant time, labor, and avoiding errors incurred in human
   annotation.},

Title = {Transgender, Gender-Diverse, and Nonbinary Experiences in Physical
   Therapy: A Descriptive Qualitative Study},
Journal = {PHYSICAL THERAPY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {104},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT 30},
Abstract = {Objective. The objective was to explore experiences with and identify
   barriers and facilitators of utilizing physical therapy for people who
   identify as transgender, gender diverse, and nonbinary (TGNB). Methods.
   A qualitative descriptive design was employed using semistructured
   interviews conducted in New Zealand. Eligible participants were
   individuals who were 12 years old or older, who self-identified as TGNB,
   and who had accessed physical therapy at a community-based clinic that
   also provides a gender-affirming service. Participants were recruited
   via email invitation to the clinic database. Interview data were
   analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. Demographics are reported
   descriptively. Results. Seventeen individuals (15-64 years old and
   identifying as 11 different genders) participated. All participants
   reported physical therapy experiences relating to 1 or more of the
   following 4 themes: challenging cisnormativity at policy, environmental,
   clinic, and therapist levels; safety and trust throughout the clinical
   experience, including clinic credibility for being a safe provider,
   clinic displays of TGNB inclusivity, implementation of safe clinic
   processes, and respectful therapist interactions; inclusive experiences
   in a clinic that provided affordable care and took active steps to
   understand and affirm TGNB identities and with physical therapists who
   had a high level of knowledge of TGNB-specific health issues and took a
   biopsychosocial approach to care; and sensitivity to body discomfort or
   dysphoria triggers. Barriers to and facilitators of care were identified
   at policy, environmental, clinic, and therapist levels. Conclusion.
   People who identify as TGNB face challenges to accessing safe and
   culturally sensitive physical therapy. However, there are achievable
   areas for improvement at policy, environmental, clinic, and physical
   therapist levels to gain trust and engagement in care for the TGNB
   community. Impact. This study provides a detailed exploration of TGNB
   physical therapy experiences and identifies specific areas of
   improvement for TGNB physical therapy care to provide clinicians and
   physical therapy clinics insights into the provision of safe and
   culturally sensitive physical therapy.},

Title = {Models of Peer Support to Remediate Post-Intensive Care Syndrome: A
   Report Developed by the Society of Critical Care Medicine Thrive
   International Peer Support Collaborative},
Journal = {CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {47},
Number = {1},
Pages = {E21-E27},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Objectives: Patients and caregivers can experience a range of physical,
   psychologic, and cognitive problems following critical care discharge.
   The use of peer support has been proposed as an innovative support
   mechanism.
   Design: We sought to identify technical, safety, and procedural aspects
   of existing operational models of peer support, among the Society of
   Critical Care Medicine Thrive Peer Support Collaborative. We also sought
   to categorize key distinctions between these models and elucidate
   barriers and facilitators to implementation.
   Subjects and Setting: Seventeen Thrive sites from the United States,
   United Kingdom, and Australia were represented by a range of healthcare
   professionals.
   Measurements and Main Results: Via an iterative process of in-person and
   email/conference calls, members of the Collaborative defined the key
   areas on which peer support models could be defined and compared,
   collected detailed self-reports from all sites, reviewed the
   information, and identified clusters of models. Barriers and challenges
   to implementation of peer support models were also documented. Within
   the Thrive Collaborative, six general models of peer support were
   identified: community based, psychologist-led outpatient, models-based
   within ICU follow-up clinics, online, groups based within ICU, and peer
   mentor models. The most common barriers to implementation were
   recruitment to groups, personnel input and training, sustainability and
   funding, risk management, and measuring success.
   Conclusions: A number of different models of peer support are currently
   being developed to help patients and families recover and grow in the
   postcritical care setting.},

Title = {Integrating Regression and Boosting Techniques for Enhanced River Water
   Quality Monitoring in the Cauvery Basin: A Seasonal and Sustainable
   Approach},
Journal = {WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH},
Year = {2025},

Abstract = {This study addresses a critical research gap in water quality
   monitoring, specifically within the Cauvery River basin, where
   substantial contamination poses significant risks to both human health
   and aquatic ecosystems. The paper introduces an effective and
   sustainable river water quality monitoring system, termed MLRMC-WQM
   (Multiple Linear Regression and Multi-class CatBoost-based Water Quality
   Monitoring). The system leverages Linear Regression to predict basic
   water quality parameters based on straightforward relationships, while
   CatBoost refines these predictions by capturing more complex, nonlinear
   relationships. Various sensors are integrated with a Raspberry Pi-5,
   which collects readings at regular intervals. The Raspberry Pi-5 is
   equipped with wireless communication modules to transmit real-time data
   to cloud servers, where the information is stored and processed. Cloud
   platforms provide scalability, security, and accessibility for efficient
   data management. By incorporating energy-efficient and scalable
   technologies, the system minimizes environmental impact while ensuring
   long-term sustainability. If the system detects abnormal levels of
   pollutants, turbidity, or other parameters, it triggers automated alerts
   via SMS, email, or app notifications. The effectiveness of the MLRMC-WQM
   model is assessed using regression metrics, including Mean Absolute
   Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared (R2), and Mean
   Squared Error (MSE) to assess the accuracy of parameter predictions, and
   classification metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and F1-score to
   evaluate the effectiveness of water quality categorization. A
   comparative analysis with three state-of-the-art methods demonstrates
   that the MLRMC-WQM model achieves a validation accuracy of 97.92\%,
   outperforming the other methods. This study contributes a practical,
   technology-driven tool that bridges environmental science and
   decision-making. By enabling real-time, multi-faceted monitoring and
   promoting data-driven and timely interventions, the system supports
   sustainable water resource management, significantly enhancing efforts
   to conserve vital water resources and protect ecosystems.Summary A
   hybrid methodology has been proposed for effective river water quality
   monitoring. Real-time data collection has been conducted across multiple
   locations. Diverse water quality parameters have been measured and
   analyzed. Two distinct seasons have been analyzed to monitor water
   quality. The performance of MLRMC-WQM has been evaluated and compared
   with other machine learning techniques.},

Abstract = {Information leakage and counterfeiting are serious worldwide issues that
   tremendously impact legitimate businesses and human life. Inspired by
   the Noctiluca scintillans, a new fluorescence-afterglow dual-modal
   information encryption enabled by precisely coordination-modulated
   ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) is presented. Strikingly, the
   optical properties including fluorescence, lifetime and intensity of UOP
   can be precisely modulated on-demand through energy transfer by
   lanthanide (LnIII) coordination, which enables information camouflage by
   similar LnIII luminescence to provide misleading information along with
   data decryption in the form of mutual afterglow. Moreover, the important
   data can be encrypted in a spatial-time-resolved way by programmatically
   coding information with afterglow gradients, yielding greatly improved
   security for verifying the authenticity. This study provides a new
   avenue to precisely modulate the optical properties of UOP materials and
   broadens the scope of optical materials for innovative information
   encryption and anticounterfeiting applications.
   A conceptually new fluorescence-afterglow dual-modal information
   encryption is realized by using lanthanide (LnIII)-modulated UOP
   materials. The multicolor fluorescence is used for camouflaging
   information while LnIII-modulated UOP is applied for deciphering target
   data, leading to attacker-misleading encryption. Moreover, the resulting
   afterglow gradient is well suitable for spatial-time-resolved
   anti-counterfeiting applications, revealing largely improved security to
   verify the authenticity.image},

Title = {High workload and under-appreciation lead to burnout and low job
   satisfaction among radiographers},
Journal = {RADIOGRAPHY},

Volume = {31},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Introduction: Burnout and low job satisfaction in healthcare can impact
   patient safety and staff retention. This study aims to gain information
   on the factors influencing burnout and job satisfaction among
   radiographers in the UK, Ireland and internationally. This can inform
   strategies for improving the workforce supply and demand imbalance.
   Methods: An online questionnaire was developed, which included
   demographic questions and two validated instruments, the Maslach Burnout
   Inventory (MBI) and the Job Satisfaction Survey (JSS). The questionnaire
   was distributed to diagnostic radiographers through the EFRS Research
   Hub at the European Congress of Radiology, Vienna, in early March 2023.
   It was disseminated online through Twitter, Facebook, and email over six
   weeks. Results: 245 radiographers completed the questionnaire, with the
   majority (n = 207, 84.5 \%) female. Not all respondents responded to all
   questions. The numbers of respondents for each section were: Pay n =
   205, Promotion = 206, supervision = 212, fringe benefits = 211, CR =
   212, OC = 214, Coworkers = 213, NoW = 211, Communication = 213 and
   overall JS = 205. The questionnaire had participants from twenty-one
   countries, with 66.5 \% from Ireland. The mean values for emotional
   exhaustion (EE), depersonalisation (DP) and personal accomplishment (PA)
   indicate moderate levels of burnout among responding radiographers. 44.2
   \% of radiographers were dissatisfied, 43.7 \% were ambivalent, and 12.1
   \% were satisfied overall. Workload, under-appreciated work, and time
   pressures were ranked as the top three factors contributing to burnout.
   Staff numbers, workload and poor management were the top three factors
   reducing job satisfaction. Conclusion: Burnout levels were moderate, and
   overall job satisfaction was very low among radiographers. Workload and
   under-appreciation were key factors impacting low job satisfaction and
   high burnout. Implications for practice: Healthcare policies that
   address radiographer burnout through wage structure adjustments,
   targeted human capital investment, and management practices aligned with
   staff needs are needed. Implementing these strategies is essential for
   improving healthcare efficiency, staff wellbeing, and patient care
   outcomes. (c) 2024 The College of Radiographers. Published by Elsevier

Title = {Mobile phone messaging for communicating results of medical
   investigations},
Journal = {COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS},
Year = {2012},
Number = {6},
Abstract = {Background
   Mobile phone messaging, such as Short Message Service (SMS) and
   Multimedia Message Service (MMS), has rapidly grown into a mode of
   communication with a wide range of applications, including communicating
   the results from medical investigations to patients. Alternative modes
   of communication of results include face-to-face communication, postal
   messages, calls to landlines or mobile phones, through web-based health
   records and email. Possible advantages of mobile phone messaging include
   convenience to both patients and healthcare providers, reduced waiting
   times for health services and healthcare costs.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects of mobile phone messaging for communicating
   results of medical investigations, on people's healthcare-seeking
   behaviour and health outcomes. Secondary objectives include assessment
   of participants' evaluation of the intervention, direct and indirect
   healthcare costs and possible risks and harms associated with the
   intervention.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL,
   The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to
   June 2009), EMBASE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), PsycINFO
   (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (January 1993
   to June 2009), LILACS (January 1993 to June 2009) and African Health
   Anthology (January 1993 to June 2009). We also reviewed grey literature
   (including trial registers) and reference lists of articles.
   Selection criteria
   We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised
   controlled trials (QRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, or
   interrupted time series (ITS) studies with at least three time points
   before and after the intervention. We included studies assessing mobile
   phone messaging for communicating results of medical tests, between a
   healthcare provider or `treatment buddy' and patient. We only included
   studies in which it was possible to assess the effects of mobile phone
   messaging independent of other technologies or interventions.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently assessed all studies against the
   inclusion criteria, with any disagreements resolved by a third review
   author. Study design features, characteristics of target populations,
   interventions and controls, and results data were extracted by two
   review authors and confirmed by a third. Primary outcomes of interest
   were health outcomes and healthcare utilisation as a result of the
   intervention. We also considered patients' and providers' evaluation of
   the intervention, perceptions of safety, costs and potential harms or
   adverse effects of the intervention.
   Main results
   We included one randomised controlled trial involving 2782 participants.
   The study investigated the effects of mobile phone messaging in
   alleviating anxiety in women waiting for prenatal biochemical screening
   results for Down syndrome, by providing fast reporting of results before
   a follow-up appointment. The study measured health outcomes using the
   Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), which includes a scale
   (20 to 80 points, higher score indicates higher anxiety) to describe how
   the respondent feels at a particular moment in time (state anxiety). The
   study, which was at high risk of bias, found that women who had received
   their test result early by text message had a mean anxiety score 2.48
   points lower than women who had not yet received their result (95\% CI
   -8.79 to 3.84). Women with a serum-negative test result receiving their
   result early had a mean anxiety score 5.3 points lower (95\% CI -5.99 to
   -4.61) than women in the control group. Women with a serum-positive test
   result receiving their result early by text message had a mean anxiety
   score 1.2 points higher (95\% CI -3.48 to 5.88) than women in the
   control group. The evidence was of low quality due to high risk of bias
   in the included study, and the fact that the evidence comes from one
   study only. The study did not report on other outcomes of interest, such
   as patient satisfaction, adverse events or cost.
   Authors' conclusions
   We found very limited evidence of low quality that communicating results
   of medical investigations by mobile phone messaging may make little or
   no difference to women's anxiety overall or in women with positive test
   results, but may reduce anxiety in women with negative test results.
   However, with only one study included in this review, this evidence is
   insufficient to inform recommendations at this time. More research is
   needed on the effectiveness and user evaluation of these interventions.
   In particular, more research should be conducted into the potential
   risks and limitations of these interventions.},

Title = {Effectiveness of an eHealth self-management tool for older adults with
   multimorbidity (KeepWell): protocol for a hybrid
   effectiveness-implementation randomised controlled trial},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Introduction In response to the burden of chronic disease among older
   adults, different chronic disease self-management tools have been
   created to optimise disease management. However, these seldom consider
   all aspects of disease management are not usually developed specifically
   for seniors or created for sustained use and are primarily focused on a
   single disease. We created an eHealth self-management application called
   `KeepWell' that supports seniors with complex care needs in their homes.
   It incorporates the care for two or more chronic conditions from among
   the most prevalent high-burden chronic diseases.
   Methods and analysis We will evaluate the effectiveness, cost and uptake
   of KeepWell in a 6-month, pragmatic, hybrid effectiveness-implementation
   randomised controlled trial. Older adults age >= 65 years with one or
   more chronic conditions who are English speaking are able to consent and
   have access to a computer or tablet device, internet and an email
   address will be eligible. All consenting participants will be randomly
   assigned to KeepWell or control. The allocation sequence will be
   determined using a random number generator. Primary outcome is perceived
   self-efficacy at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include quality of life,
   health background/status, lifestyle (nutrition, physical activity,
   caffeine, alcohol, smoking and bladder health), social engagement and
   connections, eHealth literacy; all collected via a Health Risk
   Questionnaire embedded within KeepWell (intervention) or a survey
   platform (control). Implementation outcomes will include reach,
   effectiveness, adoption, fidelity, implementation cost and
   sustainability.
   Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval has been received from the
   North York General Hospital Research and Ethics Board. The study is
   funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Ontario
   Ministry of Health. We will work with our team to develop a
   dissemination strategy which will include publications, presentations,
   plain language summaries and an end-of-grant meeting.},

Volume = {50},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Objective To investigate risk, risk factors and effects on adherence to
   adequate clinical standards, of burnout and depression in veterinary
   anaesthesia residents.Study design Closed online cross-sectional survey
   study.Study population A sample of 89 residents registered to the
   European and/or the American Colleges of Veterinary An (ae)sthesia and
   Analgesia out of a total of 185.Methods A link to access an online
   questionnaire, which included the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human
   Services Survey (MBI-HSS), the Harvard National Depression Screening Day
   Scale (HANDS) and 28 questions developed to assess adherence to adequate
   clinical standards, was sent by email to 185 residents. The three
   components of the MBI-HSS namely emotional exhaustion (EE),
   deper-sonalization and reduced personal accomplishment were analysed
   separately. Analysis of proportions and two-step regression statistical
   modelling were used for data anal-ysis, and p values < 0.05 were
   considered statistically significant.Results The response rate was 48\%.
   Based on HANDS and MBI-HSS scores, 49\% of the residents were at high
   risk of both depression and burnout. These residents expressed greater
   concern of delivering inadequate animal care (p < 0.001), of decreased
   quality of supervision during COVID-19 (p = 0.038) and of negative
   impact of the pandemic on their training programme (p = 0.002) than
   residents at low-to-moderate risk. Working in a clinical environment for
   > 60 hours/week was a risk factor for both depression (p = 0.016) and EE
   (p = 0.022), while female sex was a risk factor for EE only (p =
   0.018).Conclusions and clinical relevance A large proportion of
   residents is at high risk of depression and burnout, a sce-nario likely
   worsened by the pandemic. The findings of this study suggest that
   reducing the clinical workload and increasing the level of support and
   supervision may help to improve residents' mental health.},

Title = {Atomic spectrometry update. Environmental analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL ATOMIC SPECTROMETRY},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {103-141},
Abstract = {This is the twenty-fifth annual review published in JAAS on the
   application of atomic spectrometry to the chemical analysis of
   environmental samples. This Update refers to papers published
   approximately between September 2008 and August 2009. In the analysis of
   air, work has focused on: the need to collect and characterise
   ultrafines; determination of elements such as Be, Hg and PGEs in air
   samples; application of SRXRF techniques and advances in the development
   of field deployable aerosol mass spectrometry systems. In the analysis
   of water, significant areas of activity currently focus on elemental
   speciation of As, Cr, Hg and Sn. Work in increasing method sensitivities
   through the use of vapour generation and optimization of extraction and
   preconcentration procedures continues. The increased global awareness of
   the need to monitor levels of potentially toxic elements (PTE) in soils
   is desirable and this is reflected in a growing body of published
   literature from authors in the Middle East, Asia and Africa. However, a
   potential criticism of some studies is that they simply report the
   concentrations of analytes in particular soils or plants, without
   providing sufficient information on analytical quality control and with
   little assessment of their environmental significance, e. g. those
   levels that are a threat to human health. In the field of geological
   analysis, considerable effort is being spent not only on the production,
   characterization and certification of new geological reference
   materials, but also on enhancing the certification of existing reference
   materials and the development of reference materials with assigned
   elemental isotopic ratios. Laser ablation continues to go from strength
   to strength in being adopted as a solid sampling tool in geochemical
   analysis. Feedback on this review is most welcome and the lead author
   can be contacted using the email address provided.},

Title = {A Survey of Provider Attitudes, Beliefs, and Perceived Barriers
   Regarding a Centralized Direct-Mail Colorectal Cancer Screening Approach
   at Community Health Centers},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PRIMARY CARE AND COMMUNITY HEALTH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: Colorectal cancer screening (CRC) rates are low,
   particularly among individuals with low socioeconomic status. Organized
   CRC screening programs have demonstrated success in increasing screening
   rates. Little is known about provider attitudes, beliefs, and practices
   related to CRC screening or how they are influenced by an organized CRC
   screening program. Methods: In 2014 and 2016, providers from 26 safety
   net clinics in Oregon and Northern California were invited to complete
   baseline and follow-up online surveys for the Strategies and
   Opportunities to Stop Colon Cancer in Priority Populations (STOP CRC)
   study. The provider survey link was sent electronically to primary care
   providers serving adult patients. Providers were sent reminders every 2
   weeks via email to complete the survey, up to 3 reminders total. In this
   article, we describe learnings about provider attitudes, beliefs, and
   practices related to CRC screening after implementation of the STOP CRC
   program. Results: A total of 166 unique providers completed baseline
   and/or follow-up surveys, representing 228 responses. Main themes
   included (1) favorable shifts in attitude toward fecal immunochemical
   test (FIT) and direct-mail cancer screening programs, (2) changes in
   provider perception of key barriers, and (3) growing interest in
   centralized automated systems for identifying patients due for CRC
   screening and eligible for population-based outreach. Discussion:
   Providers are interested in improved information systems for identifying
   patients due for CRC screening and delivering population-based outreach
   (ie, to distribute FIT kits outside of the clinic visit) to help reduce
   health system- and patient-level barriers to screening.},

Title = {Detection of novel therapies using a multi-national, multi-institutional
   registry of cutaneous immune-related adverse events and management},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {62},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1020-1025},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background Cutaneous immune-related adverse events (cirAEs) remain a
   prevalent and common sequelae of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)
   therapy, often necessitating treatment interruption and prolonged immune
   suppression. Treatment algorithms are still poorly defined, based on
   single-institution case reports without adequate safety assessments, and
   subject to publication bias.Methods Data in this registry were collected
   through a standardized REDCap form distributed to dermatologists via
   email listserv.Results Ninety-seven cirAEs were reported from 13
   institutions in this registry. Topical and systemic steroids were the
   most common treatments used; however, targeted treatment matched to
   disease morphology was identified at numerous sites. Novel cirAE therapy
   uses that to our knowledge have not been previously described were
   captured including tacrolimus for the treatment of follicular, bullous,
   and eczematous eruptions and phototherapy for eczematous eruptions.
   Moreover, further evidence of cirAE treatment applications sparsely
   described in literature were also captured in this study including
   dupilumab and rituximab for bullous eruptions, phototherapy for
   lichenoid and psoriasiform eruptions, and acitretin for psoriasiform
   eruptions, among others. No serious adverse events were reported.
   Numerous targeted therapeutics including dupilumab, rituximab, and
   psoriasis biologics, among others, were associated with a cirAE grade
   improvement of =2 grades in every patient treated.Conclusion This study
   suggests that a multi-institutional registry of cirAEs and management is
   not only feasible but that the information collected can be used to
   detect, evaluate, and rigorously assess targeted treatments for cirAEs.
   Further expansion and modification to include treatment progression may
   allow for sufficient data for specific treatment recommendations to be
   made.},

Title = {Detection, identification and alert of wild animals in surveillance
   videos using deep learning},
Journal = {CURRENT SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {127},

Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {PurposeWith the rapid advancement of lifestyle and technology, human
   lives are becoming increasingly threatened. Accidents, exposure to
   dangerous substances and animal strikes are all possible threats. Human
   lives are increasingly being harmed as a result of attacks by wild
   animals. Further investigation into the cases reported revealed that
   such events can be detected early on. Techniques such as machine
   learning and deep learning will be used to solve this challenge. The
   upgraded VGG-16 model with deep learning-based detection is appropriate
   for such real-time applications because it overcomes the low accuracy
   and poor real-time performance of traditional detection methods and
   detects medium- and long-distance objects more accurately. Many
   organizations use various safety and security measures, particularly
   CCTV/video surveillance systems, to address physical security concerns.
   CCTV/video monitoring systems are quite good at visually detecting a
   range of attacks associated with suspicious behavior on the premises and
   in the workplace. Many have indeed begun to use automated systems such
   as video analytics solutions such as motion detection, object/perimeter
   detection, face recognition and artificial intelligence/machine
   learning, among others. Anomaly identification can be performed with the
   data collected from the CCTV cameras. The camera surveillance can
   generate enormous quantities of data, which is laborious and expensive
   to screen for the species of interest. Many cases have been recorded
   where wild animals enter public places, causing havoc and damaging lives
   and property. There are many cases where people have lost their lives to
   wild attacks. The conventional approach of sifting through images by eye
   can be expensive and risky. Therefore, an automated wild animal
   detection system is required to avoid these
   circumstances.Design/methodology/approachThe proposed system consists of
   a wild animal detection module, a classifier and an alarm module, for
   which video frames are fed as input and the output is prediction
   results. Frames extracted from videos are pre-processed and then
   delivered to the neural network classifier as filtered frames. The
   classifier module categorizes the identified animal into one of the
   several categories. An email or WhatsApp notice is issued to the
   appropriate authorities or users based on the classifier
   outcome.FindingsEvaluation metrics are used to assess the quality of a
   statistical or machine learning model. Any system will include a review
   of machine learning models or algorithms. A number of evaluation
   measures can be performed to put a model to the test. Among them are
   classification accuracy, logarithmic loss, confusion matrix and other
   metrics. The model must be evaluated using a range of evaluation
   metrics. This is because a model may perform well when one measurement
   from one evaluation metric is used but perform poorly when another
   measurement from another evaluation metric is used. We must utilize
   evaluation metrics to guarantee that the model is running correctly and
   optimally.Originality/valueThe output of conv5 3 will be of size
   7{*}7{*}512 in the ImageNet VGG-16 in Figure 4, which operates on images
   of size 224{*}224{*}3. Therefore, the parameters of fc6 with a flattened
   input size of 7{*}7{*}512 and an output size of 4,096 are 4,096,
   7{*}7{*}512. With reshaped parameters of dimensions 4,096{*}7{*}7{*}512,
   the comparable convolutional layer conv6 has a 7{*}7 kernel size and
   4,096 output channels. The parameters of fc7 with an input size of 4,096
   (i.e.
   the output size of fc6) and an output size of 4,096 are 4,096, 4,096.
   The input can be thought of as a one-of-a-kind image with 4,096 input
   channels. With reshaped parameters of dimensions 4,096{*}1{*}1{*}4,096,
   the comparable convolutional layer conv7 has a 1{*}1 kernel size and
   4,096 output channels. It is clear that conv6 has 4,096 filters, each
   with dimensions 7{*}7{*}512, and conv7 has 4,096 filters, each with
   dimensions 1{*}1{*}4,096. These filters are numerous, large and
   computationally expensive. To remedy this, the authors opt to reduce
   both their number and the size of each filter by subsampling parameters
   from the converted convolutional layers. Conv6 will use 1,024 filters,
   each with dimensions 3{*}3{*}512. Therefore, the parameters are
   subsampled from 4,096{*}7{*}7{*}512 to 1,024{*}3{*}3{*}512. Conv7 will
   use 1,024 filters, each with dimensions 1{*}1{*}1,024. Therefore, the
   parameters are subsampled from 4,096{*}1{*}1{*}4,096 to
   1,024{*}1{*}1{*}1,024.},

Title = {Bioinspired Hierarchical Multi-Protective Membrane for Extreme
   Environments via Co-Electrospinning-Electrospray Strategy},
Journal = {SMALL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Extreme environments can cause severe harm to human health, and even
   threaten life safety. Lightweight, breathable clothing with
   multi-protective functions would be of great application value. However,
   integrating multi-protective functions into nanofibers in a facile way
   remains a great challenge. Here, a one-step
   co-electrospinning-electrospray strategy is developed to fabricate a
   superhydrophobic multi-protective membrane (S-MPM). The water contact
   angle of S-MPM can reach up to 164.3 degrees. More importantly, S-MPM
   can resist the skin temperature drop (11.2 degrees C) or increase (17.2
   degrees C) caused by 0 degrees C cold or 70 degrees C hot compared with
   pure electrospun membrane. In the cold climate (-5 degrees C), the
   anti-icing time of the S-MPM is extended by 2.52 times, while the
   deicing time is only 1.45 s due to the great photothermal effect. In a
   fire disaster situation, the total heat release and peak heat release
   rate values of flame retarded S-MPM drop sharply by 24.2\% and 69.3\%,
   respectively. The S-MPM will serve as the last line of defense for the
   human body and has the potential to trigger a revolution in the
   practical application of next-generation functional clothing.
   A superhydrophobic multi-protective membrane is achieved by the one-step
   co-electrospinning-electrospray (Co-ESS) strategy to protect human life
   and health in extreme environments.image},

Title = {Induced Abortion Provision Among a National Sample of
   Obstetrician-Gynecologists},
Journal = {OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {133},
Number = {3},
Pages = {477-483},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the proportion of obstetrician-gynecologists
   (ob-gyns) who provided induced abortion in the prior year, disaggregated
   by surgical and medication methods, and document barriers to provision
   of medication abortion.
   METHODS: In 2016-2017, we conducted a crosssectional survey of a
   national sample of American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
   Fellows and Junior Fellows who were part of the Collaborative Ambulatory
   Research Network. We sent the survey by email, and mailed nonresponders
   paper surveys. We performed descriptive statistics, chi(2) tests, and
   logistic regression analyses.
   RESULTS: Sixty-seven percent (655/980) of Collaborative Ambulatory
   Research Network members responded. Ninety-nine percent reported seeing
   patients of reproductive age, and 72\% reported having a patient in the
   prior year who needed or wanted an abortion. Among those seeing patients
   of reproductive age, 23.8\% (95\% CI 20.5\%-27.4\%) reported performing
   an induced abortion in the prior year; 10.4\% provided surgical and
   medication abortion, 9.4\% surgical only, and 4.0\% medication only. In
   multivariable analysis, physicians practicing in the Midwest (adjusted
   odds ratio {[}AOR] 0.31, 95\% CI 0.16-0.60) or South (AOR 0.22, 95\% CI
   0.11-0.42) had lower odds of provision compared with those practicing in
   the Northeast, whereas those practicing in an urban inner city (AOR
   2.71, 95\% CI 1.31-5.60) or urban non-innercity area (AOR 2.89, 95\% CI
   1.48-5.64 vs midsize towns, rural areas, or military settings) had
   higher odds of provision. The most common reasons for not providing
   medication abortion were personal beliefs (34\%) and practice
   restrictions (19\%). Among those not providing medication abortion, 28\%
   said they would if they could write a prescription for mifepristone.
   CONCLUSION: Compared with the previous national survey in 2008-2009,
   abortion provision may be increasing among practicing ob-gyns, although
   important geographic disparities persist. Few provide medication
   abortion, but uptake might increase if mifepristone could be prescribed.},

Title = {Mapping Research Priorities for Climate Change Adaptation in
   Agriculture: A One Health Perspective},
Journal = {WORKPLACE HEALTH \& SAFETY},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 MAY 13},
Abstract = {Background: The climate emergency poses significant threats to
   agricultural productivity, the health and economic prospects of
   agricultural workers, and animal welfare. This requires development and
   implementation of adaptation strategies to mitigate the impact in the
   long-term. The purpose of this study was to identify and map research
   priorities for climate change adaptation in agriculture, focusing on
   protecting the health of agricultural workers and livestock
   animals.Methods: Based on the One Health framework, we utilized a
   participatory, mixed-method approach called group concept mapping. In
   2023, 20 faculty members from various disciplines at a land-grant
   university were recruited through email and purposive sampling, based on
   group concept mapping methodology. Fifteen faculty members brainstormed
   ways to reduce health risks for agricultural workers and livestock in
   the Pacific Northwest amid climate change. Forty ideas were sorted and
   rated for importance and feasibility by 11 and 10 faculty,
   respectively.Findings: Multidimensional scaling yielded five clusters:
   wildfire smoke impacts, basic science, forecasting extreme weather,
   tradeoffs, and occupational health and labor. Key research areas include
   studying wildfire smoke's effects on agricultural products, animals, and
   workers, and identifying adaptive strategies for climate change's impact
   on humans and livestock. Overall, 25\% included all three pillars of the
   One Health framework.Conclusions: Most research directions were focused
   on risk management, with limited emphasis on the One Health
   framework.Application to Practice: Transdisciplinary collaboration is
   needed to apply a One Health approach in climate adaptation efforts for
   agriculture and can be enhanced through transdisciplinary education and
   training opportunities.},

Title = {Relationship between the use of nonpharmaceutical interventions and
   COVID-19 vaccination among US child care providers: A prospective cohort
   study},
Journal = {VACCINE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {40},
Number = {31},
Pages = {4098-4104},
Month = {JUL 29},
Abstract = {Background: The relationship between the use of nonpharmaceutical
   interventions and COVID-19 vaccination among U.S. child care providers
   remains unknown. If unvaccinated child care providers are also less
   likely to employ nonpharmaceutical interventions, then a vaccine mandate
   across child care programs may have larger health and safety benefits.
   Methods: To assess and quantify the relationship between the use of
   nonpharmaceutical interventions and COVID-19 vaccination among U.S.
   child care providers, we conducted a prospective cohort study of child
   care providers (N = 20,013) from all 50 states, the District of
   Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Child care providers were asked to complete a
   self-administered email survey in May-June 2020 assessing the use of
   nonpharmaceutical interventions (predictors) and a follow-up survey in
   May-June 2021 assessing COVID-19 vaccination (outcome).
   Nonpharmaceutical interventions were dichotomized as personal mitigation
   measures (e.g., masking, social distancing, handwashing) and classroom
   mitigation measures (e.g., temperature checks of staff/children, symptom
   screening for staff/children, cohorting).
   Results: For each unendorsed personal mitigation measure during 2020,
   the likelihood of vaccination in 2021 decreased by 7\% (Risk Ratio =
   0.93 {[}95\% CI 0.93 - 0.95]). No significant association was found
   between classroom mitigation measures and child care provider
   vaccination (Risk Ratio = 1.01 {[}95\% CI 1.00-1.01]).
   Conclusions: Child care providers who used fewer personal mitigation
   measures were also less likely to get vaccinated for COVID-19 as an
   alternative form of protection. The combined nonadherence to multiple
   types of preventative health behaviors, that is, both nonpharmaceutical
   interventions and vaccination, among some child care providers may
   support a role for mandatory vaccination to achieve pandemic control.

Abstract = {This article examines the interwoven relationship between article 1F
   (the exclusion provision) of the 1951 Refugee Convention and the
   inadmissibility scheme based on the grounds of security, violation of
   human or international rights, serious criminality, or organized
   criminality (SHSO) in Canada. Incorporating evidence from a literature
   review, case law, statistics, and interviews conducted with
   practitioners in Canada, this research demonstrates that Canada
   deliberately chooses to review the cases of refugee claimants about whom
   there are serious reasons to consider that they have committed grave
   crimes under the inadmissibility scheme rather than under article 1F.
   Accordingly, the article argues that the exclusion provision in Canada,
   through practice and with an intentional design, has turned into the
   inadmissibility proceeding. This shift from the exclusion provision to
   the inadmissibility scheme is problematic since using the broader SHSO
   grounds instead of article 1F violates Canada's international
   obligations under the Refugee Convention.},

Abstract = {Objectives. This study aimed to examine the influence of office noise
   and multitasking on decision confidence, overconfidence, satisfaction,
   calibration and affective well-being. Detrimental effects of noise and
   multitasking on perceived annoyance and concentration are well
   documented. Little is known about whether decision confidence and
   well-being during decisions are also affected. Methods. The study was a
   between-subjects laboratory experiment (n = 109) involving a noise
   condition with office noise presented through headphones (A-weighted
   equivalent sound pressure level of LAeq = 60 dB), a multitasking
   condition with an email-sorting task as the primary task and a control
   condition. Results. Compared to the control condition, subjects in the
   noise and multitasking conditions exhibited overestimation of
   confidence. There was also a significant decrease in well-being for
   people in the noise condition. Calibration was not affected. Conclusion.
   In the case of noise, well-being is affected even before the thresholds
   of workplace legislation are reached. Undue overconfidence can have
   detrimental effects upon subsequent decisions and risk-taking. Findings
   suggest that there should be greater consideration of environmental
   influences during decision-making in work environments.},

Title = {Global demand for rice genetic resources},
Journal = {CABI AGRICULTURE AND BIOSCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 4},
Abstract = {BackgroundThe International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) holds in
   trust the world's largest collection of rice diversity, with more than
   130,000 accessions of cultivated rice and wild species. Between 2012 and
   2018, a total of 2174 requests for rice germplasm were received from
   more than 1000 unique requestors. We documented and analyzed how
   genebank users made use of germplasm from IRRI. As we address food and
   nutrition security challenges in a changing context, we are motivated by
   the need to enhance the conservation, management, and use of rice
   genetic resources.MethodsWe examined the patterns of use of the IRRI
   genebank using distribution data and analyzed the results from a survey
   of germplasm recipients. The 2019 IRRI genebank user survey is the most
   recent attempt to obtain structured feedback from genebank end-users in
   multiple countries on their use of rice germplasm since 1995. We
   received 244 responses (a 35\% response rate) out of the complete list
   of 694 respondents with valid email addresses. We also tested the
   relationship between the availability of germplasm information, proxied
   by the passport data completeness index (PDCI), and the demand for rice
   accessions, measured by the number of requests for each unique accession
   using a Negative Binomial regression model. We hypothesized that
   materials that are better documented are more frequently requested by
   users because they offer more useful information for targeted research
   and breeding.ResultsBetween 2012 and 2018, requests for germplasm from
   outside IRRI were received from 63 countries in all regions of the
   world, mostly from Asia. IRRI distributed germplasm externally to
   requestors from universities (32\%), national research programs (14\%),
   private companies (9\%), and individuals, including farmers (24\%) as
   well as other CGIAR centers (3\%). The traits sought most often were
   tolerances to environmental stresses, followed by tolerance or
   resistance to biotic stresses. The majority of survey respondents
   confirmed the usefulness of IRRI germplasm for research, breeding,
   characterization, and evaluation. The analytical model confirmed the
   significant positive relationship between PDCI values and the demand for
   those accessions. The results indicated that improving the availability
   of information at the accession level will enhance the use of those
   materials. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to show
   the empirical link between documentation and use of
   germplasm.ConclusionsThe findings demonstrate the crucial role of IRRI's
   genebank as a key germplasm source for global rice research and
   development, with important implications for the conservation and use of
   rice genetic diversity in the future. Public sector organizations and
   the scientific community in general benefit from the conservation and
   availability of rice genetic resources. We also show the importance of
   the availability of data on conserved accession to enhance their use. To
   sustain the benefits, continuous investment in genebanks is needed to
   allow them to adapt to changes in technology and agricultural context.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper introduces a tractor rollover detection and emergency
   reporting software application, Safe Driving, developed for LOS-based
   mobile electronic devices (smartphones and tablet computers). The
   SafeDriving application uses a mathematical model to calculate the
   stability of a tractor using the physical parameters of the tractor and
   the data from the inbuilt sensors of the mobile electronic devices or
   the data from the external sensors attached to the tractor. When the
   SafeDriving application detects an accident, it sends automated email
   and phone messages with the GPS location, date, time and other critical
   information. The functions of the SafeDriving application were tested on
   a small-scale model tractor in laboratory conditions and on a 45 HP
   utility tractor in field conditions. The field-upset tests with the
   utility tractor were conducted for 10 times at 10.8 km/h and 21.6 km/h.
   During all of the tests, the application successfully monitored the
   vehicle stability and reported the accidents to the emergency contacts
   when a rollover accident happened. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Recruitment and retention strategies for public sector optometrists in
   KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa},
Journal = {AFRICAN VISION AND EYE HEALTH JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {75},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 20},
Abstract = {Background: In South Africa, there is a paucity of optometrists serving
   the needs of the larger public sector. KwaZulu-Natal is one of the most
   densely populated provinces and home to several of the poorest
   districts. Despite an optometry school in the province, and with a lack
   of compulsory community service for new graduates, more optometrists are
   needed to serve the public sector. While studies on the recruitment and
   retention of medical and allied health professionals have been
   conducted, limited evidence exists on work trends of public sector
   optometrists.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study design using both quantitative and
   qualitative data collection methods was used. All public sector
   optometrists and local district health co-ordinators in the province
   were contacted, with an 80\% (41 out of 51) and 75\% (9 out of 12)
   response rate, respectively. Questionnaires containing demographic,
   recruitment, retention and open-ended questions were distributed by
   post, fax and email and via an online survey to both groups. Telephonic
   interviews were also conducted using semi-structured techniques.
   Frequency distributions, Fisher's exact test and odds ratios were used
   to statistically describe the demographic data, while qualitative
   responses were recorded and analysed for commonly occurring themes.
   Results: The present public sector optometry workforce comprises mainly
   young (73\%), black (70\%), women (66\%). They chose to work in the
   public sector to `make a difference' and were attracted by `good working
   hours' and `job security'. Fifty-three percent of optometrists work in
   the public sector due to a study bursary, for which there was a
   statistically significant association for race (p = 0.01), gender (p =
   0.05) and background origin (p = 0.05). To aid their retention in public
   service, improved salaries, career progression, recognition, improved
   management relations and improved instrumentation were ranked highest by
   these optometrists.
   Conclusion: The demographic profile of presently serving public sector
   optometrists poses many human resource (HR) challenges and
   opportunities. Universities should pay attention to rural origin of
   students and provide exposure to rural clinical experiences during
   study. Departments of Health use study bursary incentives to recruit
   optometrists, but need to consider financial and non-financial
   incentives for their retention. At hospital level, a responsive HR
   management system should be implemented with emphasis on career
   management, recognition, improving infrastructure and supporting
   professional development.},

Abstract = {Objective To (i) identify person, vehicle and environmental risk factors
   for injury among children using motorcycles, and (ii) identify and
   appraise studies of interventions designed to reduce the occurrence or
   severity of injury among children using these vehicles.
   Method A systematic approach was used to collate data from published and
   grey literature globally on risk factors for motorcycles injury, and
   studies reporting evaluation of interventions to counter this injury.
   Academic data sets and public search engines (including Google and
   Yahoo!) were used. Websites of major conferences, organisations and
   networks were also searched. Finally, researchers and units working in
   this area were also contacted by email or phone seeking relevant
   research. All study types were eligible, excluding clinical case
   studies. The Haddon Matrix was used as a framework for synthesising the
   data.
   Results The review revealed that robust investigations of risk factors
   for injury among children using motorcycles are relatively scarce, and
   there are few interventional studies reporting effectiveness of
   countermeasures to this problem. Epidemiological literature is generally
   limited to discussion of human factors, and less attention has been
   given to vehicle and environmental factors. Furthermore, much of the
   literature is commentaries and descriptive studies. There has been
   little rigorous study of risk factors unique to children riding
   motorcycles.
   Conclusions This first attempt at extensively reviewing literature
   related to risk factors and interventions for children and motorcycles
   using the Haddon Matrix as a framework clearly highlights need for more
   rigorous study as information is lacking in all cells of this matrix.},

Title = {Treatment of endometriosis with dienogest in combination with
   traditional Chinese medicine: A systematic review and meta-analysis},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SURGERY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Background: Endometriosis is now considered to be a systemic disease
   rather than a disease that primarily affects the pelvis. Dienogest (DNG)
   has unique advantages in the treatment of endometriosis, but it also has
   side effects. Alternatively, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been
   used for over 2000 years in the treatment and prevention of disease and
   growing numbers of Chinese scholars are experimenting with the combined
   use of Dienogest and TCM for endometriosis treatment. Objectives: This
   review evaluated the efficacy and safety of TCM in combination with
   Dienogest in the treatment of endometriosis through meta-analysis.
   Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science,
   China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Journal Integration Platform,
   and Wanfang were used in literature searches, with a deadline of May 31,
   2022. Literature quality was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration
   ``risk of bias `` (ROB2) tool, and the ``meta `` package of R software
   v.4.1 was used for meta-analysis. Dichotomous variables and continuous
   variables were assessed using the relative risk (RR) and 95\% confidence
   intervals (95\% CI); standard mean differences (MD) and 95\% CI,
   respectively. Results: Twelve human randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
   and one retrospective study, all 13 written in the Chinese language,
   were included in the meta-analysis (720 experiments and 719 controls).
   The result indicated that TCM plus Dienogest was superior to
   Dienogest/TCM alone in increasing the cure rates (RR = 1.3780; 95\% CI,
   1.1058, 1.7172; P = 0.0043), remarkable effect rate (RR = 1.3389; 95\%
   CI, 1.1829, 1.5154; P < 0.0001), invalid rate (RR = 0.2299; 95\% CI,
   0.1591, 0.3322; P < 0.0001), and rate of adverse effects (RR = 0.6177;
   95\% CI, 0.4288, 0.8899; P = 0.0097). The same conclusion was drawn from
   the subgroup analysis. Conclusion: Results suggest that TCM combined
   with Dienogest is superior to Dienogest or TCM alone and can be used as
   a complementary treatment for endometriosis. TCMs have potential to
   improve clinical efficacy and reduce the side effects of Dienogest. This

Title = {Walking School Bus Programs: Implementation Factors, Implementation
   Outcomes, and Student Outcomes, 2017-2018},
Journal = {PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {17},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Purpose and Objectives
   Walking school bus programs increase children's physical activity
   through active travel to school; however, research to inform large-scale
   implementation of such programs is limited. We investigated contextual
   factors, implementation outcomes, and student outcomes in existing
   walking school bus programs in the United States and internationally.
   Intervention Approach
   Walking school bus programs involve a group of children walking to
   school together with an adult leader. On the trip to school, these
   adults provide social support, address potential traffic and
   interpersonal safety, and serve as role models to the children while
   children increase their physical activity levels.
   Evaluation Methods
   We conducted surveys with existing walking school bus programs
   identified through internet searches, referrals, and relevant email
   listservs. Leaders from 184 programs that operated at least 1 trip per
   week completed the survey. We used regression analyses to compare
   differences in contextual factors by area income and location,
   associations between contextual factors and implementation outcomes, and
   associations between implementation outcomes and student outcomes.
   Results
   Walking school bus programs in low-income communities had more route
   leaders and engaged in more active travel to school-related activities
   of being sustained than those in higher income. Programs that had no
   external funding, multiple route leaders, and coordination by a school
   or district staff member (as opposed to a parent) had greater student
   participation than other programs. Providing more trips than other
   programs per week was associated with reduced tardiness, reduced
   bullying, and improved neighborhood walkability. The greatest barriers
   to implementation were recruiting and maintaining students and
   identifying and maintaining route leaders.
   Implications for Public Health
   Walking school bus programs can be implemented successfully in many
   contexts using various models. The involvement of several people in
   leadership roles is critical for sustainability. Evidence-based
   implementation strategies that overcome barriers can improve reach,
   implementation, and sustainability of walking school bus programs and
   can increase children's physical activity.},

Title = {Anonymous Split E-Cash Toward Mobile Anonymous Payments},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {14},
Number = {4, SI},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Anonymous E-Cash was first introduced in 1982 as a digital,
   privacy-preserving alternative to physical cash. A lot of research has
   since then been devoted to extend and improve its properties, leading to
   the appearance of multiple schemes. Despite this progress, the practical
   feasibility of E-Cash systems is still today an open question. Payment
   tokens are typically portable hardware devices in smart card form,
   resource constrained due to their size, and therefore not suited to
   support largely complex protocols such as E-Cash. Migrating to more
   powerful mobile platforms, for instance, smartphones, seems a natural
   alternative. However, this implies moving computations from trusted and
   dedicated execution environments to generic multiapplication platforms,
   which may result in security vulnerabilities. In this work, we propose a
   new anonymous E-Cash system to overcome this limitation. Motivated by
   existing payment schemes based on MTM (Mobile Trusted Module)
   architectures, we consider at design time a model in which user payment
   tokens are composed of two modules: an untrusted but powerful execution
   platform (e.g., smartphone) and a trusted but constrained platform
   (e.g., secure element). We show how the protocol's computational
   complexity can be relaxed by a secure split of computations:
   nonsensitive operations are delegated to the powerful platform, while
   sensitive computations are kept in a secure environment. We provide a
   full construction of our proposed Anonymous Split E-Cash scheme and show
   that it fully complies with the main properties of an ideal E-Cash
   system. Finally, we test its performance by implementing it on an
   Android smartphone equipped with a Java-Card-compatible secure element.},

Title = {Ventral Hernia Management Expert Consensus Guided by Systematic
   Review},
Journal = {ANNALS OF SURGERY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {265},
Number = {1},
Pages = {80-89},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Objective: To achieve consensus on the best practices in the management
   of ventral hernias (VH).
   Background: Management patterns for VH are heterogeneous, often with
   little supporting evidence or correlation with existing evidence.
   Methods: A systematic review identified the highest level of evidence
   available for each topic. A panel of expert hernia-surgeons was
   assembled. Email questionnaires, evidence review, panel discussion, and
   iterative voting was performed. Consensus was when all experts agreed on
   a management strategy.
   Results: Experts agreed that complications with VH repair (VHR) increase
   in obese patients (grade A), current smokers (grade A), and patients
   with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) >= 6.5\% (grade B). Elective VHR
   was not recommended for patients with BMI >= 50 kg/m(2) (grade C),
   current smokers (grade A), or patients with HbA1C >= 8.0\% (grade B).
   Patients with BMI = 30-50 kg/m(2) or HbA1C = 6.5-8.0\% require
   individualized interventions to reduce surgical risk (grade C, grade B).
   Nonoperative management was considered to have a low-risk of short-term
   morbidity (grade C). Mesh reinforcement was recommended for repair of
   hernias >= 2 cm (grade A). There were several areas where high-quality
   data were limited, and no consensus could be reached, including mesh
   type, component separation technique, and management of complex
   patients.
   Conclusions: Although there was consensus, supported by grade A-C
   evidence, on patient selection, the safety of short-term nonoperative
   management, and mesh reinforcement, among experts; there was limited
   evidence and broad variability in practice patterns in all other areas
   of practice. The lack of strong evidence and expert consensus on these
   topics has identified gaps in knowledge where there is need of further
   evidence.},

Title = {Impact of First-of-Its-Kind Patient-Facing Pharmacogenetics Tool on
   Dosing Decisions and Treatment Outcomes},
Journal = {CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \& THERAPEUTICS},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JUN 27},
Abstract = {Germline pharmacogenetics (PGx) is increasingly used to tailor
   medication selection/dosing. However, existing systems primarily
   communicate PGx results to providers, limiting direct patient
   engagement. To address this, we developed YourPGx Oncology, an
   innovative patient-facing portal that delivers multi-gene PGx results
   (CYP2D6, UGT1A1, DPYD) through 33 unique, patient-friendly summaries.
   The utility of this tool was prospectively evaluated in an oncology
   population, where these pharmacogenes impact high-stakes treatments.
   Patients enrolled in the PhOCus study (NCT04541381) participated in
   single-session evaluations of the tool in-person or via videoconference,
   with a pharmacist available for questions and administering pre- and
   post-surveys that assessed educational impact. Each patient viewed their
   own previously obtained PGx results. Of 190 eligible patients, 70
   responded to solicitations via email, phone, and in-person, of whom 51
   (73\%) completed an observed session and completed surveys. Patients
   spent a median of 13.4 minutes (range 8.1-21.0) navigating YourPGx
   Oncology. After portal interaction, patients' ability to identify
   individual efficacy and safety estimates for chemotherapies and pain
   medications significantly improved, with the proportion accurately
   recognizing PGx-informed drug efficacy likelihoods rising from 32\% to
   72\% (Odds Ratio {[}OR] = 5.8 for the shift from discordant to
   concordant efficacy knowledge, P < 0.001), and PGx-related toxicity
   recognition increasing from 31\% to 57\% (OR = 3.2, P = 0.01). Our
   findings show that a customized patient-facing PGx results portal
   enhances patient understanding of individual medication efficacy and
   toxicity likelihoods, highlighting the potential key role of
   direct-to-patient PGx tools to facilitate optimized treatment-informed
   care and promote genetically guided shared decision-making.},

Title = {Assessing Barriers to Implementation of Machine Learning and Artificial
   Intelligence-Based Tools in Critical Care: Web-Based Survey Study},
Journal = {JMIR PERIOPERATIVE MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {6},
Abstract = {Background: Although there is considerable interest in machine learning
   (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) in critical care, the
   implementation of effective algorithms into practice has been limited.
   Objective: We sought to understand physician perspectives of a novel
   intubation prediction tool. Further, we sought to understand health care
   provider and nonprovider perspectives on the use of ML in health care.
   We aim to use the data gathered to elucidate implementation barriers and
   determinants of this intubation prediction tool, as well as ML/AI-based
   algorithms in critical care and health care in general. Methods: We
   developed 2 anonymous surveys in Qualtrics, 1 single-center survey
   distributed to 99 critical care physicians via email, and 1 social media
   survey distributed via Facebook and Twitter with branching logic to
   tailor questions for providers and nonproviders. The surveys included a
   mixture of categorical, Likert scale, and free-text items. Likert scale
   means with SD were reported from 1 to 5. We used student t tests to
   examine the differences between groups. In addition, Likert scale
   responses were converted into 3 categories, and percentage values were
   reported in order to demonstrate the distribution of responses.
   Qualitative free-text responses were reviewed by a member of the study
   team to determine validity, and content analysis was performed to
   determine common themes in responses. Results: Out of 99 critical care
   physicians, 47 (48\%) completed the single-center survey. Perceived
   knowledge of ML was low with a mean Likert score of 2.4 out of 5 (SD
   0.96), with 7.5\% of respondents rating their knowledge as a 4 or 5. The
   willingness to use the ML-based algorithm was 3.32 out of 5 (SD 0.95),
   with 75\% of respondents answering 3 out of 5. The social media survey
   had 770 total responses with 605 (79\%) providers and 165 (21\%)
   nonproviders. We found no difference in providers' perceived knowledge
   based on level of experience in either survey. We found that
   nonproviders had significantly less perceived knowledge of ML (mean 3.04
   out of 5, SD 1.53 vs mean 3.43, SD 0.941; P<.001) and comfort with ML
   (mean 3.28 out of 5, SD 1.02 vs mean 3.53, SD 0.935; P=.004) than
   providers. Free-text responses revealed multiple shared concerns,
   including accuracy/reliability, data bias, patient safety, and
   privacy/security risks. Conclusions: These data suggest that providers
   and nonproviders have positive perceptions of ML-based tools, and that a
   tool to predict the need for intubation would be of interest to critical
   care providers. There were many shared concerns about ML/AI in health
   care elucidated by the surveys. These results provide a baseline
   evaluation of implementation barriers and determinants of ML/AI-based
   tools that will be important in their optimal implementation and
   adoption in the critical care setting and healthcare in general.},

Abstract = {Biomedical research often involves studying patient data that contain
   personal information. Inappropriate use of these data might lead to
   leakage of sensitive information, which can put patient privacy at risk.
   The problem of preserving patient privacy has received increasing
   attentions in the era of big data. Many privacy methods have been
   developed to protect against various attack models. This paper reviews
   relevant topics in the context of biomedical research. We discuss
   privacy preserving technologies related to (1) record linkage, (2)
   synthetic data generation, and (3) genomic data privacy. We also discuss
   the ethical implications of big data privacy in biomedicine and present
   challenges in future research directions for improving data privacy in

Title = {Adaptation of the brainwriting premortem technique to inform the
   co-creation of COVID-19 testing strategies in underserved communities in
   South San Diego},
Journal = {BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH},

Abstract = {IntroductionMeaningful engagement of partners in co-creating and
   refining health-related programs can increase the initial uptake,
   sustained implementation, broad reach, and effectiveness of these
   programs. This is especially important for underserved communities where
   resources are limited and need to be prioritized. Brainwriting premortem
   is a novel qualitative approach to partner engagement that combines the
   strengths of individual idea generation with the concept of premortem
   exercise that addresses failure points prior to the implementation of
   new programs.MethodsAn adapted form of brainwriting premortem was used
   to inform iterative refinements to a COVID-19 testing program at a
   Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) in San Diego. Patients and
   providers from the FQHC participated in interviews at two time points
   (early- and mid-implementation of the program). Interview data were
   transcribed, translated, and analyzed using a rapid qualitative
   approach. Key themes and sub-themes were identified and used to inform
   refinements to the program.ResultsA total of 11 patients (7 Spanish- and
   4 English-speaking) and 8 providers participated in the brainwriting
   premortem interviews. Key themes related to possible reasons for
   COVID-19 testing program failure: advertising/sharing information;
   access to testing; handling of test results; staff and patient safety;
   patient beliefs and views regarding the SARS-CoV-2 virus; and COVID-19
   testing options offered. Proposed solutions were offered for the key
   failures except for patient beliefs and views regarding the SARS-CoV-2
   virus. Additional solutions offered were related to education, physical
   operations, and recruitment strategies. Real-time changes to the program
   flow and components were made in response to 7 suggestions from patients
   and 11 from providers. Changes related to the process of returning
   results were the most common, and included sending results via email
   with distinct workflows based on the test result.ConclusionThe
   implementation of the adapted brainwriting premortem technique allowed
   us to incorporate the perspective of key partners in the delivery and
   iterative refinement of the COVID-19 testing program. This was an
   effective tool in the context of an FQHC and can be a promising and
   approach to incorporate iterative input from patients and providers to
   ensure successful program implementation. Future studies, particularly
   those requiring rapid response to public health emergencies, should
   consider the use of this technique.},

Abstract = {Tor is a well-known low-latency anonymous communication system that is
   able to bypass Internet censorship. However, publicly announced Tor
   routers are being blocked by various parties. To counter the censorship
   blocking, Tor introduced non-public bridges as the first-hop relay into
   its core network. In this paper, we analyzed the effectiveness of two
   categories of bridge-discovery approaches: (i) enumerating bridges from
   bridge https and email servers, and (ii) inferring bridges by malicious
   Tor middle routers. Large-scale experiments were conducted and validated
   our theoretic findings. We discovered 2365 Tor bridges through the two
   enumeration approaches and 2369 bridges by only one Tor middle router in
   14 days. Our study shows that the bridge discovery based on malicious
   middle routers is simple, efficient and effective to discover bridges
   with little overhead. We also discussed the mechanisms to counter the
   malicious bridge discovery.},

   and identified factors that predict young, predominantly university
   student drivers' intentions to engage in initiating, monitoring/reading,
   and responding to social interactive technology (e.g., Facebook, email)
   on a smartphone. Participants (N = 114) were aged 17-25 years. The
   standard TPB constructs of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived
   behavioural control were assessed in an online survey, as well as the
   additional predictors of anticipated regret, moral norm, mobile phone
   involvement, and cognitive capture. The results of hierarchical multiple
   regression analyses showed the standard constructs accounted for 67\%,
   56\%, and 65\% of variance in intentions to initiate, monitor/read, and
   respond, respectively, with the extended variables contributing
   additional variance. For initiating behaviour, for example, attitude,
   subjective norm, PBC, and cognitive capture all had significant,
   positive relationships with intention, while moral norm had a
   significant, negative relationship. For responding behaviour, attitude,
   subjective norm, PBC, and cognitive capture all had significant,
   positive relationships with intention, while anticipated action regret
   had a significant, negative relationship. These different combinations
   of significant predictors of intentions for each of the three behaviours
   (i.e., initiating, monitoring/reading, and responding) suggest that they
   may be distinct and require different public education message content
   to influence young drivers' behaviours. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Why militarized conservation may be counter-productive: illegal wildlife
   hunting as defiance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Pages = {175-192},
Abstract = {In response to the past decade's surge in the illegal hunting of
   rhinoceros for the global trade in their horn, conservation authorities
   in southern Africa have increased the securitization of protected area
   conservation. Political ecologists have warned that violent, militarized
   approaches are counter-productive, because they fail to address the root
   causes of ``poaching{''} and may provide the moral justification for
   those already marginalized by conservation to hunt wildlife illegally.
   This is a powerful set of critiques, but scholars have yet to provide an
   empirically derived explanation of how and why militarized conservation
   might contribute to, rather than prevent, environmental harms. This lack
   of explanation emerges from a concerning scarcity of scholarly attention
   to the people who are actually living with militarized conservation. In
   response to the increased monitoring and arrests that accompanied the
   securitization of Mozambique's Limpopo National Park (LNP), Park
   residents expressed fear, anger, and resentment. Yet they continued to
   engage in the illegal subsistence-based practices of fishing and hunting
   in the face of mounting enforcements against these practices. In
   interviews and public demonstrations, residents consistently questioned
   the legitimacy of rangers' actions and authority, neutralizing the
   problem of their own potential involvement in illegal activities by
   focusing instead on the unjust and morally questionable behaviors of
   rangers. According to defiance theory, environmental harms will increase
   as the legitimacy of conservation policies, tactics, and authority
   decline. As defiance figures into and informs residents' decisions to
   continue to engage in subsistence-based practices, it may also motivate
   and justify people's involvement in the more lucrative and harmful
   activity of hunting threatened and endangered wildlife for the global
   trade. This article demonstrates why there is a need to fundamentally
   rethink the increased securitization of protected area conservation and
   addresses the need for improved understandings of human agency in the
   face of militarized conservation.},

Title = {Recruitment of trial participants through electronic medical record

Abstract = {Background/aim: Cost-efficient methods are essential for successful
   participant recruitment in clinical trials. Patient portal messages are
   an emerging means of recruiting potentially eligible patients into
   trials. We assessed the response rate and complaint rate from
   direct-to-patient, targeted recruitment through patient portals of an
   electronic medical record for a clinical trial, and compared response
   rates by differences in message content. Methods: The Study to
   Understand Fall Reduction and Vitamin D in You (STURDY) trial is a
   National Institutes of Health-sponsored, community-based study of
   vitamin D supplementation for fall prevention in older adults conducted
   at Johns Hopkins. Potential participants were identified using the Epic
   electronic medical record at the Johns Hopkins Health System based on
   age (>= 70 years), ZIP code (30-mile radius of study site), and prior
   activation of a patient portal account. We prepared a shorter message
   and a longer message. Both had basic information about study
   participation, but the longer message also contained information about
   the significance of the study and a personal invitation from the STURDY
   principal investigator. The Hopkins Institutional Review Board did not
   require prior consent from the patient or their providers. We calculated
   the response rate and tracked the number of complaints and requests for
   removal from future messages. We also determined response rate according
   to message content. Results: Of the 5.5 million individuals receiving
   care at the Johns Hopkins Health System, a sample of 6896 met our
   inclusion criteria and were sent one patient portal recruitment message
   between 6 April 2017 and 3 August 2017. Assessment of enrollment by this
   method ended on 1 December 2017. There were 116 patients who expressed
   interest in the study (response rate: 1.7\%). Twelve (0.2\%) recipients
   were randomized. There were two complaints (0.03\%) and one request to
   unsubscribe from future recruitment messages (0.01\%). Response rate was
   higher with the longer message than the shorter message (2.1\% vs 1.2\%;
   p = 0.005). Conclusion: Patient portal messages inviting seniors to
   participate in a randomized controlled trial resulted in a response rate
   similar to commercial email marketing and resulted in very few
   complaints or opt-out requests. Furthermore, a longer message with more
   content enhanced response rate. Recruitment through patient portals
   might be an effective strategy to enroll trial participants.},

Title = {Mobile Tablet Use among Academic Physicians and Trainees},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {37},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The rapid adoption rate and integration of mobile technology (tablet
   computing devices and smartphones) by physicians is reshaping the
   current clinical landscape. These devices have sparked an evolution in a
   variety of arenas, including educational media dissemination, remote
   patient data access and point of care applications. Quantifying usage
   patterns of clinical applications of mobile technology is of interest to
   understand how these technologies are shaping current clinical care. A
   digital survey examining mobile tablet and associated application usage
   was administered via email to all ACGME training programs. Data
   regarding respondent specialty, level of training, and habits of tablet
   usage were collected and analyzed. 40 \% of respondents used a tablet,
   of which the iPad was the most popular. Nearly half of the tablet owners
   reported using the tablet in clinical settings; the most commonly used
   application types were point of care and electronic medical record
   access. Increased level of training was associated with decreased
   support for mobile computing improving physician capabilities and
   patient interactions. There was strong and consistent desire for
   institutional support of mobile computing and integration of mobile
   computing technology into medical education. While many physicians are
   currently purchasing mobile devices, often without institutional
   support, successful integration of these devices into the clinical
   setting is still developing. Potential reasons behind the low adoption
   rate may include interference of technology in doctor-patient
   interactions or the lack of appropriate applications available for
   download. However, the results convincingly demonstrate that physicians
   recognize a potential utility in mobile computing, indicated by their
   desire for institutional support and integration of mobile technology
   into medical education. It is likely that the use of tablet computers in
   clinical practice will expand in the future. Thus, we believe medical
   institutions, providers, educators, and developers should collaborate in
   ways that enhance the efficacy, reliability, and safety of integrating
   these devices into daily medical practice.},

Abstract = {Backround: Emergency medical services (EMS) workers are at risk of
   exposure to bloodborne pathogens and frequently exposed to blood and
   bodily fluids through percutaneous injuries. This study aimed to assess
   the consistency with which standard precautions (SPs) among rural and
   urban EMS providers were used. Methods: This study consisted of a
   cross-sectional survey conducted with a sample of certified EMS
   providers in West Virginia in which we ascertained details about
   sociodemographic characteristics, and the frequency of consistent SP. An
   email invitation was sent to a comprehensive list of agencies obtained
   from the Office of West Virginia EMS. Findings: A total of 248 out of
   522 (47\%) EMS providers completed the survey. The majority of the EMS
   providers (76\%) consistently complied with SPs; however, more than one
   third (38\%) of urban EMS providers indicated inconsistent use compared
   with 19\% of rural EMS providers (p = .002). Most EMS providers reported
   low prevention practices to exposure of blood and body fluids in both
   areas. Conclusion/Application to Practice: The results emphasize the
   need to enhanced safe work practices among EMS providers in both rural
   and urban areas through education and increasing self-awareness.
   Occupational health professional in municipalities that serve these
   workers are instrumental in ensuring these workers are trained and
   evaluated for their compliance with SPs while in the field.},

Abstract = {Background: Hand eczema refers to eczema located on the hands,
   regardless of its etiology or morphology. Despite its high prevalence
   and significant impact on patients' quality of life, treatment is
   frequently challenging because of its heterogeneity, chronic and
   recurrent course, and lack of well-organized randomized controlled
   trials of the various treatment options. Objective: These consensus
   guidelines aim to provide evidence-based recommendations on the
   diagnosis and management of hand eczema to improve patient care by
   helping physicians make more efficient and transparent decisions.
   Methods: A modified Delphi method, comprising two rounds of email
   questionnaires with face-to-face meetings in between, was adopted for
   the consensus process that took place between February and September
   2020. Forty experts in the field of skin allergy and contact dermatitis
   were invited to participate in the expert panel. Results: Consensus was
   reached for the domains of classification, diagnostic evaluation, and
   treatment; and a therapeutic ladder to manage chronic hand eczema was
   developed. Conclusion: These are the first consensus guidelines for
   chronic hand eczema in the Asian population, which will help standardize
   care and assist clinical decision-making in the diagnosis and treatment
   of chronic hand eczema.},

Title = {Adapting an early autism caregiver coaching intervention for telehealth
   delivery in low-resource settings: A South African study of the `what'
   and the `why'},
Journal = {AUTISM},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic required in-person interventions to be adapted for
   remote delivery all over the globe. In South Africa, an in-person
   cascaded task-sharing naturalistic developmental behavioural
   intervention was adapted for telehealth delivery in a low-resource
   context. Here we describe the adaptations made (the `what') and reasons
   for adaptations (the `why'). The Framework for Modification and
   Adaptations (FRAME) was used to document the `what', and the
   Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework
   to describe the `why'. Systematic member-checking ensured robustness of
   results. The `what' included 10 adaptations: selecting WhatsApp as
   delivery platform, developing images with simple text to communicate
   intervention concepts, modifying session structure for hybrid delivery,
   including a caregiver self-reflection checklist, utilizing online
   practitioner training, supervision, assessment and consent procedures,
   developing session recording procedures, distributing session materials
   electronically, and developing caregiver-child interaction recording and
   uploading protocols. The `why' included three outer contextual factors
   (the digital divide, WhatsApp security/privacy policy, and COVID-19
   restrictions), three inner contextual factors (characteristics of
   caregivers and practitioners, ethics board guidance, and school
   leadership and organizational characteristics) and one innovation factor
   (support from intervention co-developers). Adaptations were made in
   response to unchangeable outer contextual factors and through
   identification of malleable inner contextual factors.Lay abstract We
   were busy with an early autism caregiver-coaching programme in South
   Africa, when COVID-19 stopped all in-person work. We changed the
   programme so it could be done using computers and/or phones. Here, we
   describe programme changes (which we call the `what') and the reasons
   for those changes (which we call the `why'). We used a tool called the
   Framework for Modification and Adaptations (FRAME) to describe the
   `what', and the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment
   (EPIS) framework to describe the `why' of our programme changes. The
   team members who helped make these changes checked that the changes
   described were correct. We made 10 changes in total: we used WhatsApp to
   deliver the programme, made simple pictures with words as visual tools
   for the programme, changed some session activities, changed a
   self-reflection checklist, provided all activities online, changed the
   way assessment and consent was done, made a session recording guide,
   sent things needed for sessions by email and WhatsApp, and made a
   caregiver-child play recording guide. The reasons for changes (the
   `why') were about factors outside schools (the types of phones and data
   people had, WhatsApp security rules, COVID-19 rules), things inside
   schools/workplace (about the caregivers and nonspecialists themselves,
   ethics boards, things about the school itself), and support from people
   who developed the programme. Changes were made by working with things
   inside schools/workplace that could change. Identifying what could
   change helped focus and guide which changes were made to a programme.},

Title = {A pilot study of an Internet walking program and pedometer in COPD},
Journal = {RESPIRATORY MEDICINE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {106},

Pages = {1342-1350},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Higher levels of physical activity are associated with
   better functional status, fewer hospital admissions, and lower
   mortality. In this pilot study, we examined the feasibility and safety
   of a novel program that combines a pedometer with a website to increase
   walking.
   Methods: 27 persons with stable COPD wore the Omron HJ-720ITC pedometer
   and used the website for 90 days. They uploaded step-count data to the
   study server using their home computer and received an email each week
   with their individualized step-count goal. The website provided
   step-count feedback, education, and motivational content. Subjects
   participated in a monthly semi-structured interview by telephone.
   Subjects reported changes in medical condition by telephone or on the
   website. Paired T-tests assessed change in daily step counts.
   Results: Subjects were males, mean age 72 +/- 8 years, with moderate
   COPD, FEV1, 1.57 +/- 0.48 L (55 +/- 16\% predicted). 87\% and 65\%
   reported no problems using the pedometer and website, respectively. At
   month 3, 96\% reported it was true that they knew their step count goal
   every day, and 52\% reported that they were able to reach their goal.
   95\% of participants said they would recommend the walking program to
   another person with COPD. Eight subjects experienced breathing problems
   unrelated to the intervention. In 24 subjects with step counts at
   baseline and month 3, there was a significant increase of 1263 steps per
   day (approximately 1.0 km), p = 0.0054.
   Conclusions: The use of a website and pedometer was feasible and safe,
   and persons increased their daily walking.

Title = {The role of striking and struck vehicles in side crashes between
   vehicles: Bayesian bivariate probit analysis in China},
Journal = {ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {134},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Objective: Side crashes between vehicles which usually lead to high
   casualties and property loss, rank first among total crashes in China.
   This paper aims to identify the factors associated with injury severity
   of side crashes at intersections and to provide suggestions for
   developing countermeasures to mitigate the levels of injuries.
   Method: In order to investigate the role of striking and struck vehicles
   in side crashes simultaneously, bivariate probit model was proposed and
   Bayesian approach was employed to evaluate the model, compared to the
   corresponding univariate probit model.
   Data: Crash data from Beijing, China for the period 2009-2012 were used
   to carry out the statistical analysis. Based on the investigation with
   vehicles and data analysis on events, 130 intersection side crash cases
   were selected to form a specific dataset. Then, the influence of human,
   vehicles, roadway and environmental variables on crash severity was
   examined by means of bivariate probit regression within Bayesian
   framework.
   Results: The effects of the factors on striking vehicle drivers and
   struck vehicle drivers were considered separately and simultaneously to
   find more targeted conclusions. The statistical analysis revealed
   vehicle type, lane number, no non-motorized lane and speeding have the
   corresponding influence on the injury severity of striking vehicles,
   while time of day and vehicle type of struck vehicles increased the
   likelihood of being injured.
   Conclusions: From the results it can be concluded that there indeed
   exists correlation between striking and struck vehicles in side crashes,
   although the correlation is not so strong. Importantly, Bayesian
   bivariate probit model can address the role of striking and struck
   vehicles in side crashes simultaneously and can accommodate the
   correlation clearly, which extends the range of univariate probit
   analysis. The general and empirical countermeasures are presented to
   improve the safety at intersections.},

Journal = {INJURY EPIDEMIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},

Month = {JUL 21},
Abstract = {Background Temporary, voluntary storage of firearms away from the home
   during times of risk is a recommended strategy for suicide prevention.
   Law enforcement agencies (LEAs) are often suggested as storage sites,
   and online maps in Colorado and Washington display LEAs willing to
   consider storage. Questions remain about the experiences and views of
   LEAs, including barriers to providing storage. Methods LEAs in Colorado
   and Washington were invited to complete a survey via mail or online from
   June to July 2021; invitations were sent by email and mail, with
   telephone calls to non-responders. Survey data were analyzed using
   descriptive statistics, with testing between states and other subgroups
   using Fisher's exact tests. Results Overall, 168 LEAs in Colorado (n =
   91) or Washington (n = 77) participated (40\% participation rate). Of
   those, 53\% provided temporary, voluntary storage upon request by
   community members at the time of the survey. More LEAs said they had
   ever provided storage when the requester was under a court order (74\%
   overall). Over half (60\%) of responding LEAs had received at least one
   storage request in the prior 12 months. Many (41\%) said they had
   declined to return a firearm after temporary storage due to safety
   concerns. Most LEAs supported engagement in suicide prevention (89\%)
   and provision of community services (77\%), but they simultaneously
   preferred being a storage option of last resort (73\%). Factors
   negatively influencing storage provision included liability and funding
   concerns. Conclusions In Colorado and Washington, half of LEAs currently
   offer temporary, voluntary firearm storage upon request. While LEAs
   support suicide prevention and community engagement, broader provision
   of storage and participation in online maps may be limited by logistic,
   liability, and financial concerns. Addressing these barriers may
   facilitate broader suicide prevention efforts.},

Title = {\&quot;We are still tired\&quot;: staff and administrators' experiences
   during the COVID-19 pandemic within California residential care
   facilities for older adults},
Journal = {BMC GERIATRICS},

Abstract = {BackgroundExtensive research has been conducted on the impacts of the
   COVID-19 pandemic on long-term care workers in specialized care
   facilities. However, little is known about the impacts faced by
   facilities that provide generalized long-term support and care, such as
   residential care facilities for older adults (RCFs). This study
   describes the challenges experienced by staff and administrators of RCFs
   during the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsAn electronic questionnaire
   collecting data using both closed- and open-ended questions on staff
   experiences was sent to 5,721 unique RCF administrator emails within the
   state of California between June-December 2021. Email addresses were
   obtained from the public database of RCFs available through the
   California Health and Human Services Open Data Portal. Descriptive
   statistics were calculated on quantitative data regarding staff
   preparedness training, access to resources, and administrators'
   confidence in meeting recommended guidelines during the pandemic.
   Inductive thematic analysis was conducted on qualitative data regarding
   the confidence levels in meeting pandemic guidelines and challenges
   faced related to staff stress and morale.ResultsA total of 150 RCF
   administrators across California (response rate of 2.6\%) completed the
   survey. Over three-fourths of respondents indicated their facilities had
   a designated staff member to train other staff members on emergency
   preparedness plans and the most frequently used resources during the
   COVID-19 pandemic were the Department of Social Services Community Care
   Licensing Division (88.7\%), the county health department (86.7\%), and
   the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (80.7\%). Administrators
   felt least confident in their facilities' ability to maintain adequate
   staffing (52.0\%), communication with nearby hospitals (62.1\%) and
   communication with state and local public health officials (69.8\%)
   during the pandemic. Three central themes emerged from the thematic
   analysis on staff stress and morale: (1) physical safety, mental and
   emotional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) staffing issues; and (3)
   challenges with guidelines in managing the ongoing
   pandemic.ConclusionsFindings from this research study can be used to
   actively target training resources for facility administrators and staff
   that have been identified as most frequently used and relevant for
   emergency preparedness in these understudied facilities. Additionally,
   developing a better understanding of the staffing stress and morale
   difficulties in RCFs can provide insight on how policymakers can assist
   these critical facilities in better preparing for future crises.},

Abstract = {Background Transplant practices related to use of organs from hepatitis
   C virus-infected donors (DHCV+) is evolving rapidly. Methods We surveyed
   US kidney transplant programs by email and professional society LISTSERV
   postings between July 2019 and January 2020 to assess attitudes,
   management strategies, and barriers related to use of viremic (nucleic
   acid testing positive {[}NAT+]) donor organs in recipients who are not
   infected with HCV. Results Staff at 112 unique programs responded,
   representing 54\% of US adult kidney transplant programs and 69\% of
   adult deceased donor kidney transplant volume in 2019. Most survey
   respondents were transplant nephrologists (46\%) or surgeons (43\%).
   Among the responding programs, 67\% currently transplant DHCV
   antibody+/NAT- organs under a clinical protocol or as standard of care.
   By comparison, only 58\% offer DHCV NAT+ kidney transplant to recipients
   who are HCV-, including 35\% under clinical protocols, 14\% as standard
   of care, and 9\% under research protocols. After transplant of DHCV NAT+
   organs to recipients who are uninfected, 53\% start direct-acting
   antiviral agent (DAA) therapy after discharge and documented viremia.
   Viral monitoring protocols after DHCV NAT+ to HCV uninfected recipient
   kidney transplantation varied substantially. 56\% of programs performing
   these transplants report having an institutional plan to provide DAA
   treatment if declined by the recipient's insurance. Respondents felt a
   mean decrease in waiting time of \$18 months (range, 0-60) justifies the
   practice. Program concerns related to use of DHCV NAT+ kidneys include
   insurance coverage concerns (72\%), cost (60\%), and perceived risk of
   transmitting resistant infection (44\%). Conclusions Addressing
   knowledge about safety and logistic/financial barriers related to use of
   DHCV NAT+ kidney transplantation for recipients who are not infected
   with HCV may help reduce discards and expand the organ supply.},

Title = {THE FASTER HORSE FALLACY: HOW THE LAW IDEALIZES TECHNOLOGY},
Journal = {UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS LAW REVIEW},
Year = {2025},
Number = {2},
Pages = {609-680},
Abstract = {How does the legal profession understand new technology? Lawyers are
   involuntary experts in technology: we are not professionally trained in
   technology like engineers are but must know technology better than the
   typical citizen does, because the law must regulate how the typical
   citizen- that is, society-uses technology. The increasing complexity and
   variety of technologies that affect everyday life, such as artificial
   intelligence (AI), make our jobs as involuntary experts in technology
   all the more important. To prepare lawyers to regulate technology
   effectively, we must first examine how lawyers understand (or
   misunderstand) technology in the present. This Article examines a
   cognitive shortcut for understanding new technology that comes naturally
   to the legal profession but induces both practitioners and academics to
   misperceive technology and warps outcomes in both procedural and
   substantive law. This error, which I call the faster horse fallacy,
   refers to misunderstanding a new technology as identical to an old one,
   only cheaper and performing better. While cars and horses can both haul
   people or cargo, a car is not a faster equivalent of a horse because
   cars have features that horses lack, meaning that cars create problems
   that horses do not. The fallacy causes scholars to view AI-assisted
   discovery as a faster and cheaper version of human-centric review,
   thereby distorting litigation outcomes. The fallacy also causes courts
   to perceive email as a faster and cheaper equivalent of mail, which
   undermines the right to notice, and causes regulators to present
   electric vehicles as cleaner and cheaper equivalents of gasoline cars,
   which exposes motorists to new safety risks. The faster horse fallacy
   arises from a failure to separate a product from its underlying
   technology. Technology is rarely presented to the public solely as a
   technology; it is presented as a product that consumers want to use.
   Such products are designed so that users need no knowledge of the
   underlying technology to use a product. Consumers need not study
   internal combustion to drive a car because, if one needed an engineering
   degree to drive, Ford would go out of business. However, the ability to
   use a product creates an illusion that one also understands the
   technology an illusion that scholars appear to have encouraged. I submit
   that this illusion causes the law to idealize technology by
   overestimating what technology is capable of doing, thus entrusting
   technology with tasks that it cannot and therefore should not conduct on
   behalf of people and society.},

Title = {Evaluating complex interventions and health technologies using
   normalization process theory: development of a simplified approach and
   web-enabled toolkit},
Journal = {BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {11},
Month = {SEP 30},
Abstract = {Background: Normalization Process Theory (NPT) can be used to explain
   implementation processes in health care relating to new technologies and
   complex interventions. This paper describes the processes by which we
   developed a simplified version of NPT for use by clinicians, managers,
   and policy makers, and which could be embedded in a web-enabled toolkit
   and on-line users manual.
   Methods: Between 2006 and 2010 we undertook four tasks. (i) We presented
   NPT to potential and actual users in multiple workshops, seminars, and
   presentations. (ii) Using what we discovered from these meetings, we
   decided to create a simplified set of statements and explanations
   expressing core constructs of the theory (iii) We circulated these
   statements to a criterion sample of 60 researchers, clinicians and
   others, using SurveyMonkey to collect qualitative textual data about
   their criticisms of the statements. (iv) We then reconstructed the
   statements and explanations to meet users' criticisms, embedded them in
   a web-enabled toolkit, and beta tested this `in the wild'.
   Results: On-line data collection was effective: over a four week period
   50/60 participants responded using SurveyMonkey (40/60) or direct phone
   and email contact (10/60). An additional nine responses were received
   from people who had been sent the SurveyMonkey form by other
   respondents. Beta testing of the web enabled toolkit produced 13
   responses, from 327 visits to http://www.normalizationprocess.org.
   Qualitative analysis of both sets of responses showed a high level of
   support for the statements but also showed that some statements poorly
   expressed their underlying constructs or overlapped with others. These
   were rewritten to take account of users' criticisms and then embedded in
   a web-enabled toolkit. As a result we were able translate the core
   constructs into a simplified set of statements that could be utilized by
   non-experts.
   Conclusion: Normalization Process Theory has been developed through
   transparent procedures at each stage of its life. The theory has been
   shown to be sufficiently robust to merit formal testing. This project
   has provided a user friendly version of NPT that can be embedded in a
   web-enabled toolkit and used as a heuristic device to think through
   implementation and integration problems.},

Title = {Assessing the Impact of Patient-Facing Mobile Health Technology on
   Patient Outcomes: Retrospective Observational Cohort Study},
Journal = {JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 26},
Abstract = {Background: Despite the growth of and media hype about mobile health
   (mHealth), there is a paucity of literature supporting the effectiveness
   of widespread implementation of mHealth technologies.
   Objective: This study aimed to assess whether an innovative mHealth
   technology system with several overlapping purposes can impact (1)
   clinical outcomes (ie, readmission rates, revisit rates, and length of
   stay) and (2) patient-centered care outcomes (ie, patient engagement,
   patient experience, and patient satisfaction).
   Methods: We compared all patients (2059 patients) of participating
   orthopedic surgeons using mHealth technology with all patients of
   nonparticipating orthopedic surgeons (2554 patients). The analyses
   included Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous
   variables, and chi-square tests for categorical variables. Logistic
   regression models were performed on categorical outcomes and a
   gamma-distributed model for continuous variables. All models were
   adjusted for patient demographics and comorbidities.
   Results: The inpatient readmission rates for the nonparticipating group
   when compared with the participating group were higher and demonstrated
   higher odds ratios (ORs) for 30-day inpatient readmissions
   (nonparticipating group 106/2636, 4.02\% and participating group
   54/2048, 2.64\%; OR 1.48, 95\% CI 1.03 to 2.13; P=.04), 60-day inpatient
   readmissions (nonparticipating group 194/2636, 7.36\% and participating
   group 85/2048, 4.15\%; OR 1.79, 95\% CI 1.32 to 2.39; P<.001), and
   90-day inpatient readmissions (nonparticipating group 261/2636, 9.90\%
   and participating group 115/2048, 5.62\%; OR 1.81, 95\% CI 1.40 to 2.34;
   P<.001). The length of stay for the nonparticipating cohort was longer
   at 1.90 days, whereas the length of stay for the participating cohort
   was 1.50 days (mean 1.87, SD 2 vs mean 1.50, SD 1.37; P<.001). Patients
   treated by participating surgeons received and read text messages using
   mHealth 83\% of the time and read emails 84\% of the time. Patients
   responded to 60\% of the text messages and 53\% of the email surveys.
   Patients were least responsive to digital monitoring questions when the
   hospital asked them to do something, and they were most engaged with
   emails that did not require action, including informational content. A
   total of 96\% (558/580) of patients indicated high satisfaction with
   using mHealth technology to support their care. Only 0.40\% (75/2059)
   patients opted-out of the mHealth technology program after enrollment.
   Conclusions: A novel, multicomponent, pathway-driven, patient-facing
   mHealth technology can positively impact patient outcomes and
   patient-reported experiences. These technologies can empower patients to
   play a more active and meaningful role in improving their outcomes.
   There is a deep need, however, for a better understanding of the
   interactions between patients, technology, and health care providers.
   Future research is needed to (1) help identify, address, and improve
   technology usability and effectiveness; (2) understand patient and
   provider attributes that support adoption, uptake, and sustainability;
   and (3) understand the factors that contribute to barriers of technology
   adoption and how best to overcome them.},

Title = {eHealth Communication With Clients at Community-Based HIV/AIDS Service
   Organizations in the Southern United States: Cross-Sectional Survey},
Journal = {JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {4},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Providing HIV/STD testing and prevention education, medical
   and nonmedical case management, housing assistance, transportation
   services, and patient navigation are just a few examples of how
   community-based HIV/AIDS service organizations will help the United
   States realize the goals of the updated National HIV/AIDS Strategy.
   Objective: In this study, the aim was to assess electronic data security
   confidence level, electronic communication behaviors, and interest in
   using eHealth communication tools with clients of staff at
   community-based HIV/AIDS service organizations.
   Methods: Staff were recruited from 7 community-based HIV/AIDS service
   organizations in the southern United States (3 in South Carolina and 4
   in Texas). The principal investigator used state department of health
   websites to identify community-based HIV/AIDS service organizations.
   Staff were included if they provided HIV/STD prevention education to
   clients. A recruitment letter was sent to community-based HIV/AIDS
   service organization leaders who then used snowball sampling to recruit
   eligible staff. Chi-square tests were used.
   Results: Among staff (n=59) who participated in the study, 66\% (39/59)
   were very or completely confident that safeguards are in place to keep
   electronically shared information from being seen by other people; 68\%
   (40/59) used email, 58\% (34/59) used text messages, 25\% (15/59) used
   social media, 15\% (9/59) used a mobile app, 8\% (5/59) used web-enabled
   videoconferencing, and 3\% (2/59) used other tools (eg, electronic
   medical record, healthnavigator.com website) to communicate
   electronically with their clients. More than half were very interested
   in using eHealth communication tools in the future for sharing
   appointment reminders (67\%, 38/59) and general health tips (61\%,
   34/59) with their clients. Half were very interested in using eHealth
   communication tools in the future to share HIV medication reminders with
   their clients (50\%, 29/59). Forty percent (23/59) were very interested
   in using eHealth communication tools to share vaccination reminders with
   their clients.
   Conclusions: Community-based HIV/AIDS service organization staff had
   some level of confidence that safeguards were in place to keep
   electronically shared information from being seen by other people. This
   is critically important given the sensitivity of the information shared
   between community-based HIV/AIDS service organization staff and their
   clients, and because many staff were very interested in using eHealth
   communication tools with their clients in the future. It is very likely
   that eHealth communication tools can be used in community settings to
   improve health outcomes across the HIV care continuum; in the interim,
   more research is needed to better understand factors that may facilitate
   or impede community-based HIV/AIDS service organization staff use and
   client acceptability.},

   MyMobility Plan: Findings and lessons learned},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SAFETY RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Introduction: Age-related changes (e.g., cognitive, physiologic) can
   affect an individual's mobility and increase risks for falls and
   motor-vehicle crashes, which are leading causes of injuries and injury
   deaths among older Americans. To address this issue, CDC developed
   MyMobility Plan (MMP) products to help older adults make plans to reduce
   injury risks and promote safe mobility. In 2019, MMP products were
   disseminated to older adults and partner organizations. Dissemination
   strategies consisted of digital and print distribution and partner
   outreach. Methods: To assess dissemination efforts, a process (or
   implementation) evaluation was conducted from January to June 2019. Data
   were collected for 17 indicators (e.g., counts of webpage visits,
   product downloads, social media posts). Key informant interviews were
   conducted with partners, and qualitative analyses of interview data were
   undertaken to identify key themes related to their dissemination
   experiences. Results: Findings showed the dissemination resulted in
   13,425 product downloads and print copy orders and reached almost
   155,000 individuals through email subscriber lists, websites, webinars,
   and presentations. It is unknown what proportion of these individuals
   were older adults. Social media metrics were higher than expected, and
   58 partners promoted products within their networks. Partner interviews
   emphasized the need for guidance on dissemination, collaboration with
   local partners, and integration of the products within a program model
   to ensure broader reach to and use by older adults. Conclusions: The
   evaluation of the dissemination campaign identified strategies that were
   successful in creating exposure to the MMP and others that could improve
   reach in the future. Those strategies include meaningful and early
   partner engagement for dissemination. Practical applications: Building
   in evaluation from the start can facilitate development of appropriate
   data collection measures to assess project success. Engaging partners as
   active disseminators in the planning stages can help increase the reach
   of public health tools and resources.},

Abstract = {This is a survey of neural network applications in the real-world
   scenario. It provides a taxonomy of artificial neural networks (ANNs)
   and furnish the reader with knowledge of current and emerging trends in
   ANN applications research and area of focus for researchers.
   Additionally, the study presents ANN application challenges,
   contributions, compare performances and critiques methods. The study
   covers many applications of ANN techniques in various disciplines which
   include computing, science, engineering, medicine, environmental,
   agriculture, mining, technology, climate, business, arts, and
   nanotechnology, etc. The study assesses ANN contributions, compare
   performances and critiques methods. The study found that neural-network
   models such as feedforward and feedback propagation artificial neural
   networks are performing better in its application to human problems.
   Therefore, we proposed feedforward and feedback propagation ANN models
   for research focus based on data analysis factors like accuracy,
   processing speed, latency, fault tolerance, volume, scalability,
   convergence, and performance. Moreover, we recommend that instead of
   applying a single method, future research can focus on combining ANN
   models into one network-wide application.},

Abstract = {Since 2004 university students and faculty from the U.S. have worked
   face-to-face for a month each year with change agents in Zomba District,
   Malawi, on community-based participatory action research projects that
   address health, safety and education. This paper provides the
   challenges, strategies and accomplishments to date from this
   trans-global effort.
   Each year faculty and participants from previous years outline existing
   challenges as presented to them by Malawian educators and community
   members, for in-coming team members. Participants then connect through
   email, phone and postal mail with Malawians to plan together.
   Preparation includes co-planning with team members from previous years;
   regular communication with in-country partners; learning a local
   language; studying the Malawian culture, history, politics and education
   system; and preparing for project implementation. Many partners who do
   not actually travel with us to Malawi participate in substantive ways as
   pen pals for Malawian children, youth and teachers; and through
   networking for fund-raising and provision and preparation of materials
   and supplies.
   Approaches include participatory action research (McIntyre \& Lykes,
   2004) and indigenous research methods (Chilisa, 2012) that explore the
   contexts, values, customs, practices and beliefs (Hofstede et al., 2010)
   that undergird learning, teaching and leading. Data collection
   strategies include interviews and participant observation (Perakyla \&
   Ruusuvuori, 2011), ``power sensitive conversations{''} (Haraway, 1988),
   oral history (Gluck \& Patai, 1991), document and artifact analysis
   (Potter \& Wetherell, 1987), and case analysis including theoretical
   sampling (Flyvbjerg, 2011). Collaborators examine transcripts and
   analytic memos (Hammersley \& Atkinson, 2009). Final products are
   co-authored to ensure integrity of depictions.
   Challenges to Malawian children and youth are many. One adult in 5, one
   child in 10, tests positive for HIV/AIDS. The only current correlate of
   remaining disease-free is staying in school. However Standard 8 exams in
   English, and the cost of school fees, uniforms, shoes and school
   supplies, severe restrict access to secondary education. Malawi's
   universal public education initiative began only in 1994 and a shortage
   of schools and teachers prevails. Class size is over 100 learners who
   come to school speaking as many as 17 different local languages, while
   instruction is delivered in only one of these, with English taught as a
   second language in Standards 1-4, and all instruction and textbooks in
   English from Standard 5 forward. Hunger keeps children from attending
   school, and older girls may miss a week of school each month as they
   begin cycling. Teachers have little preparation or opportunities for
   inservice development. School writing materials are nearly non-existent,
   and textbooks, if available, must be shared across many learners or used
   by the teacher only in many cases. Yet through our collaborations over
   the last 10 years the Standard 8 exam passing rate has gone from 3 out
   of 65 to 67 out of 67, more youth are attending secondary, girls now
   attend regularly, and more teachers are attending college.
   The capacity for sustainable responses generated by U.S. based students
   and faculty working side by side with Malawian change agents is
   profound. Building from this work we are now assisting Malawians to
   represent what learning, teaching and leading mean in their cultural
   context 20 years after universal public education, and 40 years after
   independence. In this paper we examine outcomes to date, and directions
   for the future of our work together.},

   recreation patterns are but a few of the many challenges that currently,
   and for some time to come, the world has to cope with. To address these
   challenges and to mitigate some of them, ecosystem and particularly
   conservation management increasingly have to adopt strategies never
   considered before. One such new possibility is crowdsourcing, a variant
   of public consultation, where a number of experts are invited and, for
   example, asked to mark trees that - in their opinion - should be removed
   in order to improve or restore a forest ecosystem. This type of
   crowdsourcing has recently been carried out in many European countries
   and overseas as part of what commonly is referred to as marteloscope. In
   this paper, we addressed the question of how the rating or voting of
   such a crowd of experts is best aggregated to obtain one final,
   consolidated list of trees to be evicted. Standard approval voting often
   leads to a domination by the majority of voters and important
   contributions by minority experts are largely ignored. To avoid this and
   to better represent the pluralism of expertise and opinions in matters,
   where currently no best-practice guidelines exist, we analysed the
   effects of three proportional multiwinner rules used in political
   science by applying them to 50 marteloscope experiments in Great
   Britain. Our results indicated that proportional rules - particularly in
   situations where the invited expert markers disagree - achieved a better
   representation of different opinions than standard approval voting.
   Proportional rules also act as a safety mechanism reducing risks when
   the majority decisions prove inappropriate and as a consequence forest
   development could completely go astray.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the relationship between obesity and executive
   function, and between executive function and fall risk (as estimated
   from select gait parameters). Of the 39 young adults (age = 21.3 +/- 2.6
   years) recruited from the local university population via email
   announcement, 19 were in the obese group (based upon BMI and body fat
   percentage) and 20 were in the nonobese comparison group. Executive
   function was assessed using standardized tests including the Stroop test
   for selective attention; Trail Making test for divided attention,
   visuomotor tracking, and cognitive flexibility; the Verbal Fluency test
   for semantic memory; and the Digit-span test for working memory.
   Participants performed single-and dual-task walking (walking while
   talking) to evaluate fall risk during gait as measured by minimum toe
   clearance, required coefficient of friction, stance time, and
   stance-time variability. The obese group had lower scores for selective
   attention, semantic memory, and working memory. All participants had
   gait changes suggestive of a higher fall risk, for example, lower
   minimum toe clearance, longer stance time, and increased stance
   variability, during dual-task walking compared with single-task walking,
   and executive function scores (selective attention) were associated with
   gait (stance-time variability) during dual-task walking. Results
   indicate obesity was negatively associated with executive function among
   young adults and could increase fall risk.},

Title = {Recommendations for the conduct of systematic reviews in toxicology and
   environmental health research (COSTER)},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {143},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: There are several standards that offer explicit guidance on
   good practice in systematic reviews (SRs) for the medical sciences;
   however, no similarly comprehensive set of recommendations has been
   published for SRs that focus on human health risks posed by exposure to
   environmental challenges, chemical or otherwise.
   Objectives: To develop an expert, cross-sector consensus view on a key
   set of recommended practices for the planning and conduct of SRs in the
   environmental health sciences.
   Methods: A draft set of recommendations was derived from two existing
   standards for SRs in biomedicine and developed in a consensus process,
   which engaged international participation from government, industry,
   non-government organisations, and academia. The consensus process
   consisted of a workshop, follow-up webinars, email discussion and
   bilateral phone calls.
   Results: The Conduct of Systematic Reviews in Toxicology and
   Environmental Health Research (COSTER) recommendations cover 70 SR
   practices across eight performance domains. Detailed explanations for
   specific recommendations are made for those identified by the authors as
   either being novel to SR in general, specific to the environmental
   health SR context, or potentially controversial to environmental health
   SR stakeholders.
   Discussion: COSTER provides a set of recommendations that should
   facilitate the production of credible, high-value SRs of environmental
   health evidence, and advance discussion of a number of controversial
   aspects of conduct of EH SRs. Key recommendations include the management
   of conflicts of interest, handling of grey literature, and protocol
   registration and publication. A process for advancing from COSTER's
   recommendations to developing a formal standard for EH SRs is also
   indicated.},

Title = {Crowdsourced direct-to-consumer genomic analysis of a family quartet},
Journal = {BMC GENOMICS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {16},
Month = {NOV 7},
Abstract = {Background: We describe the pioneering experience of a Spanish family
   pursuing the goal of understanding their own personal genetic data to
   the fullest possible extent using Direct to Consumer (DTC) tests. With
   full informed consent from the Corpas family, all genotype, exome and
   metagenome data from members of this family, are publicly available
   under a public domain Creative Commons 0 (CC0) license waiver. All
   scientists or companies analysing these data ({''}the Corpasome{''})
   were invited to return results to the family.
   Methods: We released 5 genotypes, 4 exomes, 1 metagenome from the Corpas
   family via a blog and figshare under a public domain license, inviting
   scientists to join the crowdsourcing efforts to analyse the genomes in
   return for coauthorship or acknowldgement in derived papers. Resulting
   analysis data were compiled via social media and direct email.
   Results: Here we present the results of our investigations, combining
   the crowdsourced contributions and our own efforts. Four companies
   offering annotations for genomic variants were applied to four family
   exomes: BIOBASE, Ingenuity, Diploid, and GeneTalk. Starting from a
   common VCF file and after selecting for significant results from company
   reports, we find no overlap among described annotations. We additionally
   report on a gut microbiome analysis of a member of the Corpas family.
   Conclusions: This study presents an analysis of a diverse set of tools
   and methods offered by four DTC companies. The striking discordance of
   the results mirrors previous findings with respect to DTC analysis of
   SNP chip data, and highlights the difficulties of using DTC data for
   preventive medical care. To our knowledge, the data and analysis results
   from our crowdsourced study represent the most comprehensive exome and
   analysis for a family quartet using solely DTC data generation to date.},

   (2014-2016). The conversation draws on Cobb and Godden-Rasul's
   experience as feminist academics engaged in critical institutional
   practice through such initiatives as editing the Inherently Human blog,
   organising the Inspirational Women of Law exhibition, and participating
   in university working groups on campus-based harassment and violence. In
   asking Lishak to reflect on her journey to feminism and her experiences
   of activism, the conversation ranges over such issues as personal
   influences and experiences, strategies for securing institutional
   support, encouraging student engagement with feminism, and campaigning
   tactics. The conversation developed out of a ``Campus Feminisms{''}
   event in March 2016, which explored the rise of exciting new grassroots
   single-issue campaigns and political mobilisations by students in higher
   education, and was organised by Cobb and Godden-Rasul at Newcastle
   University, UK. Undergraduate and postgraduate students shared their
   personal struggles and achievements in bringing feminist ideas and
   campaigns to their university campuses. Lucy Morgan, the Gender Equality
   Officer at Newcastle University Students' Union, offered inspiring
   reflections on her efforts to reinvigorate the `F' word, in the face of
   simultaneous student apathy and backlash. Many of these campus-based
   mobilisations have demanded better institutional responses to sexual
   violence against women. At around the same time, Cobb was beginning a
   new role as the co-chair of the University of Manchester's first Task \&
   Finish Group on Sexual Violence and Harassment on Campus. This followed
   Universities UK's decision to create a taskforce to consider options for
   improving institutional responses to student safety. In the process,
   Cobb crossed paths with Lishak, who had been appointed a member of the
   UUK Taskforce in light of her path-breaking students' union work
   addressing violence against women. Since Lishak was an exemplar of this
   new feminist wave in higher education, one that was still inadequately
   understood by feminist academics despite often working side-by-side
   within the same institutions, the authors embarked on this conversation
   in order to better understand the relationship between academic and
   student feminist activism on campus. As Lishak makes clear in her own
   reflections, there is nothing inevitable about the synergies between
   these movements, but there is potentially a great deal that could be
   achieved through their closer engagement.},

Title = {``Bureaucrats with Badges{''}: Bylaw Enforcement and the
   Invisibilization of Homelessness},
Journal = {SOCIAL PROBLEMS},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JAN 21},
Abstract = {Homelessness affects at least 25,000 people every day in Canada alone.
   Although research has documented responses to homelessness involving the
   police and private security, there is much less scholarship
   investigating municipal bylaw enforcement officers' role in the
   governance of homelessness. We explore how bylaw officers regulate
   homelessness in Ontario, Canada. Drawing on surveys and semi-structured
   interviews with bylaw officers, our analysis demonstrates that bylaw
   officers have been called upon to manage a ``crisis of complaints{''}
   related to the increasing visibility of homelessness across Ontario. To
   manage these complaints, bylaw officers rely on burden shuffling, first,
   moving people along because it is the most efficient way to manage
   homelessness complaints in their jurisdiction. Bylaw officers also
   engage in bureaucratic burden shuffling, reclassifying complaints to
   other agencies. We argue that, through their mechanisms of enforcing
   public space orders, bylaw officers engage in reluctant criminalization
   using invisibilization tactics. These strategies constitute another form
   of pervasive penality, or a punitive process of policing, through move
   along orders and threats of arrest, ultimately leading to the
   invisibilization of homelessness. Such responses increase the precarity
   that often characterizes unhoused people's lives and misrepresents
   homelessness as a deviancy issue rather than a human rights violation.},

Title = {Complex Family Planning fellowship graduates' intended practice plans
   and barriers to practicing in areas of unmet need},
Journal = {CONTRACEPTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {123},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Objectives: To describe practice patterns and challenges encountered by
   Complex Family Planning (CFP) fellowship graduates.Study design: We
   invited all 110 obstetrics and gynecology physicians who graduated from
   the CFP fellowship from 2017-2020 via email to complete an anonymous
   online survey. We inquired about demographics, intended and obtained
   postfellowship positions, and successes and challenges in obtaining
   jobs. We used Fisher's exact test to assess if the proportion of
   graduates who grew up, attended residency, and completed fellowship in a
   US region (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West) and practiced in that
   same region differed.Results: Ninety-nine (90.0\%) graduates completed
   the survey. When entering fellowship, most (n = 92 {[}92.9\%]) expected
   to practice in an academic environment. About half (n = 49 {[}49.5\%])
   pursued fellowship with the intent to practice in a location with an
   unmet need for abortion providers, of which 22 (44.9\%) did so.
   Forty-nine (49.5\%) respondents did not practice after fellowship where
   they initially intended, citing common challenges of job availability,
   family-related concerns, safety concerns, and relationship status
   changes. We found associations between regions where graduates completed
   residency and currently practice (p = 0.004), driven primarily by higher
   associations in the South (76.9\%) and West (70.6\%) and a lower
   association in the Midwest (22.7\%). We found no association between
   current practice region and where graduates grew up (p = 0.15) or
   completed fellowship (p = 0.23).Conclusions: CFP fellowship graduates
   from 2017-2020 primarily intended to practice in academic environments
   with half planning to practice in underserved locations. However, more
   than half of those who entered fellowship hoping to fill an unmet need
   for abortion providers did not do so. Implications: About half of CFP
   fellowship graduates from 2017-2020 intended to obtain positions in
   areas they defined as having an unmet need for abortion provision.
   Personal life and job barriers prevented many from serving in such
   positions after fellowship. Practice location intentions and outcomes
   may be different in a post-Dobbs environment.},

Title = {International survey of COVID-19 management strategies},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR QUALITY IN HEALTH CARE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {33},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: While individual countries have gained considerable
   knowledge and experience in coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19)
   management, an international, comparative perspective is lacking,
   particularly regarding the measures taken by different countries to
   tackle the pandemic. This paper elicits the views of health system
   staff, tapping into their personal expertise on how the pandemic was
   initially handled.
   Methods: From May to July 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional, online,
   purpose-designed survey comprising 70 items. Email lists of contacts
   provided by the International Society for Quality in Health Care, the
   Italian Network for Safety in Health Care and the Australian Institute
   of Health Innovation were used to access healthcare professionals and
   managers across the world. We snowballed the survey to individuals and
   groups connected to these organizations. Key outcome measures were
   attitudes and information about institutional approaches taken; media
   communication; how acute hospitals were re-organized; primary health
   organization; personal protective equipment; and staffing and training.
   Results: A total of 1131 survey participants from 97 countries across
   the World Health Organization (WHO) regions responded to the survey.
   Responses were from all six WHO regions; 57.9\% were female and the
   majority had 10 or more years of experience in healthcare; almost half
   (46.5\%) were physicians; and all other major clinical professional
   groups participated. As the pandemic progressed, most countries
   established an emergency task force, developed communication channels to
   citizens, organized health services to cope and put in place appropriate
   measures (e.g. pathways for COVID-19 patients, and testing, screening
   and tracing procedures). Some countries did this better than others. We
   found several significant differences between the WHO regions in how
   they are tackling the pandemic. For instance, while overall most
   respondents (71.4\%) believed that there was an effective plan prior to
   the outbreak, this was only the case for 31.9\% of respondents from the
   Pan American Health Organization compared with 90.7\% of respondents
   from the South-East Asia Region (SEARO). Issues with swab testing (e.g.
   delay in communicating the swab outcome) were less frequently reported
   by respondents from SEARO and the Western Pacific Region compared with
   other regions.
   Conclusion: The world has progressed in its knowledge and sophistication
   in tackling the pandemic after early and often substantial obstacles
   were encountered. Most WHO regions have or are in the process of
   responding well, although some countries have not yet instituted
   widespread measures known to support mitigation, for example, effective
   swab testing and social control measures.},

Title = {The Use of Technology for Communicating With Clinicians or Seeking
   Health Information in a Multilingual Urban Cohort: Cross-Sectional
   Survey},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {22},

Month = {APR 6},
Abstract = {Background: Technology is being increasingly used to communicate health
   information, but there is limited knowledge on whether these strategies
   are effective for vulnerable populations, including non-English speaking
   or low-income individuals.
   Objective: This study assessed how language preferences (eg, English,
   Spanish, or Chinese), smartphone ownership, and the type of clinic for
   usual source of care (eg, no usual source of care, nonintegrated safety
   net, integrated safety net, private or community clinic, academic
   tertiary medical center, or integrated payer-provider) affect technology
   use for health-related communication.
   Methods: From May to September 2017, we administered a nonrandom,
   targeted survey to 1027 English-, Spanish-, and Chinese-speaking San
   Francisco residents and used weighted multivariable logistic regression
   analyses to assess predictors of five technology use outcomes. The three
   primary predictors of interest-language preference, smartphone
   ownership, and type of clinic for usual care-were adjusted for age,
   gender, race or ethnicity, limited English proficiency, educational
   attainment, health literacy, and health status. Three outcomes focused
   on use of email, SMS text message, or phone apps to communicate with
   clinicians. The two other outcomes were use of Web-based health videos
   or online health support groups.
   Results: Nearly one-third of participants watched Web-based health
   videos (367/1027, 35.74\%) or used emails to communicate with their
   clinician (318/1027, 30.96\%). In adjusted analyses, individuals without
   smartphones had significantly lower odds of texting their clinician
   (adjusted odds ratio {[}aOR] 0.27, 95\% CI 0.13-0.56), using online
   health support groups (aOR 0.14, 95\% CI 0.04-0.55), or watching
   Web-based health videos (aOR 0.31, 95\% CI 0.15-0.64). Relative to
   English-speaking survey respondents, individuals who preferred Chinese
   had lower odds of texting their clinician (aOR 0.25, 95\% CI 0.08-0.79),
   whereas Spanish-speaking survey respondents had lower odds of using apps
   to communicate with clinicians (aOR 0.34, 95\% CI 0.16-0.75) or joining
   an online support group (aOR 0.30, 95\% CI 0.10-0.92). Respondents who
   received care from a clinic affiliated with the integrated safety net,
   academic tertiary medical center, or integrated payer-provider systems
   had higher odds than individuals without a usual source of care at using
   emails, SMS text messages, or apps to communicate with clinicians.
   Conclusions: In vulnerable populations, smartphone ownership increases
   the use of many forms of technology for health purposes, but device
   ownership itself is not sufficient to increase the use of all
   technologies for communicating with clinicians.
   Language preference impacts the use of technology for health purposes
   even after considering English proficiency. Health system factors impact
   patients' use of technology-enabled approaches for communicating with
   clinicians. No single factor was associated with higher odds of using
   technology for all health purposes; therefore, existing disparities in
   the use of digital health tools among diverse and vulnerable populations
   can only be addressed using a multipronged approach.},

Title = {Introduction to the Coproduction of Supervision Standards for Digital
   Peer Support: Qualitative Study},
Journal = {JMIR HUMAN FACTORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Abstract = {Background: Digital peer support enhances engagement in mental and
   physical health services despite barriers such as location,
   transportation, and other accessibility constraints. Digital peer
   support involves live or automated peer support services delivered
   through technology media such as peer-to-peer networks, smartphone apps,
   and asynchronous and synchronous technologies. Supervision standards for
   digital peer support can determine important administrative, educative,
   and supportive guidelines for supervisors to maintain the practice of
   competent digital peer support, develop knowledgeable and skilled
   digital peer support specialists, clarify the role and responsibility of
   digital peer support specialists, and support specialists in both an
   emotional and developmental capacity. Objective: Although digital peer
   support has expanded recently, there are no formal digital supervision
   standards. The aim of this study is to inform the development of
   supervision standards for digital peer support and introduce guidelines
   that supervisors can use to support, guide, and develop competencies in
   digital peer support specialists. Methods: Peer support specialists that
   currently offer digital peer support services were recruited via an
   international email listserv of 1500 peer support specialists. Four
   1-hour focus groups, with a total of 59 participants, took place in
   October 2020. Researchers used Rapid and Rigorous Qualitative Data
   Analysis methods. Researchers presented data transcripts to focus group
   participants for feedback and to determine if the researcher's
   interpretation of the data match their intended meanings. Results: We
   identified 51 codes and 11 themes related to the development of
   supervision standards for digital peer support. Themes included (1)
   education on technology competency (43/197, 21.8\%), (2) education on
   privacy, security, and confidentiality in digital devices and platforms
   (33/197, 16.8\%), (3) education on peer support competencies and how
   they relate to digital peer support (25/197, 12.7\%), (4) administrative
   guidelines (21/197, 10.7\%), (5) education on the digital delivery of
   peer support (18/197, 9.1\%), (6) education on technology access
   (17/197, 8.6\%), (7) supervisor support of work-life balance (17/197,
   8.6\%), (8) emotional support (9/197, 4.6\%), (9) administrative
   documentation (6/197, 3\%), (10) education on suicide and crisis
   intervention (5/197, 2.5\%), and (11) feedback (3/197, 1.5\%).
   Conclusions: Currently, supervision standards from the Substance Abuse
   and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) for in-person peer
   support include administrative, educative, and supportive functions.
   However, digital peer support has necessitated supervision standard
   subthemes such as education on technology and privacy, support of
   work-life balance, and emotional support. Lack of digital supervision
   standards may lead to a breach in ethics and confidentiality, workforce
   stress, loss of productivity, loss of boundaries, and ineffectively
   serving users who participate in digital peer support services. Digital
   peer support specialists require specific knowledge and skills to
   communicate with service users and deliver peer support effectively,
   while supervisors require new knowledge and skills to effectively
   develop, support, and manage the digital peer support role.},

Abstract = {In an accurate and timely manner, capturing the risk signals for a
   specific emerging technology from academic publications is important to
   facilitate risk governance and to reduce the potential negative impact
   on socioeconomic systems. In the past decade, three-dimensional printing
   (3D printing) has become a promising emerging technology. To identify
   the relevant research on risk analysis for 3D printing, ``term
   clumping{''} on ``risk analysis{''} is explored using a quantitative
   method, and an integrated framework for risk identification is proposed
   with regard to 3D printing. This method involves a variation of TF{*}IDF
   and several new metrics for a Boolean query of the literature. The
   empirical results for the risk analysis studies of 3D printing show
   that, to date, very little attention has been paid to the relevant
   topics. However, although the risk signals of 3D printing are still weak
   and dispersed in many different categories, the potential threats to
   human health, cyber-security, and the environment are revealed in some
   facets. This enables initiation of strategies for anticipatory
   governance, involving science and technology policies and regulations.},

Title = {Design and Implementation of an Opioid Scorecard for Hospital
   System-Wide Peer Comparison of Opioid Prescribing Habits: Observational
   Study},
Journal = {JMIR HUMAN FACTORS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Abstract = {Background: Reductions in opioid prescribing by health care providers
   can lead to a decreased risk of opioid dependencein patients. Peer
   comparison has been demonstrated to impact providers' prescribing
   habits, though its effect on opioidprescribing has predominantly been
   studied in the emergency department setting. Objective: The purpose of
   this study is to describe the development of an enterprise-wide opioid
   scorecard, the architecture ofits implementation, and plans for future
   research on its effects. Methods: Using data generated by the author's
   enterprise vendor-based electronic health record, the enterprise
   analyticssoftware, and expertise from a dedicated group of
   informaticists, physicians, and analysts, the authors developed an
   opioidscorecard that was released on a quarterly basis via email to all
   opioid prescribers at our institution. These scorecards
   compareproviders' opioid prescribing habits on the basis of established
   metrics to those of their peers within their specialty throughoutthe
   enterprise. Results: At the time of this study's completion, 2034
   providers have received at least 1 scorecard over a 5-quarter
   periodending in September 2021. Poisson regression demonstrated a 1.6\%
   quarterly reduction in opioid prescribing, and chi-squareanalysis
   demonstrated pre-post reductions in the proportion of prescriptions
   longer than 5 days' duration and a morphineequivalent daily dose of >50.
   Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first peer comparison effort
   with high-quality evidence-based metrics of this scalepublished in the
   literature. By sharing this process for designing the metrics and the
   process of distribution, the authors hopeto influence other health
   systems to attempt to curb the opioid pandemic through peer comparison.
   Future research examiningthe effects of this intervention could
   demonstrate significant reductions in opioid prescribing, thus
   potentially reducing theprogression of individual patients to opioid use
   disorder and the associated increased risk of morbidity and mortality.},

Title = {Implications of the Diversity of the Rules on the Use of Force for
   Change in the Law},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL LAW},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {32},
Number = {2},
Pages = {679-697},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This article analyses the structural conditions within the jus ad bellum
   that affect whether and how that law changes. In particular, it examines
   how the diversity of the rules that form the law relating to the use of
   force affects the development of rules permitting the use of force to
   protect human rights. After noting some areas where it has been argued
   that aspects of the law relating to use of force have changed as a
   result of evolving state practice, it identifies a number of obstacles
   to accepting the argument that changes to customary international law
   can affect the law on the use of force in the UN Charter. It is argued
   that, unlike with self-defence, changes to customary international law
   would not automatically lead to changes in the Charter prohibition of
   the use of force. Since any rule permitting humanitarian intervention
   would create a new exception to the Charter prohibition of the use of
   force and to a norm of jus cogens, that change cannot occur on the basis
   of custom alone. Changes to interpretations of the UN Charter and to a
   jus cogens norm will be required, and such changes must occur in line
   with the rules regarding how such norms change. Finally, the article
   considers one concrete possibility for a change to the jus ad bellum
   that would allow humanitarian intervention without UN Security Council
   approval: approval of such a use of force by the UN General Assembly
   under the `Uniting for Peace' Resolution of 1950. Leaving aside the
   political and practical challenges of achieving such change, the section
   explores the conceptual challenges that would need to be overcome.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Accessibility to abundant sources of high-quality water is integral to
   the production of safe and wholesome fresh produce. However, access to
   safe water is becoming increasingly difficult in many parts of the
   world, and this can lead to the production of fresh produce contaminated
   with pathogenic microorganisms, resulting in increased risk of human
   disease. Water, an important raw material in the fresh produce chain, is
   used in considerable amounts in many operations, including irrigation
   and application of pesticides and fertilizers, but also as a transport
   medium and for cooling and washing in postharvest practices. In several
   reported outbreaks related to uncooked fruit and vegetable products,
   water has been identified as a likely source of the outbreak. The
   present study, initiated by the ILSI Europe Emerging Microbiological
   Issues Task Force in collaboration with 8 other ILSI branches and
   support of WHO/FAO, was undertaken to review the status of, and provide
   suggestions for, consideration by different stakeholders on water and
   sanitation and its impact on food safety and public health. A limited
   number of guidelines and regulations on water quality for agricultural
   production are available, and many of them are still heavily based on
   microbial standards and (debated) parameters such as fecal coliforms.
   Data gaps have been identified with regard to baseline studies of
   microbial pathogens in water sources in many regions, the need for
   agreement on methods and microbial parameters to be used in assessing
   water quality, the fate of pathogens in water, and their transfer and
   persistence on irrigated/processed produce.},

Abstract = {Using mobile devices for various flight planning tasks is becoming the
   norm among general aviation (GA) pilots. Mobile apps, such as ForeFlight
   and Garmin Pilot, provide services such as flight plan filing,
   electronic charts, and weather briefings, but time-consuming and
   error-prone voice-based methods must still be used to exchange clearance
   information with air traffic control (ATC). The ubiquity of mobile
   device and app use by pilots suggests that mobile applications could
   also be used to deliver Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) clearances and
   provide other traditionally voice-based services. This concept proposes
   that pilots will be able to exchange pre-departure and post-arrival
   information electronically at both towered and non-towered airports in
   the United States (U.S.), without speaking a single word. Similar to the
   Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) technology known as Data
   Communications (DataComm), used to supplement verbal communication with
   digitally delivered messages 111, mobile devices may provide an
   affordable option to GA pilots for pre-departure and post-arrival
   electronic information exchange. Both implementations provide a
   significant reduction in pilot and controller workload for the services
   they enable. Electronic information exchange may eliminate read-back
   errors and incorrect interpretations of spoken clearances for
   controllers across the country and the over 300,000 instrumentrated
   pilots in the U.S. (as of December 31, 2018) 121 to whom they deliver
   clearances.
   The concept consists of four parts: providing IFR clearance delivery,
   negotiating IFR release at non-towered airports, exchanging other
   pre-departure information, and cancelling IFR at non-towered airports.
   The MITRE Corporation (MITRE) created a research prototype, using flight
   plan information from the FAA's System Wide Information Management
   (SWIM) Flight Data Publication Service (SFDPS), to evaluate the
   concept's operational acceptability and investigate resulting benefits.
   It is expected that a fully electronic information exchange will
   significantly reduce pilot and controller workload. However, before the
   concept can be implemented as a capability available to users of the
   National Airspace System (NAS), some preliminary steps must be taken by
   the FAA, in conjunction with industry, to validate the concept to ensure
   success.
   In the summer of 2018, we partnered with ForeFlight, an electronic
   flight bag (EFB) technology provider, to design and conduct a 75-day
   field test of the mobile clearance delivery concept at Manassas Regional
   Airport (HEF). This study focused strictly on clearance delivery at a
   towered airport and was designed to be transparent to ATC. Participation
   in the test was available to pilots on a voluntary basis; pilots who
   opted into the study received an email from ForeFlight with expected
   clearance information. The goal was two-fold: 1) to show that it is
   possible for automation to generate accurate expected clearance
   information by comparing automatically generated clearances to the
   clearances provided verbally to pilots, and 2) to collect feedback from
   end users on the accuracy and acceptability of an electronic clearance
   delivery concept. Pilot subject matter experts listened to recordings
   for over 30 percent of the flights processed during the test period and
   compared the recorded clearances to the MITRE-generated data. The MITRE
   project team also reviewed subjective feedback from test participants.
   This field test successfully demonstrated that it is feasible to use
   SWIM data to formulate expected clearances and transmit that information
   to the pilot. Although we identified some mismatches between formulated
   clearance data and controller verbally issued clearances, analysis of
   the collected data allowed the team to determine the changes required to
   correct these mismatches and reliably send accurate clearance data to
   the pilot.
   Following the field test, we conducted table-top exercises to further
   explore the accuracy and effectiveness of delivering clearance
   information using a streamlined process that required minimal verbal
   exchange. We are also examining the end-to-end safety and cybersecurity
   implications of using mobile devices to exchange clearance information
   and will provide recommendations for developing a methodology to provide
   the assurance and security of data transmissions for mobile devices to
   enable these IFR services for GA pilots. Through these activities, we
   have identified challenges to making the mobile IFR services concept a
   reality. The most profound challenges are related to limitations within
   NAS systems, a mismatch between procedures and adaptation, and data
   elements that are unavailable to external systems. These technical
   challenges must be mitigated or overcome to enable these mobile IFR
   services.},

Title = {PrEP your step: Implementing an online crowdsourcing contest to engage
   young people in HIV prevention in Washington DC, USA},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {HIV incidence among young people (Black and Latinx women and men who
   have sex with men ages 16-24 years), in the United States is high.
   Traditional top-down approaches for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
   social marketing are not effectively reaching this population.
   Crowdsourcing is a promising approach to engaging young people in the
   development of innovative solutions to raise awareness and use of PrEP
   among those at highest risk of HIV. This study engaged young people in
   the design and evaluation of an online crowdsourcing contest to promote
   PrEP among Washington, DC youth. The contest used standard methods
   recommended by the World Health Organization and feedback from our
   community partners. Online recruitment using social media elicited
   online votes and survey responses. We analyzed cross-sectional surveys
   using descriptive statistics, and semi-structured interviews with
   contest participants using thematic coding to explore barriers and
   facilitators to contest engagement. Approximately 82\% of entries were
   from young people in DC. A convenience sample of 181 people voted on
   their favorite crowdsourced PrEP messages and shared their awareness and
   attitudes about PrEP. The contest website received 2,500 unique visitors
   and 4,600 page views. Themes from semi-structured interviews (n = 16)
   included the need for more community engagement in developing PrEP
   messaging and positive attitudes towards crowdsourcing. Survey data (n =
   887) showed that the crowdsourced messages were well-liked and resonated
   with the community. Most preferred to see PrEP messages in social media
   (23\%), email (17\%) and videos (14\%). Approximately 70\% of survey
   participants reported that after viewing the crowdsourced message they
   would talk to their sexual partner or medical provider (63\%) about
   PrEP, use PrEP (58\%), and learn more about PrEP (56\%). Crowdsourced
   messages solicit substantial online viewership. More implementation
   research is needed to understand the public health impact of integrating
   social media, crowdsourcing, and community engagement to develop PrEP
   promotional messages.},

Title = {Changes in Registered Nurse Employment Plans and Workplace Assessments},
Journal = {JAMA NETWORK OPEN},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {7},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 18},
Abstract = {Importance The US registered nurse (RN) workforce is in flux, with high
   rates of burnout, intention to leave, and vacancies. Rapid, repeated
   assessments of the nursing workforce can help hospital executives and
   policymakers enact effective recruitment and retention strategies.
   Objective To identify changes in practicing RNs' employment plans and
   workplace assessments between the 2022 and 2023 surveys. Design,
   Setting, and Participants This survey study compared data collected from
   the Michigan Nurses' Study at 2 time points: February 22 to March 1,
   2022, and May 17 to June 1, 2023. Practicing RNs with an active,
   unrestricted license in Michigan and a valid individual email address
   were included. Main Outcome and Measures The primary outcome was nurses'
   intention to leave their current position within 1 year. In the 2023
   survey, nurses who planned to leave were queried on their next career
   step and the primary reason for their planned departure. Workplace
   assessments included questions about abusive or violent workplace
   events, emotional exhaustion, job satisfaction, the practice
   environment's delivery of high-quality care, and the clinical setting's
   safety rating. Regression analysis was used to examine workplace
   assessments and personal factors associated with planned departures.
   Results This study obtained data on 9150 nurses (6495 females
   {[}71.0\%]) and 7059 nurses (5134 females {[}72.7\%]) responding to the
   2022 (response rate, 8.3\%) and 2023 (response rate, 7.4\%) surveys,
   respectively. In the 2023 survey, 32.0\% (2259) of nurses planned to
   leave their position, compared with 39.1\% (3576) in the 2022 survey. Of
   these nurses, 957 (41.8\%) planned to leave their current employer but
   remain in nursing, with workloads as the most frequently cited reason
   (29.4\% {[}672]). Compared with the 2022 cohort, nurses in the 2023
   sample reported less workplace abuse or violence (4591 {[}50.2\%] vs
   3063 {[}43.4\%]; P < .001), fewer understaffed shifts (4407 {[}48.2\%]
   vs 2898 {[}41.0\%]; P < .001), and less frequent use of mandatory
   overtime (1709 {[}18.7\%] vs 824 {[}11.7\%]; P < .001). Factors
   associated with increased likelihood for planned departures included
   workplace abuse or violence (odds ratio {[}OR], 1.39; 95\% CI,
   1.05-1.82) and higher emotional exhaustion scores (OR, 3.05; 95\% CI,
   2.38-3.91). Favorable practice environments (OR, 0.37; 95\% CI,
   0.22-0.62) and excellent clinical setting safety ratings (OR, 0.28; 95\%
   CI, 0.14-0.56) were associated with lower likelihood of planned
   departure. Conclusions and Relevance Results of this study showed that
   nurses reported improved workplace conditions in the 2023 vs the 2022
   survey; however, planned departure rates, abusive or violent events, and
   unsafe conditions remained high, and understaffing remained a primary
   concern for most nurses. Health system leaders and policymakers should
   prioritize initiatives that support nurse retention and reduce potential
   workforce instability.},

Journal = {INTERNET JOURNAL OF ALLIED HEALTH SCIENCES AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background: Burnout is linked to various adverse outcomes (i.e.,
   thoughts of dropout, depression, unprofessional behaviors) in healthcare
   students (i.e., nursing students, medical students). However, potential
   adverse outcomes associated with burnout in athletic training students,
   a subset of healthcare students, have yet to be identified.Objective: To
   adapt a previously tested theoretical model to explore relationships
   between student workload, burnout, and potential adverse outcomes in a
   sample of graduate athletic training students.Methods: An online survey
   assessing the variables of interest and study information was sent to
   program directors of graduate-level athletic training programs at their
   publicly accessible email addresses with a request to forward the
   opportunity to their students. This was a nationwide sample of graduate
   athletic training students with 320 graduate athletic training students
   completing the survey. Descriptive statistics and structural equation
   modeling was used in our analysis.Results: Structural equation modeling
   confirmed that our hypothesized model successfully described
   relationships between academic workload, burnout, and adverse outcomes
   in athletic training students. Specifically, academic workload predicted
   burnout, and burnout in turn predicted various adverse outcomes (i.e.,
   thoughts of dropout, depression, unprofessional behaviors) in athletic
   training students. Educators should be aware of the potential adverse
   outcomes identified in this sample of athletic training students that
   have also been reported in other healthcare students.Conclusions:
   Methods to combat symptoms of burnout to enhance student well-being and
   avoid potential adverse outcomes should be identified. Future research
   should use the adapted theoretical model discussed in this article
   within other healthcare students' samples to understand further the
   complex network of relationships between academic workload, burnout, and
   adverse outcomes in the educational environment.},

Title = {Communicating During COVID-19: The Effect of Transparent Masks for
   Speech Recognition in Noise},
Journal = {EAR AND HEARING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {42},
Number = {4},
Pages = {772-781},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the speech
   recognition in noise when using a transparent mask that allows greater
   visibility of the talker's face compared to an opaque mask in persons
   with normal and impaired hearing via an online format. Design: A
   repeated-measures design was used to evaluate the auditory-visual
   recognition of sentences recorded in background noise with transparent
   and opaque face masks, and without a mask (N = 154). In a smaller
   follow-up study (N = 29), the same files were presented via
   auditory-only presentation to determine if differences observed in the
   transparent and opaque mask conditions were attributable to additional
   visual cues or to acoustic differences between the recordings of the two
   mask types. Listeners completed the 40-minute online session on a
   computer, laptop, or tablet in a quiet room via their personal listening
   devices (earbuds or hearing assistive device). The adult volunteers who
   used English as their first language were recruited through social media
   links and email and categorized into three groups: normal hearing and
   confirmed or suspected hearing loss either with or without the use of
   assistive listening devices. Results: Auditory-visual recognition of
   sentences recorded with the transparent mask was significantly better (M
   = 68.9\%) than for sentences recorded with the opaque mask (M = 58.9\%)
   for all participants. There was a trend for those who used hearing
   assistive technology to score lower than the other two groups who had
   similar performance across all conditions regardless of the mask type.
   Subjective ratings of confidence and concentration followed the expected
   pattern based on objective scores. Results of the auditory-only
   presentation of the sentences to listeners with normal hearing suggested
   that the transparent mask benefits were not attributable to an acoustic
   advantage but rather to the addition of the visual cues of the talker's
   face available through the transparent mask. In fact, performance in the
   auditory-only presentation was significantly lower with the transparent
   mask (M = 40.7\%) compared to the opaque mask (M = 58.2\%). Conclusions:
   Use of transparent masks can significantly facilitate speech recognition
   in noise even for persons with normal hearing and thus may reduce
   stressful communication challenges experienced in medical, employment,
   and educational settings during the global pandemic. To mitigate the
   spread of COVID-19 and facilitate communication, safety-approved
   transparent masks are strongly encouraged over opaque masks.},

Title = {Barriers to healthcare and self-reported adverse outcomes for autistic
   adults: a cross-sectional study},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Objectives Autistic people experience poor physical and mental health
   along with reduced life expectancy compared with non-autistic people.
   Our aim was to identify self-reported barriers to primary care access by
   autistic adults compared with non-autistic adults and to link these
   barriers to self-reported adverse health consequences. Design Following
   consultation with the autistic community at an autistic conference,
   Autscape, we developed a self-report survey, which we administered
   online through social media platforms. Setting A 52-item, international,
   online survey. Participants 507 autistic adults and 157 non-autistic
   adults. Primary and secondary outcome measures Self-reported barriers to
   accessing healthcare and associated adverse health outcomes. Results
   Eighty per cent of autistic adults and 37\% of non-autistic respondents
   reported difficulty visiting a general practitioner (GP). The
   highest-rated barriers by autistic adults were deciding if symptoms
   warrant a GP visit (72\%), difficulty making appointments by telephone
   (62\%), not feeling understood (56\%), difficulty communicating with
   their doctor (53\%) and the waiting room environment (51\%). Autistic
   adults reported a preference for online or text-based appointment
   booking, facility to email in advance the reason for consultation, the
   first or last clinic appointment and a quiet place to wait.
   Self-reported adverse health outcomes experienced by autistic adults
   were associated with barriers to accessing healthcare. Adverse outcomes
   included untreated physical and mental health conditions, not attending
   specialist referral or screening programmes, requiring more extensive
   treatment or surgery due to late presentations and untreated potentially
   life-threatening conditions. There were no significant differences in
   difficulty attending, barriers experienced or adverse outcomes between
   formally diagnosed and self-identified autistic respondents. Conclusions
   Reduction of healthcare inequalities for autistic people requires that
   healthcare providers understand autistic perspectives, communication
   needs and sensory sensitivities. Adjustments for autism-specific needs
   are as necessary as ramps for wheelchair users.},

Title = {Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the Italian
   council for the optimization of antimicrobial use},
Journal = {WORLD JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY SURGERY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 8},
Abstract = {Intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are common surgical emergencies and
   are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in hospital settings,
   particularly if poorly managed. The cornerstones of effective IAIs
   management include early diagnosis, adequate source control, appropriate
   antimicrobial therapy, and early physiologic stabilization using
   intravenous fluids and vasopressor agents in critically ill patients.
   Adequate empiric antimicrobial therapy in patients with IAIs is of
   paramount importance because inappropriate antimicrobial therapy is
   associated with poor outcomes. Optimizing antimicrobial prescriptions
   improves treatment effectiveness, increases patients' safety, and
   minimizes the risk of opportunistic infections (such as Clostridioides
   difficile) and antimicrobial resistance selection. The growing emergence
   of multi-drug resistant organisms has caused an impending crisis with
   alarming implications, especially regarding Gram-negative bacteria. The
   Multidisciplinary and Intersociety Italian Council for the Optimization
   of Antimicrobial Use promoted a consensus conference on the
   antimicrobial management of IAIs, including emergency medicine
   specialists, radiologists, surgeons, intensivists, infectious disease
   specialists, clinical pharmacologists, hospital pharmacists,
   microbiologists and public health specialists. Relevant clinical
   questions were constructed by the Organizational Committee in order to
   investigate the topic. The expert panel produced recommendation
   statements based on the best scientific evidence from PubMed and EMBASE
   Library and experts' opinions. The statements were planned and graded
   according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and
   Evaluation (GRADE) hierarchy of evidence. On November 10, 2023, the
   experts met in Mestre (Italy) to debate the statements. After the
   approval of the statements, the expert panel met via email and virtual
   meetings to prepare and revise the definitive document. This document
   represents the executive summary of the consensus conference and
   comprises three sections. The first section focuses on the general
   principles of diagnosis and treatment of IAIs. The second section
   provides twenty-three evidence-based recommendations for the
   antimicrobial therapy of IAIs. The third section presents eight clinical
   diagnostic-therapeutic pathways for the most common IAIs. The document
   has been endorsed by the Italian Society of Surgery.},

Abstract = {Seafood production and trade have expanded dramatically over the last 40
   years and comprise one of the fastest growing, and most environmentally
   impactful, sub-sectors of the global food system. While richer nations
   have increased their seafood consumption and displaced their
   environmental load, the marine environmental impact of fishery
   production has largely shifted to the waters of less-affluent nations.
   To sustain fishing economies and seafood security, in an era of
   increasing marine ecological precarity constitutes a major challenge for
   development and human well-being in the 21st century. Blue growth
   perspectives emphasize the transformative power of growth-oriented
   development. Such perspectives conflict with critical political economic
   theories of environment and food systems; notably, the treadmill of
   production and world food system scholarship. Using annual data from the
   Global Footprint Network, World Bank, UN FAO, and International Monetary
   Fund, this study applies methods in cross-national, panel regression
   analysis in order to ultimately pose some important challenges to
   modernist blue growth perspectives. The analysis suggests that economic
   growth and incorporation into the world market economy have led to
   unsustainable and inequitable outcomes regarding the marine ecological
   impact of fisheries.},

Abstract = {Objective: In late 2014, a measles outbreak beginning in California
   received significant media attention. To better understand the impact of
   this outbreak, we conducted a survey to assess and compare among vaccine
   hesitant and non-hesitant new mothers how this outbreak affected vaccine
   knowledge, attitudes, vaccination plans, and media use.
   Methods: A cross-sectional email survey of English-speaking women with a
   child 41 year old using a convenience sample of women from nine
   obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) practices in Colorado assessed
   vaccine hesitancy, knowledge and attitudes about MMR vaccines and the
   outbreak, MMR vaccination plans before and after the outbreak, and use
   of and trust for media sources related to the outbreak.
   Results: The response rate was 50\% (351/701). Knowledge about the
   outbreak was high and vaccination attitudes were mostly favorable.
   Forty-eight percent of respondents thought MMR vaccine was more
   important after the outbreak. Online news (76\%), television news
   (75\%), and social media (68\%) were the most frequently used media
   sources, yet were highly trusted by only 18\%, 22\%, and 1\% of
   respondents respectively. Government websites (34\%) and information
   from a doctor's office (34\%) were infrequently used, but were highly
   trusted by 62\% and 60\% of respondents. Knowledge of the outbreak was
   lower among vaccine-hesitant respondents. Few mothers changed MMR
   vaccination plans after the outbreak.
   Conclusions: New mothers had high levels of knowledge and favorable
   attitudes about vaccination after the 2014-15 measles outbreak. Media
   sources used the most are not the most trusted. Communication about
   outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases should include spread of
   accurate information to new media sources and strengthening of existing
   trust in traditional media. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Development of the Healthy Work Collaborative: Findings From an Action
   Research Study to Inform a Policy, Systems, and Environmental Change
   Capacity-Building Initiative Addressing Precarious Employment},
Journal = {HEALTH PROMOTION PRACTICE},
Year = {2021},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Precarious employment (PE) is a complex problem that affects an
   increasing number of workers across all economic sectors who experience
   low wages, hazardous conditions, and few benefits, and results in
   adverse health outcomes. PE is characterized by nontraditional work
   arrangements, precluding workplace-based interventions. Policy, systems,
   and environmental initiatives that engage cross-sectoral stakeholders
   may be an applicable health promotion approach to address PE. The
   University of of Illinois at Chicago Center for Healthy Work's Healthy
   Communities through Healthy Work (HCHW) is an outreach project of the
   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Institute for
   Occupational Safety and Health-funded Center of Excellence for Total
   Worker Health that conducted a multiphased qualitative action research
   (AR) study. AR designs may be a novel approach to develop initiatives to
   address problems like PE. This article reports on HCHW's first AR phase
   to answer four research questions: (1) What are participants'
   perceptions of PE? (2) What are participants' perceptions of their roles
   in addressing PE? (3) What initiatives are under way that address PE?
   and (4) How can the findings be used to facilitate opportunities for
   healthy work? Key informant interviews with health (public health and
   health care;N= 23) and labor sector organizations (worker centers,
   worker advocacy organizations, and unions;N= 21) were conducted. Data
   were thematically analyzed alongside a chart-based content analysis, and
   shared in 11 key stakeholder meetings. Findings revealed an opportunity
   for the labor sector to improve health sector readiness to address PE in
   the context of health, and were used to develop the Healthy Work
   Collaborative, a cross-sectoral health promotion capacity building
   policy, systems, and environmenta change initiative to address PE.},

Title = {Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: Survey of drug allergy experts},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY: GLOBAL},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background: Since the publication of the 2022 Drug Allergy Practice
   Parameters (DAPP) of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma \&
   Immunology (AAAAI) and American College of Allergy, Asthma \& Immunology
   (ACAAI), it is unclear the extent to which the simplified and
   risk-stratified evaluation of cephalosporin allergy has been
   incorporated into allergy practice. Objective: We aimed to assess
   current cephalosporin allergy testing practices using real case
   examples. Methods: An 18-question REDCap survey was sent to the 136
   members of the Adverse Reactions to Drugs, Biologics and Latex (ARDBL)
   Committee of the AAAAI between February and April 2023. Results:
   Forty-six (33.8\%) ARDBL members completed the survey after 3 email
   attempts. Most practiced in the United States (32, 69.6\%), 6 (13.0\%)
   in Canada, and the rest in Europe and Asia. Almost half (47.7\%)
   reported that the 2022 DAPP had increased their use of direct oral
   challenge, and 91\% would prescribe cephalosporins in the setting of
   low-risk penicillin allergy history without testing. For low-risk
   cephalosporin reactions, 68\% would perform a direct oral challenge with
   the culprit drug. In severe immediate penicillin reactions, 23\% would
   evaluate with penicillin skin test before assessing cephalosporin
   allergy. For cephalosporin-related anaphylaxis, 48\% would perform
   cephalosporin-based tests. For perioperative anaphylaxis with cefazolin,
   57\% would perform cephalosporin-based tests. For positive skin test
   result to cefazolin, 79\% chose to avoid the culprit drug with follow-up
   oral challenge to a structurally dissimilar cephalosporin. Conclusion:
   Increased uptake of direct oral challenge represents the initial impact
   of the 2022 DAPP. However, there is significant variation in testing
   practices of cephalosporin allergy even among drug allergy experts,
   reflecting a need for a firmer evidence base to guide consensus around
   testing for higher-risk reactions.},

Title = {Current practice of antibiotic prophylaxis for surgical fixation of
   closed long bone fractures: a survey of 297 members of the Orthopaedic
   Trauma Association},
Journal = {PATIENT SAFETY IN SURGERY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {11},
Month = {JAN 16},
Abstract = {Background: The risk of postoperative surgical site infection after long
   bone fracture fixation can be decreased with appropriate antibiotic use.
   However, there is no agreement on the superiority of a single- or
   multiple-dose perioperative regimen of antibiotic prophylaxis. The
   purpose of this study is to determine the following: 1) What are the
   current practice patterns of orthopaedic trauma surgeons in using
   perioperative antibiotics for closed long bone fractures? 2) What is the
   current knowledge of published antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines among
   orthopaedic trauma surgeons? 3) Are orthopaedic surgeons willing to
   change their current practices?
   Methods: A questionnaire was distributed via email between September and
   December 2015 to 955 Orthopaedic Trauma Association members, of whom 297
   (31\%) responded.
   Results: Most surgeons (96\%) use cefazolin as first-line infection
   prophylaxis. Fifty-nine percent used a multiple-dose antibiotic regimen,
   39\% used a single-dose regimen, and 2\% varied this decision according
   to patient factors. Thirty-six percent said they were unfamiliar with
   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) antibiotic prophylaxis
   guidelines; only 30\% were able to select the correct CDC recommendation
   from a multiple-choice list. However, 44\% of surgeons said they
   followed CDC recommendations. Fifty-six percent answered that a single-
   dose antibiotic prophylaxis regimen was not inferior to a multiple-dose
   regimen. If a level-I study comparing a single preoperative dose versus
   multiple perioperative antibiotic dosing regimen for treatment of closed
   long bone fractures were published, most respondents (64\%) said they
   would fully follow these guidelines, and 22\% said they would partially
   change their practice to follow these guidelines.
   Conclusion: There is heterogeneity in the use of single- versus
   multiple-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for surgical repair of closed long
   bone fractures. Many surgeons were unsure of current evidence-based
   recommendations regarding perioperative antibiotic use. Most respondents
   indicated they would be receptive to high-level evidence regarding the
   single- versus multiple-dose perioperative prophylactic antibiotics for
   the treatment of closed long bone fractures.},

Title = {COVID-19-related uncertainty: fertility staff experiences of its
   sources, processing, responses, and consequences},
Journal = {HUMAN REPRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {38},
Number = {2},
Pages = {247-255},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {STUDY QUESTION What are fertility staff experiences of managing
   COVID-19-related uncertainty after fertility clinics re-opened? SUMMARY
   ANSWER Staff identified many COVID-19-related uncertainty sources, the
   main being the COVID-19 health threat, to which most clinics and staff
   responded effectively by implementing safety protocols and building
   strong collaborative environments that facilitated the acquisition and
   application of information to guide organizational responses during a
   rapidly changing situation, but with costs for staff and patients. WHAT
   IS KNOWN ALREADY COVID-19 created significant disruption in fertility
   care delivery, including temporary clinic closure and treatment delay.
   Patients experienced significant distress, including concerns regarding
   the impact of COVID-19 and its vaccine on fertility and pregnancy.
   Multiple studies show that COVID-19-related uncertainty is a major
   threat and burden for healthcare staff, but this has not been
   investigated in reproductive medicine. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION A
   cross-sectional, online mixed-method bilingual (English, Spanish) survey
   (active 25 January-23 May 2021) was distributed to fertility staff
   across the UK, Latin America, and Africa. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS,
   SETTING, METHODS Eligibility criteria were being a healthcare worker at
   a fertility clinic that had re-opened since its COVID-19-related
   closure, 18 years of age or older and ability to respond in English or
   Spanish. The survey was created in English, translated to Spanish, made
   available using Qualtrics, and consisted of four parts: (i) background
   and physical and mental wellbeing, (ii) open-ended questions regarding
   COVID-19 uncertainty, (iii) appraisal items regarding perceptions and
   impact of uncertainty, and (iv) changes in the workplace. The British
   Fertility Society and the African Network and Registry of Assisted
   Reproduction circulated the survey across the UK and Africa via email
   hyperlinks and social media platforms. The Argentinian Society of
   Reproductive Medicine and the Latin American Network of Assisted
   Reproduction distributed the survey across Latin America in the same
   manner. Thematic analysis was performed on responses from open-ended
   question to produce basic codes. Deductive coding grouped sub-themes
   across questions into themes related to the theory of uncertainty
   management. Descriptive statistics and repeated measures analysis of
   variance were used on the quantitative data. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE
   OF CHANCE In total, 382 staff consented to the survey, 107 did not
   complete (28\% attrition), and 275 completed. Sixty-three percent were
   women, 69\% were physicians, and 79\% worked at private clinics.
   Thematic analysis produced 727 codes, organized in 92 sub-themes, and
   abstracted into 18 themes and one meta-theme reflecting that uncertainty
   is stressful but manageable. The types of uncertainties related to the
   threat of COVID-19 (20.6\%), unpredictability of the future (19.5\%),
   failure of communication (11.4\%), and change in the workplace (8.4\%).
   Staff appraisals of negative and positive impact of uncertainty were
   significantly lower (P < 0.001) than appraisals of stress,
   controllability, and having what it takes to cope with uncertainty. To
   process uncertainty, clinics focused on information dissemination
   (30.8\%) and building a collaborative work environment (5.8\%), while
   staff employed proactive coping (41.8\%) and emotional and cognitive
   processing (9.6\%). Main organizational responses consisted on work
   restructuring (41.3\%, e.g. safety protocols), adapting to adversity
   (9.5\%, e.g.
   supplies, preparation), and welfare support (13.8\%), though staff
   perceived lack of support (17.5\%). Negative consequences of uncertainty
   were worse self- and patient welfare (12.1\%) and worse communication
   due to virtual medicine and use of mask (9.6\%). Positive consequences
   were work improvements (8.3\%), organizational adaptation (8.3\%),
   improved relationships (5.6\%), and individual adaptation (3.2\%).
   Ninety-two percent of participants thought changes experienced in the
   workplace due to COVID-19 were negative, 9.1\% nor negative nor
   positive, and 14.9\% positive. Most staff thought that their physical
   (92.4\%) and mental health (89.5\%) were good to excellent. LIMITATIONS,
   REASONS FOR CAUTION Participants were self-selected, and most were
   physicians and embryologists working at private clinics based in Latin
   America. The study did not account for how variability in national and
   regional COVID-19 policy shaped staff experiences of uncertainty. WIDER
   IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS To address COVID-19 uncertainty, clinics
   need to promote collaborative (clinic, staff, patients) processing of
   uncertainty, clear team coordination and communication, organizational
   flexibility, and provision of support to staff and patients, with an
   emphasis on cognitive coping to decrease threat of and increase
   tolerance to uncertainty. Uncertainty management interventions bespoke
   to fertility care that integrate these components may increase clinics
   resilience to COVID-19-related and other types of uncertainty. STUDY

Abstract = {We study the long -run effects of a big -push ``graduation{''} program
   in Ethiopia in which very poor households received a one-time transfer
   of productive assets ( mainly livestock ) , technical training , and
   access to savings accounts. After seven years , treatment effects on
   wealth and consumption remain economically meaningful but dissipated
   relative to the two- and three-year results. Treatment effects on other
   outcomes attenuated further. Based on absolute well-being ( e.g. , food

Abstract = {This paper investigates the relationship between government expenditure
   and non-oil private GDP in Saudi Arabia over the period 1970-2015, using
   a Markov Switching Autoregressive Model (MSAR)-which captures the
   dynamic pattern of time series and allows us to test the impact of
   government expenditure on GDP growth in finite unobserved states of the
   economy. The study results show that the growth effects of
   contemporaneous government consumption expenditure and government fixed
   capital formation expenditure are found to be negative only in the low
   (recessionary) state of the economy. This could be explained by the
   crowding out effect that exists only in recessionary periods. On the
   other hand, the disaggregated government expenditure model indicates
   that defence and security expenditure is estimated to have the expected
   negative and significant impact on non-oil private GDP growth, but only
   in the low state. In addition, out of the three highest government civil
   items of expenditure, human resources development is found to have a
   positive and significant growth effect in both states of the economy,
   while the growth effect of the other two types (health and economic
   development expenditure) is found to be insignificant in the low state.
   This insignificant growth effect of some types of government expenditure
   in the low state of non-oil private GDP could be explained by the
   procyclical nature of government expenditure because of the excessive
   dependency on oil revenues.},

Month = {MAR 5},
Abstract = {Background: This study describes the development of a social marketing
   campaign for increasing walking in a low income, high crime community as
   part of the Positive Action for Today's Health (PATH) trial.
   Methods: Focus groups were conducted with 52 African American adults
   (ages 18 to 65 yrs), from two underserved communities to develop themes
   for a social marketing campaign to promote walking. Participants
   responded to questions concerning social marketing principles related to
   product, price, place, promotion, and positioning for increasing
   neighbourhood walking.
   Results: Focus group data informed the development of the campaign
   objectives that were derived from the ``5 Ps{''} to promote physical and
   mental health, social connectedness, safety, and confidence in walking
   regularly. Focus group themes indicated that physical and mental health
   benefits of walking were important motivators. Walking for social
   reasons was also important for overcoming barriers to walking. Police
   support from trusted officers while walking was also essential to
   promoting safety for walking. Print materials were developed by the
   steering committee, with a 12-month calendar and door hangers delivered
   to residents' homes to invite them to walk. Pride Stride walks empowered
   community walkers to serve as peer leaders for special walking events to
   engage new walkers.
   Conclusions: Essential elements for developing culturally tailored
   social marketing interventions for promoting walking in underserved
   communities are outlined for future researchers.},

Title = {Conflict ecologies: connecting political ecology and peace and conflict
   studies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Pages = {239-260},
Abstract = {Conflict is at the core of many political ecology studies. Yet there has
   been limited engagement between political ecology and the field of peace
   and conflict studies. This lack of connection reflects in part the
   broader disciplinary context of these two fields. Whereas political
   ecology research mostly comes from disciplines that eschewed
   environmental determinism, such as human geography, much of peace and
   conflict studies is associated with political science using positivist
   approaches to determine the causal effects of environmental factors on
   conflicts. Yet greater connections are possible, notably in light of
   political ecology's renewed engagement with `materialism', and peace and
   conflict studies' increasingly nuanced mixed-methods research on
   environment-related conflicts. Furthermore, political ecology's emphasis
   on uneven power relations and pursuit of environmental justice resonates
   with the structural violence approaches and social justice agenda of
   peace and conflict studies. This article provides an overview of the
   differing conceptualizations and analyses of environmental conflict
   under the labels of political ecology and peace and conflict studies,
   and points at opportunities for closer connections.},

Title = {GLOBAL TRENDS FOR TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION - RESULTS OF THE BIT SURVEY ACROSS
   TEN COUNTRIES},
Booktitle = {UCLA ANDERSON BUSINESS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES (BIT) PROJECT: A
   GLOBAL STUDY OF BUSINESS PRACTICE (2012)},
Year = {2013},
Pages = {3-27},
Abstract = {The Business and Information Technologies (BIT) Survey is aimed at
   understanding global and longitudinal trends resulting from the adoption
   by businesses of new and online information and communication
   technologies. Partnering research institutions have conducted the survey
   in their own country and data is shared among the BIT partners. This
   report shows the global trends observed by compiling the data received
   from partnering research institutions in ten countries that conducted
   the same survey in their respective countries.
   The subject group for all surveys consists of organizations or
   sub-organizations that have the ability to make technology management
   decisions (acquisition, implementation, and maintenance) independently.
   The survey is sent to Chief Information Officers (CIOs) and other senior
   officers, a role that is deemed to be most knowledgeable about the
   business and technology issues in the survey questionnaire.
   Business and technology issues in the survey questionnaire include the
   following:
   Technology Adoption
   Internal Organization
   Forward Facing Interactions
   Backward Facing Interactions
   Business Results
   Outsourcing
   Globalization
   The major global trends observed are summarized below.
   Technology adoption trends are similar across countries, with the
   proportions varying among the countries. Newer technologies such as RFID
   and biometrics, though not highly adopted currently, are on the planned
   adoption list of many countries. Chile and Colombia show high adoption
   rates for some of the newer technologies such as digital receipts and
   enterprise instant messaging.
   Security budgets are observed to be increasing for Spanish, Italian, and
   American firms. Budget trends for outsourcing and on-demand computing
   are increasing less than other technology-related applications and
   processes. If on-demand computing is viewed as the initial step toward
   cloud computing, then the lower budgets allocated to it could be an
   indication of a lag between hype and reality for cloud computing.
   Workforce in the internal organizational is more skilled at lower
   levels, collaborating with peers and asking for intelligent systems at
   executive levels. Firms in New Zealand use telecommuting and firms in
   Chile report observing the IT function shifting from staff to line.
   Structurally, organizations are becoming heterarchical and front office
   staff is becoming empowered as measured by the monitoring, automation
   and incentivization of customer facing interactions.
   Business processes handling money such as accounting and finance are
   out-sourced to a lesser extent than the business processes related to
   technology. German firms outsource programming, Chilean firms outsource
   accounting, firms in New Zealand outsource data center operations,
   network management and market research, and Spanish and Italian firms
   outsource payroll and market research.
   A large proportion of Chilean firms had a traditional only presence.
   Many Italian firms also have brick and mortar stores only. Many firms in
   New Zealand, Spain, Taiwan and Korea have a traditional and an online
   presence. A small proportion of companies in Taiwan offer some services
   online only.
   While new touch points such as email and website brochures are becoming
   popular, traditional touch points including phone, face-to-face and mail
   continue to remain popular for interfacing with customers. Colombian
   firms prefer to reach out to their customers using traditional
   mechanisms with Referrals remaining popular.
   Fewer firms are analyzing their customer data and segmenting customers
   for more customized marketing. Taiwan and Spain are using customer
   profiling for customer data analysis. Firms in Spain, New Zealand and
   Colombia are segmenting customers by geography and Taiwanese firms are
   using user communities.
   In going online, firms are observing more self service by customers and
   collect more data. Sales volume is high and more products and services
   are offered by Taiwanese companies for online business.
   While the traditional B2B purchasing mechanisms continue to remain
   popular, newer mechanisms including OEM links/hubs (Colombia), buy-side
   and sell-side exchanges and hubs (Spain) and aggregators (Germany) are
   also being adopted.
   Based on responses from the survey, globalization could be associated to
   geographic proximity, language commonality and cost benefit. Columbian
   firms show less globalization. Incentives for increased globalization
   could include cost advantage, access to a more skilled staff and new
   markets.},

Abstract = {BackgroundParents were at the forefront of responding to the needs of
   children during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study used the RE-AIM
   framework to examine the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation,
   and Maintenance of a global inter-agency initiative that adapted
   evidence-based parenting programs to provide immediate support to
   parents.MethodsData were collected via short surveys sent via email,
   online surveys, and analysis of social media metrics and Google
   Analytics. Retrospective surveys with 1,303 parents and caregivers in 11
   countries examined impacts of the resources on child maltreatment,
   positive relationship building, parenting efficacy, and parenting
   stress.ResultsThe parenting resources were translated into over 135
   languages and dialects; reached an estimated minimum 212.4 million
   people by June 2022; were adopted by 697 agencies, organizations, and
   individuals; and were included in 43 national government COVID-19
   responses. Dissemination via social media had the highest reach (n =
   144,202,170, 67.9\%), followed by radio broadcasts (n = 32,298,525,
   15.2\%), text messages (n = 13,565,780, 6.4\%), and caseworker phone
   calls or visits (n = 8,074,787, 3.8\%). Retrospective surveys showed
   increased parental engagement and play, parenting self-efficacy,
   confidence in protecting children from sexual abuse, and capacity to
   cope with stress, as well as decreased physical and emotional abuse.
   Forty-four organizations who responded to follow-up surveys in April
   2021 reported sustained use of the resources as part of existing
   services and other crisis responses.ConclusionThis study highlights the
   importance of a) establishing an international collaboration to rapidly
   adapt and disseminate evidence-based content into easily accessible
   resources that are relevant to the needs of parents; b) creating
   open-source and agile delivery models that are responsive to local
   contexts and receptive to further adaptation; and c) using the best
   methods available to evaluate a rapidly deployed global emergency
   response in real-time. Further research is recommended to empirically
   establish the evidence of effectiveness and maintenance of these
   parenting innovations.},

Title = {Mapping the Cultural Repertoires of Family Estrangement: A New Theory of
   Democratized Kinship},
Journal = {SOCIAL PROBLEMS},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 MAY 31},
Abstract = {Research on the causes of family of origin estrangement-the severing of
   contact between family of origin members-has focused on the
   psychological and the circumstantial, missing important cultural
   dynamics that shape estrangement decisions. The present study uses
   in-depth interview data from 68 adults living in the United States to
   determine the specific cultural repertoires (Swidler 2001) that adults
   use to estrange. This study further demarcates the specific locations
   from which estrangement repertoires are learned. Findings show the
   repertoire of democratized kinship is used to create strategies of
   action to estrange. Democratized kinship is a legacy of ``pure{''}
   intimacy, with relational demands for accountability, evolution,
   intentional connection, mutual respect, and safety. Democratized kinship
   is transmitted through novel social ties and circulating therapeutic
   discourses found in social media and formal therapy. This study
   contributes to longstanding debates regarding the sociological causes of
   not only estrangement but also relationship disruption more broadly, and
   situates democratized kinship as a newly identified cultural repertoire
   used to end family relationships.},

Title = {Protocol of a randomized controlled trial of the Tobacco Tactics website
   for operating engineers},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAY 8},
Abstract = {Background: Recent research indicates that 35 percent of blue-collar
   workers in the US currently smoke while only 20 percent of white-collar
   workers smoke. Over the last year, we have been working with heavy
   equipment operators, specifically the Local 324 Training Center of the
   International Union of Operating Engineers, to study the epidemiology of
   smoking, which is 29\% compared to 21\% among the general population.
   For the current study funded by the National Cancer Institute
   (1R21CA152247-01A1), we have developed the Tobacco Tactics website which
   will be compared to the state supported 1-800-QUIT-NOW telephone line.
   Outcome evaluation will compare those randomized to the Tobacco Tactics
   web-based intervention to those randomized to the 1-800-QUIT-NOW control
   condition on: a) 30-day and 6-month quit rates; b) cotinine levels; c)
   cigarettes smoked/day; d) number of quit attempts; and e) nicotine
   addiction. Process evaluation will compare the two groups on the: a)
   contacts with intervention; b) medications used; c) helpfulness of the
   nurse/coach; and d) willingness to recommend the intervention to others.
   Methods/Design: This will be a randomized controlled trial (N = 184).
   Both interventions will be offered during regularly scheduled safety
   training at Local 324 Training Center of the International Union of
   Operating Engineers and both will include optional provision of
   over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapy and the same number of
   telephone contacts. However, the Tobacco Tactics website has graphics
   tailored to Operating Engineers, tailored cessation feedback from the
   website, and follow up nurse counseling offered by multimedia options
   including phone and/or email, and/or e-community. Primary Analysis of
   Aim 1 will be conducted by using logistic regression to compare smoking
   habits (e. g., quit rates) of those in the intervention arm to those in
   the control arm. Primary analyses for Aim 2 will compare process
   measures (e. g., medications used) between the two groups by linear,
   logistic, and Poisson regression.
   Discussion: Dissemination of an efficacious work-site, web-based smoking
   cessation intervention has the potential to substantially impact cancer
   rates among this population. Based on the outcome of this smaller study,
   wider scale testing in conjunction with the International Environment
   Technology Testing Center which services Operating Engineers across
   North America (including US, Mexico, and Canada) will be conducted.},

Title = {A framework to determine the effectiveness of dietary exposure
   mitigation to chemical contaminants},
Journal = {FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {74},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In order to ensure the food safety, risk managers may implement measures
   to reduce human exposure to contaminants via food consumption. The
   evaluation of the effect of a measure is often an overlooked step in
   risk analysis process. The aim of this study was to develop a systematic
   approath for determining the effectiveness of mitigation measures to
   reduce dietary exposure to chemical contaminants. Based on expert
   opinion, a general framework for evaluation of the effectiveness of
   measures to reduce human exposure to food contaminants was developed.
   The general outline was refined by application to three different cases:
   1) methyl mercury in fish and fish products, 2) deoxynivalenol in cereal
   grains, and 3) furan in heated products. It was found that many
   uncertainties and natural variations exist, which make it difficult to
   assess the impact of the mitigation measure. Whenever possible,
   quantitative methods should be used to describe the current variation
   and uncertainty. Additional data should be collected to cover natural
   variability and reduce uncertainty. For the time being, it is always
   better for the risk manager to have access to all available information,
   including an assessment of uncertainty; however, the proposed
   methodology provides a conceptual framework for addressing these
   systematically. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is

Title = {Design, synthesis, and biological activity of Plastoquinone analogs as a
   new class of anticancer agents},
Journal = {BIOORGANIC CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {92},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In this paper, based on Plastoquinone (PQ) analogs possessing
   substituted aniline containing alkoxy group(s), new
   2,3-dimethyl-5-amino-1,4-benzoquinones (PQ1-15) were designed and
   synthesized in either two steps or one-pot reaction. Specifically, the
   substituted amino moiety containing mono or poly alkoxy group(s) with
   various positions and groups were mainly explored to understand the
   structure-activity relationships for the cytotoxic activity against
   three human cancer cell lines (K562, Jurkat, and MT-2) and human
   peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). PQ2 was found to be most
   effective anticancer compound on K562 and Jurkat cell lines with IC50
   values of 6.40 +/- 1.73 mu M and 7.72 +/- 1.49 mu M, respectively.
   Interestingly, the compound was non-cytotoxic to normal PBMC and also
   MT-2 cancer cells. PQ2 which showed significant selectivity in MTT assay
   was chosen for apoptotic/necrotic evaluation and results exhibited that
   it induced apoptosis in K562 cell line after 6 h of treatment. PQ2
   showed anti-Abelson kinase 1 (Abl1) activity with different inhibitory
   profile than Imatinib in the panel of eight kinases. The binding mode of
   PQ2 into Abl ATP binding pocket was predicted in silico showing the
   formation of some key interactions. In addition, PQ2 induced Bcr-Abll
   mediated ERK pathway in human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells.
   Furthermore, DNA-cleaving capability of PQ2 was clearly enhanced by iron
   (II) complex system. Afterward, a further in silico ADMET prediction
   revealed that PQ2 possesses desirable drug-like properties and favorable
   safety profile. These results indicated that PQ2 has multiple mechanism
   of action and two of them are anti-Bcr-Abl1 and DNA-cleaving activity.
   This study suggests that Plastoquinone analogs could be potential
   candidates for multi-target anticancer therapy.},

Title = {A Survey of Nursing Home Physicians to Determine Laboratory Monitoring
   Adverse Drug Event Alert Preferences},
Journal = {APPLIED CLINICAL INFORMATICS},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {5},
Number = {4},
Pages = {895-906},
Abstract = {Objective: We conducted a survey of nursing home physicians to learn
   about (1) the laboratory value thresholds that clinical event monitors
   should use to generate alerts about potential adverse drug events
   (ADEs); (2) the specific information to be included in the alerts; and
   (3) the communication modality that should be used for communicating
   them.
   Methods: Nursing home physician attendees of the 2010 Conference of
   AMDA: The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.
   Results: A total of 800 surveys were distributed; 565 completed surveys
   were returned and seven surveys were excluded due to inability to verify
   that the respondents were physicians (a 70\% net valid response rate).
   Alerting threshold preferences were identified for eight laboratory
   tests. For example, the majority of respondents selected thresholds of
   >= 5.5 mEq/L for hyperkalemia (63\%) and <= 3.5 without symptoms for
   hypokalemia (54\%). The majority of surveyed physicians thought alerts
   should include the complete active medication list, current vital signs,
   previous value of the triggering lab, medication change in the past 30
   days, and medication allergies. Most surveyed physicians felt the best
   way to communicate an ADE alert was by direct phone/voice communication
   (64\%), followed by email to a mobile device (59\%).
   Conclusions: This survey of nursing home physicians suggests that the
   majority prefer alerting thresholds that would generally lead to fewer
   alerts than if widely accepted standardized laboratory ranges were used.
   It also suggests a subset of information items to include in alerts, and
   the physicians' preferred communication modalities. This information
   might improve the acceptance of clinical event monitoring systems to
   detect ADEs in the nursing home setting.},

Title = {How Ohio public library systems respond to opioid-related substance use:
   a descriptive analysis of survey results},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 17},
Abstract = {Background Public libraries in the United States have experienced
   increases in opioid-related substance use in their communities and on
   their premises. This includes fatal and non-fatal overdose events. Some
   libraries have adopted response measures in their branches to deter
   substance use or prevent overdose. A small number of libraries around
   the nation have decided to stock the opioid antagonist naloxone (Narcan)
   for staff to administer to patrons who experience overdose. This
   response measure has generated extensive media attention. Although Ohio
   ranks fourth in age-adjusted drug mortality rate in the United States,
   there has been no investigation of whether Ohio libraries are observing
   opioid-related transactions, consumption, and/or overdose events, or
   which measures they have adopted in response to these activities. We
   conducted a multimethod survey with Ohio public library directors to
   identify the response measures they have adopted. We present descriptive
   findings from the quantitative and qualitative items in our
   survey.Methods We conducted a cross-sectional 54-item multimethod survey
   of public library system directors (one per system) in Ohio. Directors
   of each of Ohio's public library systems were invited to participate via
   email.Results Of 251 library systems, 56 responded (22.3\% response
   rate), with 34 respondents (60.7\%) indicating awareness of
   opioid-related transactions, consumption, and/or overdose on their
   premises. Most (n = 43, 76.8\%) did not stock naloxone in their
   buildings. Over half (n = 34, 60.7\%) reported implementing one or more
   non-naloxone response measures. These measures focus on improving
   security for staff and patrons, deterring opioid-related transactions
   (purchases and exchanges) and consumption, and providing educational
   events on substance use. Nearly half (n = 25, 47.2\%) partner with
   community organizations to provide opioid response measures. A similar
   proportion reported adequate funding to respond to opioid-related
   substance use (n = 23, 45.1\%), and most (n = 38, 74.5\%) reported
   adequate support from their boards and communities. Few respondents have
   implemented evaluations of their response measures.Conclusions Ohio
   public libraries are responding to evidence of opioid-related
   transactions, consumption, and/or overdose on their premises with a
   range of measures that focus on substance use prevention and deterrence.
   Most Ohio library systems do not stock naloxone. Respondents indicated
   they prefer to call 911 and let first responders handle overdose events.
   The majority of respondents indicated their library systems have
   political capacity to respond to evidence of opioid-related substance
   use on their premises, but have limited operational and functional
   capacity. Findings suggest the need to revisit assumptions that public
   libraries are willing to stock naloxone to respond to overdose events,
   and that libraries have the resources to respond robustly to
   opioid-related transactions, consumption, and/or overdose on their
   premises.},

Title = {Mobile phone messaging reminders for attendance at healthcare
   appointments},
Journal = {COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS},
Year = {2012},
Number = {7},
Abstract = {Background
   Missed appointments are a major cause of inefficiency in healthcare
   delivery, with substantial monetary costs for the health system, leading
   to delays in diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Patients'
   forgetfulness is one of the main reasons for missed appointments, and
   reminders may help alleviate this problem. Modes of communicating
   reminders for appointments to patients include face-to-face
   communication, postal messages, calls to landlines or mobile phones, and
   mobile phone messaging. Mobile phone messaging applications such as
   Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia Message Service (MMS) could
   provide an important, inexpensive delivery medium for reminders for
   healthcare appointments.
   Objectives To assess the effects of mobile phone messaging reminders for
   attendance at healthcare appointments. Secondary objectives include
   assessment of patients' and healthcare providers' evaluation of the
   intervention; costs; and possible risks and harms associated with the
   intervention.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL,
   The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to
   June 2009), EMBASE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), PsycINFO
   (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (January 1993
   to June 2009), LILACS (January 1993 to June 2009) and African Health
   Anthology (January 1993 to June 2009). We also reviewed grey literature
   (including trial registers) and reference lists of articles.
   Selection criteria
   We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised
   controlled trials (QRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, or
   interrupted time series (ITS) studies with at least three time points
   before and after the intervention. We included studies assessing mobile
   phone messaging as reminders for healthcare appointments. We only
   included studies in which it was possible to assess effects of mobile
   phone messaging independent of other technologies or interventions.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently assessed all studies against the
   inclusion criteria, with any disagreements resolved by a third review
   author. Study design features, characteristics of target populations,
   interventions and controls, and results data were extracted by two
   review authors and confirmed by a third author. Primary outcomes of
   interest were rate of attendance at healthcare appointments. We also
   considered health outcomes as a result of the intervention, patients'
   and providers' evaluation of the intervention, perceptions of safety,
   costs, and potential harms or adverse effects. As the intervention
   characteristics and outcome measures were similar across included
   studies, we conducted a meta-analysis to estimate an overall effect
   size.
   Main results
   We included four randomised controlled trials involving 3547
   participants. Three studies with moderate quality evidence showed that
   mobile text message reminders improved the rate of attendance at
   healthcare appointments compared to no reminders (risk ratio (RR) 1.10
   (95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.17)). One low quality study
   reported that mobile text message reminders with postal reminders,
   compared to postal reminders, improved rate of attendance at healthcare
   appointments (RR 1.10 (95\% CI 1.02 to 1.19)). However, two studies with
   moderate quality of evidence showed that mobile phone text message
   reminders and phone call reminders had a similar impact on healthcare
   attendance (RR 0.99 (95\% CI 0.95 to 1.03). The costs per attendance of
   mobile phone text message reminders were shown to be lower compared to
   phone call reminders. None of the included studies reported outcomes
   related to harms or adverse effects of the intervention, nor health
   outcomes or user perception of safety related to the intervention.
   Authors' conclusions
   There is moderate quality evidence that mobile phone text message
   reminders are more effective than no reminders, and low quality evidence
   that text message reminders with postal reminders are more effective
   than postal reminders alone. Further, according to the moderate quality
   evidence we found, mobile phone text message reminders are as effective
   as phone call reminders. Overall, there is limited evidence on the
   effects of mobile phone text message reminders for appointment
   attendance, and further high-quality research is required to draw more
   robust conclusions.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: The way in which a health technology is used in any
   particular health system depends on the decisions and actions of a
   variety of stakeholders, the local culture, and context. In 2009, the
   HTAi Policy Forum considered how health technology assessment (HTA)
   could be improved to optimize the use of technologies (in terms of
   uptake, change in use, or disinvestment) in such complex systems.
   Methods: In scoping, it was agreed to focus on initiatives to implement
   evidence-based guidance and monitoring activities. A review identified
   systematic reviews of implementation initiatives and monitoring
   activities. A two-day deliberative workshop was held to discuss key
   papers, members' experiences, and collectively address key questions.
   This consensus paper was developed by email and finalized at a
   postworkshop meeting.
   Results: Evidence suggests that the impact and use of HTA could be
   increased by ensuring timely delivery of relevant reports to clearly
   determined policy receptor (decision-making) points. To achieve this,
   the breadth of assessment, implementation initiatives such as incentives
   and targeted, intelligent dissemination of HTA result, needs to be
   considered. HTA stakeholders undertake a variety of monitoring
   activities, which could inform optimal use of a technology. However, the
   quality of these data varies and is often not submitted to an HTA.
   Conclusions: Monitoring data should be sufficiently robust so that they
   can be used in HTA to inform optimal use of technology. Evidence-based
   implementation initiatives should be developed for HTA, to better inform
   decision makers at all levels in a health system about the optimal use
   of technology.},

Journal = {BREAST},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {42},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Fertility and pregnancy-related issues are major concerns
   for young breast cancer patients. Limited data are available on
   physicians' knowledge, attitudes and practice in these fields.
   Methods: A 26-item questionnaire exploring 3 different topics (fertility
   preservation, pregnancy after breast cancer and breast cancer during
   pregnancy) was sent by email to physicians attending the 2016 3rd
   European School of Oncology (ESO) - European Society for Medical
   Oncology (ESMO) Breast Cancer in Young Women Conference (BCY3) and the
   15th St. Gallen International Breast Cancer Conference 2017 (BCC 2017).
   Given the selected sample, survey respondents were expected to have a
   higher than average interest in the management of breast cancer
   patients. Descriptive analyses were performed.
   Results: A total of 273 physicians (105 at BCY3 and 168 at BCC 2017)
   completed the survey; 37.0\%, 46.9\% and 34.8\% reported never having
   consulted the available international guidelines on fertility
   preservation, pregnancy after breast cancer and management of breast
   cancer during pregnancy, respectively. Up to 18.3\% of respondents did
   not know if the different fertility preservation options were available
   in their country; 22.3\% suggested that controlled ovarian stimulation
   should not be considered safe in patients with hormone receptor-positive
   disease. A total of 30.4\% of respondents agreed or were neutral on the
   statement that pregnancy in breast cancer survivors may increase the
   risk of recurrence. Regarding breast cancer during pregnancy, 23.8\% and
   38.1\% disagreed or were neutral on the statements that endocrine
   therapy and anti-HER2 agents should be avoided during pregnancy,
   respectively.
   Conclusions: Further educational initiatives are needed to improve
   physicians' knowledge and adherence to available guidelines when
   addressing fertility and pregnancy-related issues in young breast cancer
   patients. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {DEFENCE AND SECURITY ANALYSIS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {31},
Number = {1},
Pages = {74-82},
Abstract = {This article describes the results of research into the social
   phenomenon of ``respect{''} as framed by junior members of the British
   Army, as part of a wider study into the Values and Standards of the
   British Army. This research was interview based, using qualitative
   analysis software to detect, manage, and draw conclusions from the
   qualitative data recorded in those interviews. The data indicated that
   the primary situation in which ``respect{''} was visualised by the
   participants was the unit context, and that it comprised a combination
   of three different strands: respect for rank or ``hierarchical
   respect,{''} `` professional respect{''} for a person's military
   competence, and ``personal respect{''} for an individual's character,
   personal behaviour, and attributes. The overall respect that an
   individual is given arises from the combination of these three areas.
   ``Respect{''} as a concept was, in the soldiers' characterisation,
   something that had to be earned (except for the ``given{''} represented
   by rank) and was not stable: a person's fund of respect could go up or
   down in social value. Respect was also linked to trust: the more respect
   a person had, the more they could be trusted. Although the unit context
   was the primary one for discussing their framing of the concept of
   respect, many of the participants reported a wider dimension in which
   every human being deserves a basic level of respect simply for being
   human, and this level could not be forfeited.},

Abstract = {Background: Speculation on benefits and harms of prescription,
   over-the-counter and complementary medications has been widespread
   during the SARS-CoV-2 (or COVID-19) pandemic. This community-based
   survey assessed self-reported changes in medications including those
   stopped, started, or if access had been impacted. Methods: A survey was
   collected via Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). The survey was
   advertised in the community through social media, email lists, websites,
   and post-cards. Survey responses were collected between 5/21/2020 and
   6/24/2020. Variables included demographic characteristics such as age,
   sex, race, marital status, education, employment, income, and community
   type. Questions related to medication changes included: ``Have you
   started any medication due to COVID-19?{''}, ``Have you stopped any
   medication due to COVID-19?{''} and ``Have you had issues getting your
   prescription medications?{''}. Respondents aged 50 years or older were
   included. Results: There were N = 1397 responses of which 1169 were
   older adults >= 50 years-old. Of these, 1141 responded to the medication
   changes survey questions and 28 had missing responses and were excluded
   from the survey sample for this analysis. Among these, 31 (2.7\%)
   reported a medication change included 5 (0.4\%) reported stopping a
   medication, 18 (1.6\%) reported starting a medication, and 8 (0.7\%)
   reported trouble obtaining medications. Medications started included
   mostly vitamins or other supplements including zinc (n = 9), vitamin C
   (6), and other supplements (3). Among prescription medications,
   antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications (4) were reported as well
   as aspirin (1), losartan (1), and low dose naltrexone (1). One
   respondent reported unidentified homeopathy. There were no significant
   differences between those with medication changes and those with none.
   Conclusions: In this community-based survey sample of over one thousand
   older adults, only a small percentage (2.7\%; n = 31) reported any
   changes to medications during the pandemic. As essential workers during
   this crisis, pharmacists have played a critical role in providing
   medication information and continued access.},

Title = {Lost in translation: a national cross-sectional study on medical

Abstract = {Background Lack of communication in a family's preferred language is
   inequitable and results in inferior care. Pediatric residents provide
   care to many families with non-English or French language preferences
   (NEFLP). There is no data available about how Canadian pediatric
   residents use interpreters, making it difficult to develop targeted
   interventions to improve patient experience.Objectives Our purpose was
   to assess translation services in pediatric training centers and
   evaluate resident perception of their clinical skills when working with
   NEFLP patients and families. This survey represents the first collection
   of data from Canadian pediatric residents about interpreter
   services.Methods Eligible participants included all pediatric residents
   enrolled in an accredited Canadian pediatric training program. An
   anonymous survey was developed in REDCap (c) and distributed via email
   to all pediatric residents across Canada. Descriptive statistics were
   performed in STATA v15.1.Results 122 residents responded. Interpreter
   services were widely available but underused in a variety of clinical
   situations. Most (85\%) residents felt they provided better care to
   patients who shared their primary language (English or French), compared
   with families who preferred other languages-even when an interpreter was
   present. This finding was consistent across four self-assessed clinical
   skills.Conclusions Residents are more confident in their clinical and
   communication skills when working with families who share their primary
   language. Our findings suggest that residents lack the training and
   confidence to provide equal care to families with varying language
   preferences. Pediatric training programs should develop curriculum
   content that targets safe and effective interpreter use while reviewing
   non-spoken aspects of cultural awareness and safety. Key Messages: What
   is already known on this topic. Healthcare interactions between
   providers and non-English speaking patients can result in decreased
   understanding of medical information, fewer opportunities to build a
   relationship with their provider, and risk of medical error. The use of
   professional interpreter services, whether in person or by telephone or
   video, can help to alleviate some of these risks. Patients and their
   families feel that their care is improved when practitioners speak to
   them in their preferred language. What this study adds. This study is
   the first to examine interpreter services available in Canadian
   pediatric training centers and assess residents' perception of their
   use. Interestingly, residents identify that the use of an interpreter
   only somewhat improves their abilities to perform clinical duties and
   build rapport with families who speak other languages. This finding
   illuminates that residency training programs must do more to educate
   trainees about safe and equitable care, and provides opportunity for
   future study of what families may feel is missing from their care. How
   this study might affect research, practice, or policy. Our results
   indicate the need for pediatric centers to implement easily accessible
   forms of translation services that can be used in the moment by care
   providers in all areas of the hospital. Training programs should
   investigate practitioner- and system-specific factors that prevent
   residents from performing at their best when working with patients who
   prefer a non-English language.},

Title = {Disclosure and the Evolving Legal Consciousness of Sexual and Gender

Abstract = {Sexual and gender minority (SGM) migrants' disclosure of their identity
   or ``coming out{''} has significant stakes. It can facilitate access to
   resources (institutional disclosure), cultivate intimacy and belonging
   (social disclosure), or support claims for legal protections (legal
   disclosure). This article analyzes SGM unaccompanied minors' disclosures
   as shaped by the evolution of their legal consciousness in pursuing
   legal relief and incorporation in the United States. Ethnographic
   observations and in-depth interviews from 2014-2019 with 11 SGM
   unaccompanied minors reveal a striking pattern in their disclosure
   practices. During apprehension and detention, minors engaged in social,
   institutional, and legal disclosure of their SGM status. However, their
   interactions with agents from the Departments of Homeland Security and
   Health and Human Services led them to believe that SGM rights, support,
   and acceptance were contingent on legal status. Later, upon release from
   state custody, minors withheld legal disclosure from their deportation
   proceedings and immigration cases, even against the advisement of their
   attorneys. They also became more strategic in their social and
   institutional disclosure across other contexts. Post-legalization,
   however, minors broadened their disclosure practices and embarked on
   claims related to their SGM status. This study raises implications for
   research and policy. By analyzing shifts in legal consciousness over
   time, how certain experiences become reference points for how immigrants
   understand the law with respect to their identity and related behaviors
   are illustrated. It also extends the discussion of the far-reaching
   implications of SGM punishment and the disadvantages of immigration
   detention for children and youth.},

Title = {Exploring attitudinal barriers to participation in inpatient fall risk
   assessment using the Theoretical Domains Framework: A survey of
   providers},
Journal = {HEALTH SCIENCE REPORTS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {7},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background and AimsLack of provider (physicians and advanced practice
   providers) participation in fall risk assessment was theorized to be
   contributing to rising rates of falls with injury at our institution.
   This project sought to identify if attitudinal barriers to inpatient
   provider participation in fall risk assessment were similar to those
   identified in other clinical settings.MethodsBarriers to provider
   participation in fall risk assessment were identified in the literature.
   These were mapped to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) domains to
   assist with interpretation of the data. A 10-item survey using a 5-point
   Likert scale (strongly agree to strongly disagree) with two open-ended
   questions was developed using these barriers. The survey was distributed
   via email to all providers on the Medical Staff in July 2021.ResultsThe
   response rate was 9.1\% (188/2062). 72.6\% (95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI]: 65.6, 78.5) of providers at our institution did agree that fall
   risk assessment was within their role and 72\% (95\% CI: 66.1, 78.5)
   agreed that assessment can prevent falls. Nearly half felt that they
   lacked formal training in fall risk assessment (48.1\% {[}95\% CI: 41.1,
   55.1]) and 52.2\% (95\% CI: 44.6, 58.6) agreed that other aspects of
   patient care took priority over falls assessment. These barriers
   correlated best with the TDF domains of Beliefs about Capabilities and
   Beliefs about Consequences.ConclusionsSurvey results indicate that
   interventions focused on increasing provider motivation and capability
   regarding fall risk assessment and helping providers prioritize fall
   risk assessment are potential targets for future quality improvement
   projects.
   The Theoretical Domains Framework can be used in survey development and
   translation of qualitative data into quality improvement initiatives
   that are then based on evidence-based behavioral change theory. The
   barriers perceived to have the most impact on provider engagement in
   fall risk assessment in the inpatient setting included the need to
   prioritize other aspects of patient care and the lack of training in
   fall risk assessment. These barriers speak to lack of motivation, which
   may be positively impacted by interventions that balance capability and
   opportunity, such as an easy tool in the electronic health record.},

Abstract = {Cataract was used as a model for the prevalence and economic impact of
   adverse events during the drug development process. Meta-analysis
   revealed a reported prevalence of cataract at 12.0\% (1.0-43.3\%), 3.8\%
   (2.4-12.5\%), 1.0\% (0.0-8.1\%), 1.7\% (0.0-34.8\%) and 3.8\%
   (2.3-5.7\%) of compounds in preclinical, Phase I, II, III and IV
   clinical trials, respectively. Utilising a human-based in vitro
   screening assay to predict cataractogenic potential in human could allow
   better selection of novel compounds at early stage drug development.
   This could significantly reduce costs and ultimately increase the
   probability of a drug obtaining FDA approval for a clinical application.},

Title = {E-mail in patient-provider communication: A systematic review},
Journal = {PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {80},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Objective: To review systematically the role of e-mails in
   patient-provider communication in terms of e-mail content, and
   perspectives of providers and patients on e-mail communication in health
   care.
   Methods: A systematic review of studies on e-mail communication between
   patients and health providers in regular health care published from 2000
   to 2008.
   Results: A total of 24 studies were included in the review. Among these
   studies, 21 studies examined e-mail communication between patients and
   providers, and three studies examined the e-mail communication between
   parents of patients in pediatric primary care and pediatricians. In the
   content analyses of e-mail messages, topics well represented were
   medical information exchange, medical condition or update, medication
   information, and subspecialty evaluation. A number of personal and
   institutional features were associated with the likelihood of e-mail use
   between patients and providers. While benefits of e-mails in enhancing
   communication were recognized by both patients and providers, concerns
   about confidentiality and security were also expressed.
   Conclusion: The e-mail is transforming the relationship between patients
   and providers. The rigorous exploration of pros and cons of electronic
   interaction in health care settings will help make e-mail communication
   a more powerful, mutually beneficial health care provision tool.
   Practice implications: It is important to develop an electronic
   communication system for the clinical practice that can address a range
   of concerns. More efforts need to be made to educate patients and
   providers to appropriately and effectively use e-mail for communication.

Abstract = {Roundup, and other glyphosate-based herbicides, are the most heavily
   used pesticides in the history of the USA and globally. In March 2015,
   the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified
   glyphosate as a ``probable human carcinogen{''}. A portion of the
   695,000 Americans then living in 2015 with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)
   became aware of IARC's decision. Several thousand Roundup-NHL lawsuits
   had been filed by the end of 2017, rising to 18,400 by July 2019 and
   42,000 by November 2019. Three cases have gone to trial, each won by the
   plaintiffs. The author has served as an expert witness for the
   plaintiffs in this litigation and has been compensated for his time
   spent. The impact of the litigation on the independent assessment of the
   science useful in determining whether glyphosate and glyphosate-based
   herbicide exposures are linked to NHL is reviewed, as is why the US
   Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and IARC reached such different
   judgements regarding glyphosate human cancer hazard and risk. Two
   important ``lessons learned{''} regarding the EPA versus IARC assessment
   of glyphosate cancer hazard and risk are highlighted. The first arises
   from differences in the magnitude of applicator risks from mostly dermal
   exposures to formulated glyphosate-based herbicides compared to just
   dietary exposures to technical glyphosate. The second relates to missed
   opportunities to markedly lower applicator exposures and risks with
   little or no impact on sales via reformulation, added warnings and
   worker safety provisions, company-driven stewardship programmes and
   greater determination by the EPA in the 1980s to compel Monsanto to add
   common-sense worker protection provisions onto Roundup labels (eg ``wear
   gloves when applying this product{''}). Policy reforms designed to
   alleviate systemic problems with how pesticide hazards, exposures and
   risks are analysed, regulated and mitigated are described.},

Title = {Impact of time pressure on dentists' diagnostic performance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF DENTISTRY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {82},
Pages = {38-44},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Objectives: Although stress is prevalent amongst dentists, there is a
   paucity of data on the impact of stressors on dentists' clinical
   performance. To address this gap in the literature, the aim of the
   present study was to explore the role of time pressure, representing one
   common stressor, on dentists' radiographic diagnostic performance.
   Methods: Forty dentists were randomised to examine and provide a
   radiographic report on two sets of radiographs (six bitewings in each
   set) under two conditions on a cross-over basis: time-pressure vs.
   no-time-pressure. The radiographic report of an experienced consultant
   was considered the gold standard against which participants diagnostic
   decisions were compared to calculate sensitivity and specificity.
   Participants rated their stress after each experimental condition using
   a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS).
   Results: The VAS scores for stress were significantly higher in the time
   pressure condition vs. no time pressure condition (mean: 55.78 versus
   10.73, p < 0.0001), indicating that the time pressure acted as a source
   of stress. Dentists' diagnostic performance was affected; the
   sensitivity was significantly lower under time pressure (median: 0.50
   versus 0.80, p < 0.0001), but by contrast, the median diagnostic
   specificity was 1.00 under both conditions.
   Conclusions: Time pressure negatively impacts one aspect of dentists'
   diagnostic performance, namely sensitivity (increased diagnostic errors
   and omissions of pathology), which can potentially affect patient safety
   and the quality of care delivered. However, time pressure was found to
   have less influence on diagnostic specificity.
   Clinical Significance: The present study demonstrated a significant
   deterioration of dentists' diagnostic performance (sensitivity) under
   time-pressure when examining bitewing radiographs. Diagnostic errors may
   put patient safety at risk, with patients potentially being harmed if
   pathology is missed. Such errors can have medicolegal implications on
   the dentists' practice.},

Abstract = {Background Low adherence to statin (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors)
   medication is common. Here, we report on the design and implementation
   of the Habit Formation trial. This clinical trial assessed whether the
   interventions, based on principles from behavioral economics, might
   improve statin adherence and lipid control in at-risk populations. We
   describe the rationale and methods for the trial, recruitment, conduct
   and follow-up. We also report on several barriers we encountered with
   recruitment and conduct of the trial, solutions we devised and efforts
   we will make to assess their impact on our study. Methods Habit
   Formation is a four-arm randomized controlled trial. Recruitment of 805
   participants at elevated risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
   with evidence of sub-optimal statin adherence and low-density
   lipoprotein (LDL) control is complete. Initially, we recruited from
   large employers (Employers) and a national health insurance company
   (Insurers) using mailed letters; individuals with a statin Medication
   Possession Ratio less than 80\% were invited to participate. Respondents
   were enrolled if a laboratory measurement of low-density lipoprotein was
   >130 mg/dL. Subsequently, we recruited participants from the Penn
   Medicine Health System; individuals with usual-care low-density
   lipoprotein of >100 mg/dL in the electronic medical record were
   recruited using phone, text, email, and regular mail. Eligible
   participants self-reported incomplete medication adherence. During a
   6-month intervention period, all participants received a
   wireless-enabled pill bottle for their statins and daily reminder
   messages to take their medication. Principles of behavioral economics
   were used to design three financial incentives, specifically a Simple
   Daily Sweepstakes rewarding daily medication adherence, a Deadline
   Sweepstakes where participants received either a full or reduced
   incentive depending on whether they took their medication before or
   after a daily reminder or Sweepstakes Plus Deposit Contract with
   incentives divided between daily sweepstakes and a monthly deposit. Six
   months post-incentives, we compared the primary outcome, mean change
   from baseline low-density lipoprotein, across arms. Results and lessons
   learned Health system recruitment yielded substantially better
   enrollment and was cost-efficient. Despite unexpected systematic failure
   and/or poor availability of two wireless pill bottles, we achieved
   enrollment targets and implemented the interventions. For new trials, we
   will routinely monitor device function and have contingency plans in the
   event of systemic failure. Conclusion Interventions used in the Habit
   Formation trial could be translated into clinical practice. Within a
   large health system, successful recruitment depended on identification
   of eligible individuals through their electronic medical record, along
   with flexible ways of contacting these individuals. Challenges with
   device failure were manageable. The study will add to our understanding
   of optimally structuring and implementing incentives to motivate durable
   behavior change.},

   in the utilization of SERS through the successful fabrication of novel
   nanostructured materials. Various bottom-up and top-down approaches have
   demonstrated their potential in improving sensitivity, while many
   applications exploit the immobilization of recognition elements and
   molecular imprinted polymers (MIPs) to enhance specificity and
   reproducibility in complex matrices. Therefore, the design and
   fabrication of nanomaterials is of utmost importance and are presented
   herein. This paper uncovers that limited studies establish detection
   limits or conduct validation using naturally contaminated samples. One
   decade on, SERS is still lacking significant progress and there is a
   disconnect between the technology, the European regulatory limits, and
   the intended end-user. Ongoing challenges and potential solutions are
   discussed including nanofabrication, molecular binders, and data
   analytics. Recommendations to assay design, portability, and substrate
   stability are made to help improve the potential and feasibility of SERS
   for future on-site agri-food applications.
   A comprehensive review of nanomaterial fabrication techniques including,
   the bottom-up synthesis of metallic, core-shell and magnetic
   nanoparticles and top-down approaches including, lithographic,
   nonlithographic, and two-dimensional (2D) materials: MXenes and graphene
   are presented for the surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)-based
   detection of mycotoxins in food and feed, with an emphasis on current
   challenges and future prospects. image},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The last decade has seen improved outcomes for children
   requiring extracorporeal life support as well as for children undergoing
   hematopoietic cell transplantation. Thus, given the historically poor
   survival of hematopoietic cell transplantation patients using
   extracorporeal life support, the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis
   Investigators' hematopoietic cell transplantation and cancer
   immunotherapy subgroup aimed to characterize the utility of
   extracorporeal life support in facilitating recovery from critical
   cardiorespiratory illnesses in pediatric hematopoietic cell
   transplantation patients. DATA SOURCES: All available published data
   were identified using a set of PubMed search terms for pediatric
   extracorporeal life support and hematopoietic cell transplantation.
   STUDY SELECTION: All articles that provided original reports of
   pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation patients who underwent
   extracorporeal life support were included. Sixty-four manuscripts met
   search criteria. Twenty-four were included as primary reports of
   pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation patients who underwent
   extracorporeal life support (11 were single case reports, four single
   institution case series, two multi-institution case series, and seven
   registry reports from Extracorporeal Life Support Organization,
   Pediatric Heath Information System, and Virtual Pediatric Systems). DATA
   EXTRACTION: All 24 articles were reviewed by first and last authors and
   a spread sheet was constructed including sample size, potential biases,
   and conclusions. DATA SYNTHESIS: Discussions regarding incorporation of
   available evidence into our clinical practice were held at biannual
   meetings, as well as through email and virtual meetings. An expert
   consensus was determined through these discussions and confirmed through
   a modified Delphi process. CONCLUSIONS: Extracorporeal life support in
   hematopoietic cell transplantation patients is being used with
   increasing frequency and potentially improving survival. The Pediatric
   Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis Investigators hematopoietic cell
   transplantation-cancer immunotherapy subgroup has developed a framework
   to guide physicians in decision-making surrounding extracorporeal life
   support candidacy in pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation
   patients. In addition to standard extracorporeal life support
   considerations, candidacy in the hematopoietic cell transplantation
   population should consider the following six factors in order of
   consensus agreement: 1) patient comorbidities; 2) underlying disease
   necessitating hematopoietic cell transplantation; 3) hematopoietic cell
   transplantation toxicities, 4) family and patient desires for goals of
   care; 5) hematopoietic cell transplantation preparatory regimen; and 6)
   graft characteristics. Although risk assessment may be individualized,
   data are currently insufficient to clearly delineate ideal candidacy.
   Therefore, we urge the onco-critical care community to collaborate and
   capture data to provide better evidence to guide physicians'
   decision-making in the future.},

Abstract = {Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is the key technology to
   realize self-localization of autonomous vehicles. However, the lidar
   SLAM with traditional loop closure detection cannot obtain reliable
   accuracy and real-time under large scale scene due to the accumulated
   error of point cloud registration. In this paper, a hybrid loop closure
   detection (HLCD) method based on spatial location and appearance
   similarity is proposed and introduced into lidar SLAM technology. An
   experimental test is implemented on the platform of autonomous vehicle
   to verify the correctness and feasibility of theoretical design.
   Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively
   reduce the cumulative deviation and time consuming.},

Title = {The Effect of Health Information Technology on Health Care Provider
   Communication: A Mixed-Method Protocol},
Journal = {JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Communication failures between physicians and nurses are one
   of the most common causes of adverse events for hospitalized patients,
   as well as a major root cause of all sentinel events. Communication
   technology (ie, the electronic medical record, computerized provider
   order entry, email, and pagers), which is a component of health
   information technology (HIT), may help reduce some communication
   failures but increase others because of an inadequate understanding of
   how communication technology is used. Increasing use of health
   information and communication technologies is likely to affect
   communication between nurses and physicians.
   Objective: The purpose of this study is to describe, in detail, how
   health information and communication technologies facilitate or hinder
   communication between nurses and physicians with the ultimate goal of
   identifying how we can optimize the use of these technologies to support
   effective communication. Effective communication is the process of
   developing shared understanding between communicators by establishing,
   testing, and maintaining relationships. Our theoretical model, based in
   communication and sociology theories, describes how health information
   and communication technologies affect communication through
   communication practices (ie, use of rich media; the location and
   availability of computers) and work relationships (ie, hierarchies and
   team stability). Therefore we seek to (1) identify the range of health
   information and communication technologies used in a national sample of
   medical-surgical acute care units, (2) describe communication practices
   and work relationships that may be influenced by health information and
   communication technologies in these same settings, and (3) explore how
   differences in health information and communication technologies,
   communication practices, and work relationships between physicians and
   nurses influence communication.
   Methods: This 4-year study uses a sequential mixed-methods design,
   beginning with a quantitative survey followed by a two-part qualitative
   phase. Survey results from aim 1 will provide a detailed assessment of
   health information and communication technologies in use and help
   identify sites with variation in health information and communication
   technologies for the qualitative phase of the study. In aim 2, we will
   conduct telephone interviews with hospital personnel in up to 8
   hospitals to gather in-depth information about communication practices
   and work relationships on medical-surgical units. In aim 3, we will
   collect data in 4 hospitals (selected from telephone interview results)
   via observation, shadowing, focus groups, and artifacts to learn how
   health information and communication technologies, communication
   practices, and work relationships affect communication.
   Results: Results from aim 1 will be published in 2016. Results from aims
   2 and 3 will be published in subsequent years.
   Conclusions: As the majority of US hospitals do not yet have HIT fully
   implemented, results from our study will inform future development and
   implementation of health information and communication technologies to
   support effective communication between nurses and physicians.},

Abstract = {Background
   Preventive health care promotes health and prevents disease or injuries
   by addressing factors that lead to the onset of a disease, and by
   detecting latent conditions to reduce or halt their progression. Many
   risk factors for costly and disabling conditions (such as cardiovascular
   diseases, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases) can be
   prevented, yet healthcare systems do not make the best use of their
   available resources to support this process. Mobile phone messaging
   applications, such as Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia Message
   Service (MMS), could offer a convenient and cost-effective way to
   support desirable health behaviours for preventive health care.
   Objectives
   To assess the effects of mobile phone messaging interventions as a mode
   of delivery for preventive health care, on health status and health
   behaviour outcomes.
   Search methods
   We searched: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
   (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (January
   1993 to June 2009), EMBASE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009),
   PsycINFO (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), CINAHL (EbscoHOST)
   (January 1993 to June 2009), LILACS (January 1993 to June 2009) and
   African Health Anthology (January 1993 to June 2009).
   We also reviewed grey literature (including trial registers) and
   reference lists of articles.
   Selection criteria
   We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised
   controlled trials (QRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, and
   interrupted time series (ITS) studies with at least three time points
   before and after the intervention. We included studies using SMS or MMS
   as a mode of delivery for any type of preventive health care. We only
   included studies in which it was possible to assess the effects of
   mobile phone messaging independent of other technologies or
   interventions.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently assessed all studies against the
   inclusion criteria, with any disagreements resolved by a third review
   author. Study design features, characteristics of target populations,
   interventions and controls, and results data were extracted by two
   review authors and confirmed by a third author. Primary outcomes of
   interest were health status and health behaviour outcomes. We also
   considered patients' and providers' evaluation of the intervention,
   perceptions of safety, health service utilisation and costs, and
   potential harms or adverse effects. Because the included studies were
   heterogeneous in type of condition addressed, intervention
   characteristics and outcome measures, we did not consider that it was
   justified to conduct a meta-analysis to derive an overall effect size
   for the main outcome categories; instead, we present findings
   narratively.
   Main results
   We included four randomised controlled trials involving 1933
   participants.
   For the primary outcome category of health, there was moderate quality
   evidence from one study that women who received prenatal support via
   mobile phone messages had significantly higher satisfaction than those
   who did not receive the messages, both in the antenatal period (mean
   difference (MD) 1.25, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.72) and
   perinatal period (MD 1.19, 95\% CI 0.37 to 2.01). Their confidence level
   was also higher (MD 1.12, 95\% CI 0.51 to 1.73) and anxiety level was
   lower (MD -2.15, 95\% CI -3.42 to -0.88) than in the control group in
   the antenatal period. In this study, no further differences were
   observed between groups in the perinatal period. There was low quality
   evidence that the mobile phone messaging intervention did not affect
   pregnancy outcomes (gestational age at birth, infant birth weight,
   preterm delivery and route of delivery).
   For the primary outcome category of health behaviour, there was moderate
   quality evidence from one study that mobile phone message reminders to
   take vitamin C for preventive reasons resulted in higher adherence (risk
   ratio (RR) 1.41, 95\% CI 1.14 to 1.74). There was high quality evidence
   from another study that participants receiving mobile phone messaging
   support had a significantly higher likelihood of quitting smoking than
   those in a control group at 6 weeks (RR 2.20, 95\% CI 1.79 to 2.70) and
   at 12 weeks follow-up (RR 1.55, 95\% CI 1.30 to 1.84). At 26 weeks,
   there was only a significant difference between groups if, for
   participants with missing data, the last known value was carried
   forward. There was very low quality evidence from one study that mobile
   phone messaging interventions for self-monitoring of healthy behaviours
   related to childhood weight control did not have a statistically
   significant effect on physical activity, consumption of sugar-sweetened
   beverages or screen time.
   For the secondary outcome of acceptability, there was very low quality
   evidence from one study that user evaluation of the intervention was
   similar between groups. There was moderate quality evidence from one
   study of no difference in adverse effects of the intervention, measured
   as rates of pain in the thumb or finger joints, and car crash rates.
   None of the studies reported the secondary outcomes of health service
   utilisation or costs of the intervention.
   Authors' conclusions
   We found very limited evidence that in certain cases mobile phone
   messaging interventions may support preventive health care, to improve
   health status and health behaviour outcomes. However, because of the low
   number of participants in three of the included studies, combined with
   study limitations of risk of bias and lack of demonstrated causality,
   the evidence for these effects is of low to moderate quality. The
   evidence is of high quality only for interventions aimed at smoking
   cessation. Furthermore, there are significant information gaps regarding
   the long-term effects, risks and limitations of, and user satisfaction
   with, such interventions.},

Title = {Dirt Cheap and Without Prescription: How Susceptible are Young US
   Consumers to Purchasing Drugs From Rogue Internet Pharmacies?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR-JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Websites of many rogue sellers of medications are accessible
   through links in email spam messages or via web search engines. This
   study examined how well students enrolled in a U.S. higher education
   institution could identify clearly unsafe pharmacies.
   Objective: The aim is to estimate these health consumers' vulnerability
   to fraud by illegitimate Internet pharmacies.
   Methods: Two Internet pharmacy websites, created specifically for this
   study, displayed multiple untrustworthy features modeled after five
   actual Internet drug sellers which the authors considered to be
   potentially dangerous to consumers. The websites had none of the safe
   pharmacy signs and nearly all of the danger signs specified in the Food
   and Drug Administration's (FDA's) guide to consumers. Participants were
   told that a neighborhood pharmacy charged US\$165 for a one-month supply
   of Beozine, a bogus drug to ensure no pre-existing knowledge. After
   checking its price at two Internet pharmacies-\$37.99 in pharmacy A and
   \$57.60 in pharmacy B-the respondents were asked to indicate if each
   seller was a good place to buy the drug. Responses came from 1,914
   undergraduate students who completed an online eHealth literacy
   assessment in 2005-2008. Participation rate was 78\%.
   Results: In response to ``On a scale from 0-10, how good is this
   pharmacy as a place for buying Beozine?{''} many respondents gave
   favorable ratings. Specifically, 50\% of students who reviewed pharmacy
   A and 37\% of students who reviewed pharmacy B chose a rating above the
   scale midpoint. When explaining a low drug cost, these raters related it
   to low operation costs, ad revenue, pressure to lower costs due to
   comparison shopping, and/or high sales volume. Those who said that
   pharmacy A or B was ``a very bad place{''} for purchasing the drug
   (25\%), as defined by a score of I or less, related low drug cost to
   lack of regulation, low drug quality, and/or customer information sales.
   About 16\% of students thought that people should be advised to buy
   cheaper drugs at pharmacies such as these but the majority (62\%)
   suggested that people should be warned against buying drugs from such
   internet sellers. Over 22\% of respondents would recommend pharmacy A to
   friends and family (10\% pharmacy B). One-third of participants supplied
   online health information to others for decision-making purposes. After
   controlling for the effects of education, health major, and age, these
   respondents had significantly worse judgment of Internet pharmacies than
   those who did not act as information suppliers.
   Conclusions: At least a quarter of students, including those in health
   programs, cannot see multiple signs of danger displayed by rogue
   Internet pharmacies. Many more are likely to be misled by online sellers
   that use professional design, veil untrustworthy features, and mimic
   reputable websites. Online health information consumers would benefit
   from education initiatives that (1) communicate why it can be dangerous
   to buy medications online and that (2) develop their information
   evaluation skills. This study highlights the importance of regulating
   rogue Internet pharmacies and curbing the danger they pose to consumers.},

Abstract = {A new dataset of cosmetics-related chemicals for the Threshold of
   Toxicological Concern (TTC) approach has been compiled, comprising 552
   chemicals with 219, 40, and 293 chemicals in Cramer Classes I, II, and
   III, respectively. Data were integrated and curated to create a database
   of No-/Lowest-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (NOAEL/LOAEL) values, from
   which the final COSMOS TTC dataset was developed. Criteria for study
   inclusion and NOAEL decisions were defined, and rigorous quality control
   was performed for study details and assignment of Cramer classes. From
   the final COSMOS TTC dataset, human exposure thresholds of 42 and 7.9 mu
   g/kg-bw/day were derived for Cramer Classes I and III, respectively. The
   size of Cramer Class II was insufficient for derivation of a TTC value.
   The COSMOS TTC dataset was then federated with the dataset of Munro and
   colleagues, previously published in 1996, after updating the latter
   using the quality control processes for this project. This federated
   dataset expands the chemical space and provides more robust thresholds.
   The 966 substances in the federated database comprise 245, 49 and 672
   chemicals in Cramer Classes I, II and III, respectively. The
   corresponding TTC values of 46, 6.2 and 23 mu g/kg-bw/day are broadly
   similar to those of the original Munro dataset. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Abstract = {LIDAR SLAM technology is an important way for accurate navigation of
   automatic vehicles, and it is also a prerequisite for the safe driving
   of automatic vehicles in the unstructured road environment of complex
   parks. This paper proposes a new Lidar fast point cloud registration
   algorithm that can realize fast and accurate localization and mapping of
   automatic vehicle point clouds through combination of Normal
   Distribution Transform (NDT) and Point-to-Line Iterative Closest Point
   (PLICP). First, the NDT point cloud registration algorithm is applied
   for rough registration of point clouds between adjacent frames, to
   achieve a rough estimate of the pose of automatic vehicles. Then, the
   PLICP point cloud registration algorithm is adopted to correct the rough
   registration result of point cloud. This step completes the precise
   registration of the point cloud and will achieve an accurate estimate of
   the pose of the automatic vehicle. Finally, the cloud registration is
   accumulated over time, and the point cloud information is continuously
   updated to complete the construction of the point cloud map.},

Title = {The British Army's Training in International Humanitarian Law},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONFLICT \& SECURITY LAW},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {2},
Pages = {291-315},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {States must disseminate international humanitarian law (IHL) and
   integrate it into military instruction. Implementation of the IHL
   training obligation was delayed in the UK; when the government asserted
   that IHL was inapplicable to colonial warfare, resisted the development
   of the IHL of non-international armed conflict, and was keen to maintain
   the nuclear deterrent. Absent or perfunctory IHL training correlated
   with recurrent violations of the prohibitions of torture and inhuman
   treatment, from the 1950s to the 2000s. Despite official assertions that
   the British Army's training in IHL was being reformed following the
   death of Baha Mousa in British military custody in 2003, there were
   gradual changes from 2004 to 2011, and more thorough improvements from
   2012 to 2017. Training materials for soldiers and officers now offer
   breadth and detail on IHL, with elements of international human rights
   law. They implement the 71 recommendations in the Baha Mousa Public
   Inquiry Report which the Ministry of Defence accepted, and are
   supplemented by practical training. Yet these are reactive reforms,
   which still lack norm-by-norm evaluation of soldiers' understanding.
   Prohibitions on humiliating or degrading treatment of a sexual nature,
   and on the intentional infliction of severe mental pain and suffering
   are (respectively) under-emphasised and absent. References to the
   necessity of restraint positions (as opposed to the prohibited stress
   positions) may cause confusion. There is a simplistic suggestion that
   reprisals are lawful if they are politically authorised. Training
   reforms have been cited as one reason to close criminal investigations
   into alleged war crimes: a response which neglects coexistent
   investigatory obligations.},

Abstract = {I examine whether lack of an individual market for prescription drug
   insurance causes individuals to delay retirement. Exploiting the 2006
   introduction of Medicare Part D, which subsidized drug insurance for
   Americans over age 65, I use a triple-differences design that compares
   labor outcomes of individuals with retiree health insurance up to age 65
   to those with insurance for life, before and after age 65, before and
   after 2006.I find that those with benefits only to age 65 decreased
   full-time work by 8.4 percentage points, of which 70 percent was due to
   transitions to part-time work.},

Title = {The Question of 2047: Constitutional Fate of ``One Country, Two
   Systems{''} in Hong Kong},
Journal = {GERMAN LAW JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {21},
Number = {8},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The history of Hong Kong is intertwined with British colonialism and
   China's Hong Kong policies. This history offers unique and important
   lessons on the rise and fall of Hong Kong's constitutional order. In
   accordance with the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, China declares
   12 basic policies regarding Hong Kong and has translated these into the
   1990 Hong Kong Basic Law. It is generally held that ``One Country, Two
   Systems{''} will be the main constitutional architecture of Hong Kong
   for 50 years, and it will remain basically unchanged even after 2047.
   However, there are obvious difficulties and enormous differences on the
   interpretation of Article 5 of the Hong Kong Basic Law concerning the
   true meaning of ``unchanged for 50 years.{''} Recent years have
   witnessed the great need for deciphering the time-code of the Basic Law
   because the question of 2047 draws closer and closer to the central
   stage for the determination of Hong Kong's constitutional future. This
   Article aims to provide legal analysis on Article 5 of Hong Kong Basic
   Law and the constitutional fate of Hong Kong toward 2047. It
   distinguishes all sorts of Article 5 interpretations into three broad
   categories: ``Unchanged for 50 years{''} as international promise,
   ``unchanged for 50 years{''} as political commitment, and ``unchanged
   for 50 years{''} as constitutional obligation. Different approaches have
   been utilized for various constitutional interpretations. But all in
   all, the constitutional puzzles regarding ``unchanged for 50 years{''}
   must be addressed within the framework of the temporality of the Basic
   Law in a fast-paced world. In order to maintain the constitutional
   stability and endurance, to secure the unamendability of ``One Country,
   Two Systems{''} in 2047 will be the best blessing for Hong Kong in every
   possible way.},

Title = {Persistence of repeated self-reported illusion of control as a product

Abstract = {Individuals interpret themselves as causal agents when executing an
   action to achieve an outcome, even when action and outcome are
   independent. How can illusion of control be managed? Once established,
   does it decay? This study aimed to analyze the effects of valence,
   probability of the outcome {[}p(O)] and probability of the actions
   performed by the participant {[}p(A)], on the magnitude of judgments of
   control and corresponding associative measures (including
   Rescorla-Wagner's, Probabilistic Contrast, and Cheng's Power
   Probabilistic Contrast models). A traffic light was presented on a
   computer screen to 81 participants who tried to control the green or red
   lights by pressing the spacebar, after instructions describing a
   productive or a preventive scenario. There were 4 blocks of 50 trials
   under all of 4 different p(O)s in random order (0.10, 0.30, 0.70, and
   0.90). Judgments were assessed in a bidimensional scale. The 2 x 4 x 4
   mixed experimental design was analyzed through General Linear Models,
   including factor group (between-subject valence), and block and p(O)
   (within subjects). There was a small effect of group and a large and
   direct effect of p(O) on judgments. Illusion was reported by 66\% of the
   sample and was positive in the productive group. The oscillation of p(O)
   produced stronger illusions; decreasing p(O)s produced nil or negative
   illusions. Only Rescorla-Wagner's could model causality properly. The
   reasons why p(A) and the other models could not generate significant
   results are discussed. The results help to comprehend the importance of
   keeping moderate illusions in productive and preventive scenarios.},

Abstract = {EU and US political leaders and elites share the same overall threat
   assessment of terrorist networks but differ over the choice of strategy
   to defeat them. While President Bush's ``war on terrorism'' has relied
   on the military to suppress terrorism, incarcerating terrorist suspects
   in Guantanamo and refusing them access to US federal courts, Europeans
   have stressed a holistic and multilateral approach to the struggle,
   giving a greater role to the criminal justice system. Abandoning due
   process and violating suspects' human rights betrays the very values and
   principles upon which the democracies supposedly being defended are
   founded. Courts in Europe since 9/11 have demonstrated that it is
   possible to bring terrorists and conspirators to trial and to convict
   them on the basis of overwhelming evidence. Hence, the strengthening of
   national judicial processes and international judicial cooperation
   should remain the major objective of the transatlantic alliance.},

Abstract = {Determining the location, design, and construction method for orepasses
   in underground mining operations can be challenging. Existing studies
   and literature contribute useful content but stop short of offering

   obtained information regarding orepass design, construction, and
   planning. Responses are compared to industry best practices and case
   studies found in the available literature. Topics covered in this
   article include construction methods, orepass dimensions, guarding,
   mechanical support, causes of hang-ups, corporate policies on placement,
   and geotechnical factors, among others. The survey responses provide
   valuable insights into the current state of orepass practices and the

Title = {Estimation of Spatial Gradients and Temporal Variations of the Total

Year = {2019},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Precision and safety of life applications of Global Navigation Satellite
   Systems require key information on space weather conditions in
   particular on the perturbation degree of the ionosphere. Such systems
   are particularly vulnerable against severe spatial gradients and rapid
   changes of the total electron content (TEC) measured along different
   satellite-receiver links. To estimate spatial gradients and rapid
   temporal variations of ionospheric TEC, two approaches are discussed.
   The Gradient Ionosphere indeX (GIX) and the Sudden Ionospheric
   Disturbance indeX are able to estimate the perturbation degree of the
   ionosphere instantaneously without taking into account previous
   measurements. The capabilities and accuracy of the index approaches are
   demonstrated by simulations using a 3-D electron density model of the
   ionosphere and plasmasphere in conjunction with realistic Global
   Navigation Satellite Signal constellations. Real data tests confirm the
   applicability of GIX and the related standard deviation GIX Sigma to
   monitor spatial gradients. Sudden Ionospheric Disturbance indeX is able
   to monitor rapid temporal variations of TEC as exemplified by using
   Global Navigation Satellite Signal measurements carried out during solar
   flare events. Both approaches could identify enhanced space weather
   impacts on precise point positioning and the European Geostationary
   Navigation Overlay Service. More comprehensive studies analyzing
   ionospheric storms in close dialogue with potential customers are needed
   to fully utilize the potential of these approaches to serve as objective
   ionospheric indices for scaling horizontal TEC gradients and rapid TEC
   variations in space weather services.
   Plain Language Summary Modern telecommunication and navigation systems
   may be heavily disturbed by charged particles of the Earth's ionosphere
   like electrons and ions. These important technological systems may fail
   due to degradation or even loss of signals during severe perturbations
   of the ionospheric plasma initiated by severe space weather events. In
   this paper two methods are described which provide instantaneous
   information on the perturbation degree of the ionosphere after analyzing
   continuously transmitted signals from Global Navigation Satellite
   Signals (GNSS). The data are available via numerous national and
   international GNSS receiver networks and serve to derive the Total
   Electron Content of the ionosphere. Using this quantity, spatial
   gradients and rapid temporal variations of ionospheric Total Electron
   Content can be estimated in two different approaches over a predefined
   region. The Gradient Ionosphere indeX and the Sudden Ionospheric
   Disturbance indeX are able to characterize the spatial and temporal
   perturbation degree of the ionosphere instantaneously without taking
   into account previous measurements. The applicability of these indices
   has been simulated and tested by using GNSS data obtained over Europe.
   The proposed indices which could easily be distributed via space weather
   services should be well suited to reducing safety and accuracy risks in
   GNSS navigation and positioning.},

Abstract = {Working parents must arrange some type of care for their young children
   when they are away at work. For parents with unstable and unpredictable
   work schedules, the logistics of arranging care can be complex. In this
   paper, we use survey data from the Shift Project, collected in 2017 and
   2018 from a sample of 3,653 parents who balance work in the retail and
   food service sector with parenting young children from infants to nine
   years of age. Our results demonstrate that unstable and unpredictable
   work schedules have consequences for children's care arrangements. We
   find that parents' exposure to on-call work and last-minute shift
   changes are associated with more numerous care arrangements, with a
   reliance on informal care arrangements, with the use of siblings to
   provide care, and with young children being left alone without adult
   supervision. Given the well-established relationship between quality of
   care in the early years and child development, just-in-time scheduling
   practices are likely to have consequences for children's development and
   safety and to contribute to the intergenerational transmission of
   disadvantage.},

Title = {The STOP COVID 2 Study: Fluvoxamine vs Placebo for Outpatients With

Journal = {OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},

Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Background. Prior randomized clinical trials have reported benefit of
   fluvoxamine >= 200 mg/d vs placebo for patients infected with severe
   acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
   Methods. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fully remote
   multisite clinical trial evaluated whether fluvoxamine prevents clinical
   deterioration in higher-risk outpatients with acute coronavirus disease
   2019 (COVID-19). Between December 2020 and May 2021, nonhospitalized US
   and Canadian participants with confirmed symptomatic infection received
   fluvoxamine (50 mg on day 1, 100 mg twice daily thereafter) or placebo
   for 15 days. The primary modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population
   included participants who started the intervention within 7 days of
   symptom onset with a baseline oxygen saturation >= 92\%. The primary
   outcome was clinical deterioration within 15 days of randomization,
   defined as having both (1) shortness of breath (severity >= 4 on a 0-10
   scale or requiring hospitalization) and (2) oxygen saturation <92\% on
   room air or need for supplemental oxygen.
   Results. A total of 547 participants were randomized and met mITT
   criteria (n = 272 fluvoxamine, n = 275 placebo). The Data Safety
   Monitoring Board recommended stopping early for futility related to
   lower-than-predicted event rates and declining accrual concurrent with
   vaccine availability in the United States and Canada. Clinical
   deterioration occurred in 13 (4.8\%) participants in the fluvoxamine
   group and 15 (5.5\%) participants in the placebo group (absolute
   difference at day 15, 0.68\%; 95\% CI, -3.0\% to 4.4\%; log-rank P
   =.91).
   Conclusions. This trial did not find fluvoxamine efficacious in
   preventing clinical deterioration in unvaccinated outpatients with
   symptomatic COVID-19. It was stopped early and underpowered due to low
   primary outcome rates.},

Title = {Systematic Review on N-3 and N-6 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Intake in

Journal = {ANNALS OF NUTRITION AND METABOLISM},
Year = {2017},

Pages = {39-50},
Abstract = {Background: Earlier reviews indicated that in many countries adults,
   children and adolescents consume on an average less polyunsaturated
   fatty acids (PUFAs) than recommended by the Food and Agriculture
   Organisation/World Health Organisation. Summary: The intake of total and
   individual n-3 and n-6 PUFAs in European infants, children, adolescents,
   elderly and pregnant/lactating women was evaluated systematically.
   Results: The evaluations were done against recommendations of the
   European Food Safety Authority. Key Messages: Fifty-three studies from
   17 different European countries reported an intake of total n-3 and n-6
   PUFAs and/or individual n-3 or n-6 PUFAs in at least one of the specific
   population groups: 10 in pregnant women, 4 in lactating women, 3 in
   infants 6-12 months, 6 in children 1-3 years, 11 in children 4-9 years,
   8 in adolescents 10-18 years and 11 in elderly >65 years. Mean linoleic
   acid intake was within the recommendation (4 energy percentage {[}E\%])
   in 52\% of the countries, with inadequate intakes more likely in
   lactating women, adolescents and elderly. Mean alpha-linolenic acid
   intake was within the recommendation (0.5 E\%) in 77\% of the countries.
   In 26\% of the countries, mean eicosapentaenoic acid and/or
   docosahexaenoic acid intake was as recommended. These results indicate
   that intake of n-3 and n-6 PUFAs may be suboptimal in specific
   population groups in Europe. (C) 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel},

Abstract = {The resettlement of herders in pastoral zones is often criticized for
   hindering pastoral mobility, which is essential to survival. We
   integrate narratives of conflict and environmental change with maps to
   demonstrate the complementarity between pastoral mobility - porous
   borders - and border demarcation - rigid borders. We use evidence from
   the Sondre-Est Pastoral Zone in southern Burkina Faso, where herders
   were voluntarily resettled near agricultural villages following the
   droughts of the 1970s. Over time, however, farmers encroached on the
   borders of the pastoral zone and surrounding grazing areas declined.
   This increased landuse disputes. Tensions were exacerbated by the fact
   that these communities kept maps as community secrets. We re-created the
   administrative boundaries of the pastoral zone to map
   land-use/land-cover changes and conflict hot spots. The maps show that
   conflicts happened along porous borders where agricultural fields
   encroached. Herders called for a clear demarcation of the border of the
   pastoral zone to preserve exclusive access to resources within it.
   Simultaneously, they also wanted to maintain shared access to other
   resources outside the pastoral zone. The herders' desire for both border
   clarity and some form of flexibility underlines the complementary
   between both processes, especially in times of resource scarcity and
   land-use conflict. The mystery around the maps helps sustain ambiguity
   that is key for pursuing both goals.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {25},
Pages = {402-425},
Abstract = {This article reviews recent literature on the political ecologies of
   conservation and environmental change mitigation, highlighting the
   biopolitical stakes of many writings in this field. Although a large and
   apparently growing number of political ecologists engage the concept of
   biopower directly - in its Foucauldian, Agambenian, and various other
   formulations - recent writings across the humanities and social sciences
   by scholars utilizing an explicitly biopolitical lens provide us with an
   array of concepts and research questions that may further enrich
   writings within political ecology. Seeking to extend dialogue between
   scholars of biopolitics, of political ecology, and of both, then, this
   article surveys both new and shifting contours of the various ways in
   which contemporary political ecologies increasingly compel us to bring
   the very lives of various human and nonhuman populations, as Foucault
   once put it, ``into the realm of explicit calculations.{''} In doing so,
   `new frontiers' of biopolitical inquiry are examined related to: i)
   species, varieties, or `multiple modes' of governmentality and biopower;
   ii) critical (ecosystem) infrastructure, risk, and `reflexive'
   biopolitics; iii) environmental history, colonialism, and the
   genealogies of biopower, and iv) the proliferation of related
   neologisms, such as ontopower and geontopower.},

Abstract = {This article analyses forced migrants' perceptions of ``protection{''},
   coined here as ``protection consciousness{''}. The article is built
   around the voices and lived experiences of Congolese forced migrants in
   the Moroccan capital and asks: which aspirations mobilise them?; what
   does ``protection{''} mean for them?; and do they find it in the law, or
   elsewhere? Fieldwork data was obtained through observations and 15
   interviews with Congolese migrants with self-assessed protection needs
   in Rabat in 2019. A socio-legal analysis of the data leads to three main
   findings. First, once they are in Morocco, Congolese forced migrants
   aspire material subsistence and work rather than ``protection{''}, and
   do so irrespective of the original reason that forced them to leave the
   DRC. Second, they understand and experience ``protection{''} not as a
   strictly legal concept, but as physical safety, freedom of movement and
   spiritual and religious comfort. Third, they feel alienated from State
   law, conceive it as protection-inhibiting rather than
   protection-enhancing, and prefer to rely on more informal normative and
   social orders instead.},

Title = {South Korea's Global Health Outreach through Official Development
   Assistance: Analysis of Aid Activities of South Korea's Leading Aid

Abstract = {Although South Korea is one of the newest members to join the
   Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Development
   Assistance Committee in 2010, it has a long history of official
   development assistance (ODA), first as a recipient of aid (1945-1995)
   and later as an emerging donor (with the establishment of
   aid-implementing agencies for concessional loans in 1987, and for grant
   aid in 1991, respectively). And, global public health has been one of
   the three largest outreach areas of South Korea's foreign aid
   programmes. This article examines the global public health outreach
   activities of South Korea's leading aid-implementing agencies, namely
   Korea International Cooperation Agency, Korea Foundation for
   International Healthcare and Economic Development and Cooperation Fund,
   using data for the latest period, 2008-2012. South Korea's innovative
   global public health ODA through the Global Poverty Eradication
   Contribution is also examined. The analysis of global public health
   outreach activities has shown that South Korea has concentrated its
   foreign aid to Asia and Africa, and that a large share of its aid has
   been focused on health care services; water, sanitation and hygiene
   (WASH); maternal and child health (MCH); and infectious diseases. A
   significant regional difference was found: South Korea's aid focused on
   health care services and MCH in Asia, while it focused on WASH and
   infectious diseases in Africa. Findings have also shown that South
   Korea's priority countries for development cooperation have received
   more aid compared with non-priority countries. In conclusion, we have
   found that South Korea's global health outreach activities were in line
   with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), but that they lack a clear
   focus and do not have globally recognised initiatives or projects
   compared with large and traditional donors such as the United States and
   Japan. Further research is needed to examine the impact of the rapidly
   rising aid activities of South Korea, especially in global public
   health.},

Abstract = {Ambulation in everyday life requires walking at variable speeds,
   variable inclines, and variable terrains. Powered prostheses aim to
   provide this adaptability through control of the actuated joints. Some
   powered prosthesis controllers can adapt to discrete changes in speed
   and incline but require manual tuning to determine the control
   parameters, leading to poor clinical viability. Other data-driven
   controllers can continuously adapt to changes in speed and incline but
   do so by imposing the same non-amputee gait patterns for all amputee
   subjects, which does not consider subjective preferences and differing
   clinical needs of users. Here, we present a controller for powered knee
   and ankle prostheses that can continuously adapt to different walking
   speeds, inclines, and uneven terrains without enforcing a specific
   prosthesis position, impedance, or torque. A virtual biarticular muscle
   connection determines the knee flexion torque, which changes with both
   speed and slope. Adaptation to inclines and uneven terrains is based
   solely on the global shank orientation. Continuously variable damping
   allows for speed adaptation. Minimum-jerk programming defines the
   prosthesis swing trajectory at variable cadences. Experiments with one
   individual with an above-knee amputation suggest that the proposed
   controller can effectively adapt to different walking speeds, inclines,
   and rough terrains.},

   reduce provision of uncompensated care in response to reductions in
   Medicaid DSH, but the response was inelastic in value. Policymakers need
   to continue to monitor uncompensated care as sources of support for
   indigent care change with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act

Abstract = {Outbreaks of viral infectious diseases, such as the severe acute
   respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza A virus
   (IAV), pose a great threat to human health. Viral spread is accelerated
   worldwide by the development of cold chain logistics; Therefore, an
   effective antiviral approach is required. In this study, it is aimed to
   develop a distinct antiviral strategy using nanozymes with
   low-temperature adaptability, suitable for cold chain logistics.
   Phosphorus (P) atoms are added to the remote counter position of Fe-N-C
   center to prepare FeN4P2-single-atom nanozymes (SAzymes), exhibiting
   lipid oxidase (OXD)-like activity at cold chain temperatures (-20, and 4
   degrees C). This feature enables FeN4P2-SAzymes to disrupt multiple
   enveloped viruses (human, swine, and avian coronaviruses, and H1-H11
   subtypes of IAV) by catalyzing lipid peroxidation of the viral lipid
   envelope. Under the simulated conditions of cold chain logistics,
   FeN4P2-SAzymes are successfully applied as antiviral coatings on outer
   packaging and personal protective equipment; Therefore, FeN4P2-SAzymes
   with low-temperature adaptability and broad-spectrum antiviral
   properties may serve as key materials for developing specific antiviral
   approaches to interrupt viral transmission through the cold chain.
   This study prepares FeN4P2 single-atom nanozymes (FeN4P2-SAzymes) with
   low-temperature adaptive OXD-like activity at cold chain temperatures
   (4, and -20 degrees C), which efficiently inactivate multiple enveloped
   viruses by catalyzing lipid peroxidation of the viral lipid envelope;
   Additionally, under conditions of cold chain logistics, FeN4P2-SAzymes
   are successfully applied as antiviral coatings on outer packaging and
   personal protective equipment.image},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {This paper studies how employees anticipate change in social relations
   after a strike in their organisation. We hypothesise that two group
   norms affect employees' fear that a strike deteriorates the social
   relations with their colleagues. We distinguish between two different
   norms associated with a collective action problem such as a strike. A
   `solidarity norm' prescribes that workers should participate in
   collective protest when called for. A `free rider punishment norm'
   describes whether and how violators of the solidarity norm should be
   treated. While the former itself theoretically does not impact
   intra-group social relations, the latter one does. We test our
   hypotheses on a data set of 468 Dutch union members. Adherence to the
   free rider punishment norm significantly increases a fear for
   deterioration of social relations with colleagues after a strike, while
   adherence to the solidarity norm does not. We also find a moderating
   effect of expected proportion of strikers. The results are discussed
   with reference to industrial relations theory and mobilisation theory,
   further probing into mechanisms that relate social norms to the
   (anticipated) costs of participation and the quality of social relations
   after a strike.},

Abstract = {What is the relationship between disability programs and financial
   distress? We provide the first evidence on this relationship using
   several markers of financial distress: bankruptcy, foreclosure,
   eviction, and home sale. Rates of these adverse financial events peak
   around the time of disability application. Using variation induced by an
   age-based eligibility rule, we find that disability allowance reduces
   the likelihood of bankruptcy by 20 percent, foreclosure by 33 percent,
   and home sale by 15 percent. We present evidence that these changes
   reflect true reductions in financial distress. Considering these extreme
   events increases the optimal disability benefit amount and suggests a
   shorter optimal waiting time between application and benefit receipt.},

Abstract = {Most countries reduce disability insurance (DI) benefits for
   beneficiaries earning above a specified threshold. Such an earnings
   threshold generates a discontinuous increase in tax liability-a
   notch-and creates an incentive to keep earnings below the threshold.
   Exploiting such a notch in Austria, we provide transparent and credible
   identification of the effect of financial incentives on DI
   beneficiaries' earnings. Using rich administrative data, we document
   large and sharp bunching at the earnings threshold. However, the
   elasticity driving these responses is small. Our estimate suggests that
   relaxing the earnings threshold reduces fiscal cost only if program
   entry is very inelastic.},

Journal = {AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {102},
Number = {3},
Pages = {884-910},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This article models and estimates the efficiency gains from using
   market-based instruments relative to command and control to manage
   groundwater. A theoretical model of an imperfectly competitive
   groundwater market is developed to show how the magnitude and
   distribution of the gains from trade change as market structure varies.
   Market structure is a key consideration because future groundwater
   markets will likely feature geographic limitations to trade, large
   agricultural players, and a legal environment that is conducive to
   forming cartel-like coalitions. Application of the model to a
   groundwater-dependent agricultural region in southern California shows
   the existence of large gains from trade, despite the potential for
   market power, with benefits up to 36\% greater than that under command
   and control. Distributional impacts, however, can be sizable even for
   small degrees of market power. Simulations that vary market conditions
   show that results likely generalize to other groundwater basins.},

Title = {Mortality in adolescents after therapeutic intervention for self-harm: A
   systematic review and meta-analysis},
Journal = {JCPP ADVANCES},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JAN 23},
Abstract = {BackgroundSelf-harm in adolescents is an international concern. Evidence
   highlights that therapeutic intervention (TI), such as cognitive
   behaviour therapy informed treatments, after self-harm leads to reduced
   self-harm repetition. However, there is no prior literature about the
   effects of TI on future mortality in adolescents. We examined the effect
   of TI on mortality rates in adolescents across RCTs.MethodsThis review
   was reported in accordance with PRISMA guidance. MEDLINE, EMBASE,
   PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library were searched to 19 June 2024. Two
   authors independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts against
   pre-defined criteria. RCTs were included if they compared a TI versus a
   comparator in adolescents up to 18 years with at least one prior
   self-harm episode. There was no lower age limit. For the pooled effect
   size of mortality, the DerSimonian-Laird method was used, and a random
   effects model for self-harm and suicide attempts. The primary outcome
   was intra or post-trial mortality in adolescent post TI, and the effect
   of TIs on self-harm including attempted suicide episodes were secondary
   outcomes. Analyses were done in Stata.ResultsTwenty-four trials of TIs
   consisting of 3470 randomised adolescents were included. The pooled risk
   difference for mortality of participants in the TI group was 0.002 (95\%
   CI -0.003 to 0.008, p = 0.42). There were 6 deaths in the TI group
   compared to 15 deaths in the comparator group. The pooled risk
   difference for TI on repeat self-harm was -0.07 (95\% CI -0.132 to
   -0.007, p = 0.028), and -0.05 (95\% CI -0.086 to -0.007, p = 0.022) for
   suicide attempts compared to comparator.ConclusionsThis review found no
   significant impact of TIs on future mortality in adolescents. We also
   demonstrated that TIs can reduce suicide attempts which can lead to
   substantial benefits for adolescents, families, and clinical services.},

Abstract = {Objective To compare the perception towards injury risk reduction
   approach between athletes who have already experienced an injury and
   those who have not.Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study using a
   one-time online survey asking athletics athletes licensed at the French
   Federation of Athletics (http://www.athle.fr) about their perceptions
   regarding injuries and injury risk reduction behaviours. We
   statistically compared athletes who already experienced an injury and
   those who did not.Results A total of 7870 athletes were included. 90\%
   of athletes declared having experienced at least one injury. They (1)
   were proportionally more men than women, (2) had significantly more
   years of experience in athletics, (3) had a significant difference in
   disciplines (more hurdles, jumps and combined events and fewer sprint
   athletes), (4) had a significant difference in competition levels (more
   national and less departmental levels) and (5) reported significantly
   higher values or agreements in favour of injury risk reduction approach,
   compared with uninjured athletes. There were significantly more athletes
   declaring following injury risk reduction programmes among athletes who
   experienced at least one injury than those who did not.Conclusions
   Athletes who experienced at least one injury during their lifetime were
   more prone to adhere to injury risk reduction strategies than athletes
   who have never experienced an injury. Their entourage (coaches and
   health professionals) should use this fertile ground to implement injury
   risk reduction strategies. In addition, their experience should be
   disseminated to uninjured athletes to help them adhere to injury risk
   reduction without injury experience.},

Title = {Thriving from work questionnaire: Spanish translation and validation},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 27},
Abstract = {BackgroundThriving from Work is a construct that has been highlighted as
   an important integrative positive worker well-being indicator that can
   be used in both research and practice. Recent public discourse
   emphasizes the important contributions that work should have on workers'
   lives in positive and meaningful ways and the importance of valid and
   reliable instruments to measure worker well-being. The Thriving from
   Work Questionnaire measures how workers' experiences of their work and
   conditions of work contributes in positive ways to their thriving both
   at and outside of work.MethodsThe purpose of this study was to translate
   the Thriving from Work Questionnaire from English to Spanish, and then
   validate the translated questionnaire in a sample of 8,795 finance
   workers in Peru and Mexico. We used item response theory models
   replicating methods that were used for the original validation studies.
   We conducted a differential item functioning analysis to evaluate any
   differences in the performance of models between Peru and Mexico. We
   evaluated criterion validity with organizational leadership,
   flourishing, vitality, community well-being, and worker's home location
   socio-economic position.ResultsThe current study demonstrates that the
   Spanish (Peru/Mexico) questionnaire was found to be a reliable and valid
   measure of workers' thriving from work. One item was dropped from the
   long-form version of the original U.S. questionnaire. Both the long and
   short form versions of the questionnaire had similar psychometric
   properties. Empirical reliability was high. Criterion validity was
   established as hypothesized relationships between constructs was
   supported. There were no differences in the performance of the model
   between countries suggesting utility across Latin American
   countries.ConclusionsThe current study demonstrated that the Spanish
   (Peru and Mexico) version of the questionnaire is both a reliable and
   valid measure of worker well-being in Latin America. Specific
   recommendations are made for the adaptation of the questionnaire and
   directions of future research.},

Title = {NIR-Light-Triggered Mild-Temperature Hyperthermia to Overcome the
   Cascade Cisplatin Resistance for Improved Resistant Tumor Therapy},
Journal = {ADVANCED HEALTHCARE MATERIALS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},
Number = {11},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Currently, cisplatin resistance has been recognized as a multistep
   cascade process for its clinical chemotherapy failure. Hitherto, it
   remains challenging to develop a feasible and promising strategy to
   overcome the cascade drug resistance (CDR) issue for achieving
   fundamentally improved chemotherapeutic efficacy. Herein, a novel
   self-assembled nanoagent is proposed, which is constructed by Pt(IV)
   prodrug, cyanine dye (cypate), and gadolinium ion (Gd3+), for
   systematically conquering the cisplatin resistance by employing
   near-infrared (NIR) light activated mild-temperature hyperthermia in
   tumor targets. The proposed nanoagents exhibit high photostability,
   GSH/H+-responsive dissociation, preferable photothermal conversion, and
   enhanced cellular uptake performance. In particular, upon 785-nm NIR
   light irradiation, the generated mild temperature of approximate to 43
   degrees C overtly improves the cell membrane permeability and drug
   uptake, accelerates the disruption of intracellular redox balance, and
   apparently enhances the formation of Pt-DNA adducts, thereby effectively
   overcoming the CDR issue and achieves highly improved therapeutic
   efficacy for cisplatin-resistant tumor ablation.
   A novel self-assembled nanoagent (Cy-Pt@HA NP) is developed to conquer
   the cascade drug resistance (CDR) issue of cisplatin. The proposed
   nanoagent presents NIR light-triggered mild hyperthermia, superior
   cellular uptake, and tumor-microenvironment-responsive dissociation for
   effective ablation of drug-resistant tumors, thereby opening a new
   avenue for addressing CDR issue and maximizing the platinum-based
   therapeutic efficacy for cancer treatment.image},

   neoclassical benchmark of 0. Comparisons with 401(k) saving show most
   employees do not treat HSA money as fungible with retirement savings. In
   this setting, HSAs did not reduce health spending and instead increased

Title = {A partial empirical test of the general strain theory on cyberbullying
   victimization among expatriate students},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGICAL RESEARCH POLICY AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {35-52},
Month = {MAR 4},
Abstract = {PurposeThis study aims to examine social determinants and social strains
   of cyberbullying victimization among expatriate populations in
   high-income countries such as Qatar. The authors argue that expatriate
   students will be exposed to stains and pressures due to several factors,
   such as feeling alienated, lonely, homesick, insecure and helpless. This
   study examines a partial assumption of general strain theory (GST),
   which posits that expats' cyberbullying victimization can create
   negative stimuli that lead to negative feelings and, as a result, to
   delinquent behavior. The delinquent behavior can be seen as a coping
   method in encountering strains. Logistic regression analysis is applied
   (using SPSS v. 21) to test the hypothesis that the victimization of
   expats' cyberbullying could lead to strain and
   delinquency.Design/methodology/approachA sample of 2,428 expatriate
   students (46\% males and 54\% females) was randomly selected from seven
   public schools in Qatar. The average number of siblings in the household
   was 2.7. Around 10.8\% of the sample reported victimization by
   cyberbullying. Most came from intact families (80.6\%) compared to 19.4
   living in broken homes. Concerning the birth order of the student in the
   family, 25\% of the sample were firstborn, and 20\% were middle-born.
   Students' mother relationships were higher than students' father
   relationships (69\% vs 51\%, respectively). Fathers were higher in
   undergraduate education than mothers (60\% vs 49\%, respectively).
   Considering that 58\% of women did not have a job, most fathers work in
   administrative positions (47\% in administrative work and 39\% in
   professional positions) as opposed to mothers' positions (15\% and 21\%,
   respectively). The survey was distributed among expatriate students by
   trained researchers, teachers and social workers in public schools. The
   researchers explained the purpose of the study, confidentiality and
   potential risks and provided directions for completing the survey.
   Parents and their children provided signed informed consent before
   participation, following the institutional review boards of Qatar
   University's Human Subject Research Committee and the Ministry of Social
   Development. The victimization of cyberbullying is measured at the
   dichotomy level by asking a general cyberbullying question (In the last
   12 months, had you been bullied by other students using mobile messages,
   email, voice or video messages? Responses were 1 - yes and 0 - no). A
   definition of cyberbullying was included in the questionnaire.
   Independent measures are as follows: (1) demographic variables: gender,
   belief, health, number of friends and exposure to violence; (2) family
   variables: delinquent family, coercive parenting, family relations,
   family disputes, father absence and family ties; (3) school variables:
   school satisfaction, school violence, student fighting, teachers'
   violence, school truancy and going late to school; (4) imprudent
   behavior: smoking, alcohol, not using a seat belt, gambling, stealing
   less than 100 QR, chewing tobacco, stimuli, volatile drugs, sexual
   harassment, throwing garbage out of the car, cheating, vandalism and
   victimization.FindingsFindings showed that n = 255, 10.8\% of the
   expats' sample N = 2,428 reported victimization of cyberbullying, of
   whom 46\% were males and 54\% were females. A total of 24\% of the
   victims of cyberbullying were males, and 5.8\% were females. About a
   third of the sample were cyberbullying perpetrators (n = 716, 29.5\%).
   Victims of cyberbullying came from intact families (62.4\%) compared to
   broken families (37.6\%).
   A round third of the victims reported the absence of a father during
   their childhood (n = 78, 31.7\%). Most of the victims came from a
   typical community compared to the delinquent community (71.2\% vs
   28.2\%). About a third of the victims reported it was easy to talk with
   the father when needed (32\% compared to 42.7\%), who said it was easy.
   More than half of the victims do not use seat belts. A low percentage of
   them were gambling (n = 68, 27\% or 2.9\% of the total sample).
   Regarding escaping imprudent and delinquent behaviors, findings showed
   that a third and more than a tenth of the cyberbullying were smokers and
   alcoholics (n = 69, 27.4\% and n = 42, 16.7\% respectively). Moreover,
   among the most serious, widely spread student problems, around a quarter
   of the victims reported using chewing tobacco (Sweeka is the local name)
   (n = 54, 21.4\%). Finally, drug use among victims was more than a tenth
   of them (n = 41, 16.3\%). About a quarter of the victims reported
   stealing less than 100 QR (n = 67, 26.8\% or 2.9\% of the total sample).
   Concerning the crimes committed by victims, findings showed that more
   than forth of them committed assault (n = 71, 28.3\%), student fights (n
   = 202, 80.8\%), school violence (n = 117, 46.6\%) and half of the
   victims (50.2\%) were also victims of face-to-face bullying. Little
   below half of the sample was exposed to violence (n = 120, 48.6\%) and
   was the victim of violence in the past 12 months (n = 100, 40.8\%). A
   significant gender differences was found in the victimization of
   cyberbullying (1 = yes, 0 = no) (a = 000). Moreover, significant mean
   differences were found between expatriates student victimization of
   cyberbullying at (a = 000) in all strain variables. Using binary
   regression analysis to examine the equality of probability of being a
   victim of cyberbullying as accounted for by the independent variables,
   the model's predictability was 89.4\%. The Hosmer and Lemeshow test and
   omnibus tests support the model's fit (a = 000). Nagelkerke R2 shows
   that the stain variables accounted for 24\% of the variance in the
   expat's student victimization of cyberbullying.Research
   limitations/implicationsConceptualization and determination of what
   constitutes cyberbullying from the criminal law perspective are needed.
   Cyberbullying is defined as a form of violence and crime involving new
   technologies (Sun et al., 2016, p. 62). Policymakers should provide
   accessible and equitable access to the criminal justice system, the
   integration of expatriates and the provision of support services to
   avoid delinquency.Practical implicationsA social cohesion, inclusion and
   well-being policy is needed for expatriate students and their families
   in Qatar. In particular, cultural diversity policy and programs, a
   source of strength and enrichment should be promoted in educational
   settings. Social inclusion and cultural diversity programs could ease
   the alienation and marginalization that expatriate students may
   encounter in their host societies to prevent stains and negative
   emotions that lead to delinquency and criminal behaviors. Access to
   support services without discrimination to avoid health and
   psychological strains and risk factors. This includes but is not limited
   to avoidance of stigmatization, embarrassment, sense of helplessness,
   humiliation and other negative feelings toward expatriates. Awareness
   and promotion of cultural diversity values are needed to enhance
   cultural acceptance to reduce victimization among the expatriate
   population.
   Criminal law and security implications conceptualization and
   determination of what constitutes cyberbullying from the criminal law
   perspective are needed. Cyberbullying is a form of violence and crime
   involving new technologies (Sun et al., 2016). Policymakers should
   provide accessible and equitable access to the criminal justice system,
   integrating expatriates and providing support services to avoid
   delinquency. There is a pressing need for further research within the
   realm of crime and law to establish the precise legal boundaries
   surrounding cyberbullying and to delineate the potential scope for
   legislative measures aimed at safeguarding against victimization in
   Qatar. Although the state of Qatar has taken steps to address
   cyberbullying by incorporating it into relevant legal frameworks, there
   remains a gap in terms of specifically targeting cyberbullying involving
   children and adolescents. Despite the introduction of the new Cybercrime
   Prevention Law, the issue of cyberbullying among these vulnerable groups
   is not adequately addressed.Social implicationsSocial implication
   includes but is not limited to avoidance of stigmatization,
   embarrassment, sense of helplessness, humiliation and other negative
   feelings towards expatriate. Awareness and promotion of cultural
   diversity values is needed to enhance cultural acceptance to reduce
   victimization among expatriate population.Originality/valueThe present
   study examines some strain theory assumptions and the victimization of
   the cyberbullying expatriate population. This study tests a partial
   assumption of GST, which states that the expatriate population's
   exposure to the victimization of cyberbullying can lead to negative
   stimuli that, in return, create negative feelings and, as a result,
   imprudent and delinquent behavior. The cyberbullying behavior can be
   seen as an escaping and coping method in encountering strains. This
   study underscores the presence of cyberbullying within high schools
   among expatriate students, exerting significant effects on their
   personal, social and emotional behaviors. The novel insights gleaned
   from this investigation contribute substantively to the comprehension of
   both the pervasiveness and repercussions of cyberbullying on the
   well-being of expatriate students. This contribution is particularly
   vital, given the dearth of research in the field, largely attributable
   to the growing dependence of students on the internet for various cyber
   activities. This study examines a partial assumption of GST (in
   non-Western country). Moreover, it uses an advanced statistical analysis
   and large sample.},

Abstract = {Teams often fail to reach their potential because members' concerns
   about being socially accepted prevent them from offering their unique
   perspectives to the team. Drawing on relational self and
   self-affirmation theory, we argue that affirmation of team members'
   social worth by trusted people outside the team helps them internalize
   an identity as a valued contributor, thereby reducing social acceptance
   concerns and facilitating information sharing in teams. We devised three
   intervention studies to demonstrate the causal effect of social worth
   affirmation in teams. In Study 1, senior executive teams in which
   members experienced social worth affirmation performed better (compared
   to control teams) on a crisis simulation that required information
   sharing in teams. In Study 2, with U.S. military cadets, we examined
   social acceptance concerns as a mechanism by which social worth
   affirmation influences information sharing. In Study 3, we showed that
   social worth affirmation improves virtual teams' ability to share
   information by exchanging unique information cues. Our results suggest
   that affirmation of the social worth of team members through their
   personal relationships broadens their sense of self, thereby reducing
   their social concerns about being accepted by other members. This, in
   turn, leads to better information sharing in teams.},

Abstract = {Background
   Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) is a lifesaving strategy for
   critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aim
   to report the case series of critical patients receiving IMV in Wuhan
   and to discuss the timing of IMV in these patients. Methods
   Data of 657 patients admitted to emergency intensive care unit of
   Zhongnan Hospital and isolated isolation wards of Wuhan Union Hospital
   from January 1 to March 10, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. All
   medical records of 40 COVID-19 patients who required IMV were collected
   at different time points, including baseline (at admission), before
   receiving IMV, and before death or hospital discharge. Results
   Among 40 COVID-19 patients with IMV, 31 died, and 9 survived and was
   discharged. The median age was 70 years (interquartile range {[}IQR],
   62-76 years), and nonsurvivors were older than survivors. The median
   period from the noninvasive mechanic ventilation (NIV) or high-flow
   nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) to intubation was 7 hours (IQR, 2-42
   hours) in IMV survivors and 54 hours (IQR, 28-143 hours) in IMV
   nonsurvivors. We observed that, when the time interval from NIV/HFNC to
   intubation was less than 50 hours (about 2 calendar days), together with
   Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score of
   less than 10 or pneumonia severity index (PSI) score of less than 100,
   mortality can be reduced to 60\% or less. Prolonged interval from
   NIV/HFNC to intubation and high levels of APACHE II and PSI before
   intubation were associated with higher mortality in critically ill
   patients. Multiple organ damage was common among these nonsurvivors in
   the course of treatment. Conclusion
   Early initial intubation after NIV/HFNC might have a beneficial effect
   in reducing mortality for critically ill patients meeting IMV
   indication. Considering APACHE II and PSI scores might help physicians
   in decision making about timing of intubation for curbing subsequent
   mortality.},

Abstract = {The thromboxane A2 receptor (TP) has been implicated in restenosis after
   vascular injury, which induces vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC)
   migration and proliferation. However, the mechanism for this process is
   largely unknown. In this study, we report that TP signaling induces VSMC
   migration and proliferation through activating YAP/TAZ, two major
   downstream effectors of the Hippo signaling pathway. The TP-specific
   agonists {[}1S-{[}1 alpha,2 alpha(Z),3 beta(1E,3S{*}),4
   alpha]]-7-{[}3-{[}3-hydroxy-4-(4-odophenoxy)-1-butenyl]-7-oxabicyclo{[}2
   .2.1]hept-2-yll-5-hep-tenoic acid (1-BOP) and 9,11-dideoxy-9 alpha,11
   alpha-methanoepoxyprosta-5Z,13E-dien-l-oic acid (U-46619) induce YAP/TAZ
   activation in multiple cell lines, including VSMCs. YAP/TAZ activation
   induced by I-BOP is blocked by knockout of the receptor TP or knockdown
   of the downstream G proteins G alpha(12/13). Moreover, Rho inhibition or
   actin cytoskeleton disruption prevents I-BOP-induced YAP/TAZ activation.
   Importantly, TP activation promotes DNA synthesis and cell migration in
   VSMCs in a manner dependent on YAP/TAZ. Taken together, thromboxane A2
   signaling activates YAP/TAZ to promote VSMC migration and proliferation,
   indicating YAP/TAZ as potential therapeutic targets for cardiovascular
   diseases.},

Title = {Survival and Hemodynamics During Pediatric Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation
   for Bradycardia and Poor Perfusion Versus Pulseless Cardiac Arrest},

Abstract = {Objectives:
   The objective of this study was to compare survival outcomes and
   intra-arrest arterial blood pressures between children receiving
   cardiopulmonary resuscitation for bradycardia and poor perfusion and
   those with pulseless cardiac arrests.
   Design:
   Prospective, multicenter observational study.
   Setting:
   PICUs and cardiac ICUs of the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care
   Research Network.
   Patients:
   Children (< 19 yr old) who received greater than or equal to 1 minute of
   cardiopulmonary resuscitation with invasive arterial blood pressure
   monitoring in place.
   Interventions:
   None.
   Measurements and Main Results:
   Of 164 patients, 96 (59\%) had bradycardia and poor perfusion as the
   initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation rhythm. Compared to those with
   initial pulseless rhythms, these children were younger (0.4 vs 1.4 yr; p
   = 0.005) and more likely to have a respiratory etiology of arrest (p <
   0.001). Children with bradycardia and poor perfusion were more likely to
   survive to hospital discharge (adjusted odds ratio, 2.31; 95\% CI,
   1.10-4.83; p = 0.025) and survive with favorable neurologic outcome
   (adjusted odds ratio, 2.21; 95\% CI, 1.04-4.67; p = 0.036). There were
   no differences in diastolic or systolic blood pressures or event
   survival (return of spontaneous circulation or return of circulation via
   extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation). Among patients with
   bradycardia and poor perfusion, 49 of 96 (51\%) had subsequent
   pulselessness during the cardiopulmonary resuscitation event. During
   cardiopulmonary resuscitation, these patients had lower diastolic blood
   pressure (point estimate, -6.68 mm Hg {[}-10.92 to -2.44 mm Hg]; p =
   0.003) and systolic blood pressure (point estimate, -12.36 mm Hg
   {[}-23.52 to -1.21 mm Hg]; p = 0.032) and lower rates of return of
   spontaneous circulation (26/49 vs 42/47; p < 0.001) than those who were
   never pulseless.
   Conclusions:
   Most children receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation in ICUs had an
   initial rhythm of bradycardia and poor perfusion. They were more likely
   to survive to hospital discharge and survive with favorable neurologic
   outcomes than patients with pulseless arrests, although there were no
   differences in immediate event outcomes or intra-arrest hemodynamics.
   Patients who progressed to pulselessness after cardiopulmonary
   resuscitation initiation had lower intra-arrest hemodynamics and worse
   event outcomes than those who were never pulseless.},

Abstract = {Achieving an understanding of the extent of micronutrient adequacy
   across Europe is a major challenge. The main objective of the present
   study was to collect and evaluate the prevalence of low micronutrient
   intakes of different European countries by comparing recent nationally
   representative dietary survey data from Belgium, Denmark, France,
   Germany, The Netherlands, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom. Dietary
   intake information was evaluated for intakes of Ca, Cu, I, Fe, Mg, K,
   Se, Zn and the vitamins A, B-1, B-2, B-6, B-12, C, D, E and folate. The
   mean and 5th percentile of the intake distributions were estimated for
   these countries, for a number of defined sex and age groups. The
   percentages of those with intakes below the lower reference nutrient
   intake and the estimated average requirement were calculated. Reference
   intakes were derived from the UK and Nordic Nutrition Recommendations.
   The impact of dietary supplement intake as well as inclusion of
   apparently low energy reporters on the estimates was evaluated. Except
   for vitamin D, the present study suggests that the current intakes of
   vitamins from foods lead to low risk of low intakes in all age and sex
   groups. For current minerals, the study suggests that the risk of low
   intakes is likely to appear more often in specific age groups. In spite
   of the limitations of the data, the present study provides valuable new
   information about micronutrient intakes across Europe and the likelihood
   of inadequacy country by country.},

Abstract = {Background Global development goals increasingly rely on
   country-specific estimates for benchmarking a nation's progress. To meet
   this need, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors
   Study (GBD) 2016 estimated global, regional, national, and, for selected
   locations, subnational cause-specific mortality beginning in the year
   1980. Here we report an update to that study, making use of newly
   available data and improved methods. GBD 2017 provides a comprehensive
   assessment of cause-specific mortality for 282 causes in 195 countries
   and territories from 1980 to 2017.
   Methods The causes of death database is composed of vital registration
   (VR), verbal autopsy (VA), registry, survey, police, and surveillance
   data. GBD 2017 added ten VA studies, 127 country-years of VR data, 502
   cancer-registry country-years, and an additional surveillance
   country-year. Expansions of the GBD cause of death hierarchy resulted in
   18 additional causes estimated for GBD 2017. Newly available data led to
   subnational estimates for five additional countries Ethiopia, Iran, New
   Zealand, Norway, and Russia. Deaths assigned International
   Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for non-specific, implausible, or
   intermediate causes of death were reassigned to underlying causes by
   redistribution algorithms that were incorporated into uncertainty
   estimation. We used statistical modelling tools developed for GBD,
   including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODErn), to generate cause
   fractions and cause specific death rates for each location, year, age,
   and sex. Instead of using UN estimates as in previous versions, GBD 2017
   independently estimated population size and fertility rate for all
   locations. Years of life lost (YLLs) were then calculated as the sum of
   each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. All
   rates reported here are age-standardised.
   Findings At the broadest grouping of causes of death (Level 1),
   non-communicable diseases (NC Ds) comprised the greatest fraction of
   deaths, contributing to 73.4\% (95\% uncertainty interval {[}UI]
   72.5-74.1) of total deaths in 2017, while communicable, maternal,
   neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) causes accounted for 186\% (17.9-19.6),
   and injuries 8.0\% (7.7-8.2). Total numbers of deaths from NCD causes
   increased from 2007 to 2017 by 22.7\% (21.5-23.9), representing an
   additional 7.61 million (7. 20-8.01) deaths estimated in 2017 versus
   2007. The death rate from NCDs decreased globally by 7.9\% (7.08.8). The
   number of deaths for CMNN causes decreased by 222\% (20.0-24.0) and the
   death rate by 31.8\% (30.1-33.3). Total deaths from injuries increased
   by 2.3\% (0-5-4-0) between 2007 and 2017, and the death rate from
   injuries decreased by 13.7\% (12.2-15.1) to 57.9 deaths (55.9-59.2) per
   100 000 in 2017. Deaths from substance use disorders also increased,
   rising from 284 000 deaths (268 000-289 000) globally in 2007 to 352 000
   (334 000-363 000) in 2017. Between 2007 and 2017, total deaths from
   conflict and terrorism increased by 118.0\% (88.8-148.6). A greater
   reduction in total deaths and death rates was observed for some CMNN
   causes among children younger than 5 years than for older adults, such
   as a 36.4\% (32.2-40.6) reduction in deaths from lower respiratory
   infections for children younger than 5 years compared with a 33.6\%
   (31.2-36.1) increase in adults older than 70 years. Globally, the number
   of deaths was greater for men than for women at most ages in 2017,
   except at ages older than 85 years. Trends in global YLLs reflect an
   epidemiological transition, with decreases in total YLLs from enteric
   infections, respirator\}, infections and tuberculosis, and maternal and
   neonatal disorders between 1990 and 2017; these were generally greater
   in magnitude at the lowest levels of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI).
   At the same time, there were large increases in YLLs from neoplasms and
   cardiovascular diseases. YLL rates decreased across the five leading
   Level 2 causes in all SDI quintiles. The leading causes of YLLs in 1990
   neonatal disorders, lower respiratory infections, and diarrhoeal
   diseases were ranked second, fourth, and fifth, in 2017. Meanwhile,
   estimated YLLs increased for ischaemic heart disease (ranked first in
   2017) and stroke (ranked third), even though YLL rates decreased.
   Population growth contributed to increased total deaths across the 20
   leading Level 2 causes of mortality between 2007 and 2017. Decreases in
   the cause-specific mortality rate reduced the effect of population
   growth for all but three causes: substance use disorders, neurological
   disorders, and skin and subcutaneous diseases.
   Interpretation Improvements in global health have been unevenly
   distributed among populations. Deaths due to injuries, substance use
   disorders, armed conflict and terrorism, neoplasms, and cardiovascular
   disease are expanding threats to global health. For causes of death such
   as lower respiratory and enteric infections, more rapid progress
   occurred for children than for the oldest adults, and there is
   continuing disparity in mortality rates by sex across age groups.
   Reductions in the death rate of some common diseases are themselves
   slowing or have ceased, primarily for NCDs, and the death rate for
   selected causes has increased in the past decade. Copyright (C) 2018 The
