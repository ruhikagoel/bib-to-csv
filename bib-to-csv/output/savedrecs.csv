"Roth, V and Straub, T and Richter, K",Security and usability engineering with particular attention to    electronic mail,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES,2005,63,1-2,51-73,JUL,"Support for strong electronic mail security is widely available yet only    few communicants appear to make use of these features. Apparently, the    operational overhead of security outweighs its perceived benefits.    Towards increasing the benefits versus overhead ratio we follow an    approach that considers security and usability tradeoffs from the    outset. We separate key exchange from binding keys to identities. The    best effort key exchange and key maintenance scheme that we devise    operates transparently for the user. We also describe complementary    visualization and interaction techniques that communicate the security    state of sent and received mail to users in a non-intrusive fashion.    Structured interviews were conducted with 19 users to assess the    usability of the metaphors and the complementary visualizations of the    security state. Towards a practical assessment of the overheads of    binding keys to identities, we conducted a quantitative analysis of 17    users' anonymized mailbox extracts to determine which security    mechanisms would be most appropriate for their communication patterns.    We argue that for individual non-commercial users, out-of-band    verification of keys could be more economical than building trust in    public key certificates issued by third parties.

As this phenomenon becomes increasingly common, concerns intensify    regarding security, secrecy, privacy, and information governance.    Consequently, secure tools have gained more evidence and new solutions    are emerging. However, literature shows the difficulty of adopting these    secure solutions, even though they are efficient for information    security, reinforcing the need for more effective security and privacy    models on the Web to increase their adoption by users in general. Thus,    it is necessary that the approaches to the development of security and    privacy solutions be understood by the users, facilitating their    adoption, without disregarding their contexts of use. Therefore, a    review of such solutions seems necessary. In this article, we    instantiate the usable security field for secure email and presented a    review of the main tools, seeking to understand the implemented task    model of each tool. With an analytical evaluation, we verified the    compliance of these solutions with the usable security guidelines    existing in the literature. Finally, we contribute to the usable    security field by indicating in which directions secure email tools    might be developed to accommodate the usable security guidelines.",SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",Proceedings Paper,English,"Ferreira, L (Corresponding Author), Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Comp Sci Dept, Adv Interact Lab LIA, Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil.

Leaving out the    user-dependent measures, say, S/MIME and PGP, this work concentrates on    the current security standards adopted in practice by providers to    safeguard the communications among their SMTP servers. To this end, we    developed a non-intrusive tool coined MECSA, which is publicly available    as a web application service to anyone who wishes to instantly assess    the security status of their email provider regarding both the inbound    and outbound communication channels. By capitalising on the data    collected by MECSA over a period of 15 months, that is, approximate to    7,650 assessments, analysing a total of 3,236 unique email providers, we    detail on the adoption rate of state-of-the-art email security    extensions, including STARTTLS, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and MTA-STS. Our    results indicate a clear increase in encrypted connections and in the    use of SPF, but also considerable retardation in the penetration rate of    the rest of the standards.

Using this method, communications between an    electronic mail (WWW) server and users (WWW browsers) can be performed    securely using Secure Socket Layer protocol-based Hypertext Transfer    Protocol (SSL-HTTP). The mail can be encrypted, signed, and sent to the    recipients and vice versa on the remote WWW server. The merit of this    method is that many healthcare users can use a secure electronic mail    system easily and immediately, because SSL-compatible WWW browsers are    widely used and this system can be made available simply by installing a    WWW-based mail user agent on a mail server. We implemented a WWW-based    mail user agent which is compatible with PEM-based secure mail and made    it available to about 16,000 healthcare users.

The massive deployment of this technology is certainly    due to its ease of use and interoperability. This advantageous ubiquity    of email communications comes nonetheless at the cost of security, which    is often side-lined in favour of maintaining backwards compatibility    with older versions of the protocols and considering security features    as optional to ensure compatibility between providers. As a consequence,    email communications often fall short of protecting the privacy and the    authenticity of the information exchanged. Taking into account the fact    that email is used to exchange private and personal information, the    latter risks become extremely prominent. We review here the outstanding    privacy and security risks in worldwide email communications and we    describe a set of practical countermeasures, based on combinations of    existing standards, which are capable of effectively mitigating the    identified risks.

Is this simply due to a failure to apply standard user    interface design techniques to security? We argue that, on the contrary,    effective security requires a different usability standard, and that it    will not be achieved through the user interface design techniques    appropriate to other types of consumer software.    To test this hypothesis, we performed a case study of a security program    which does have a good user interface by general standards: PGP 5.0. Our    case study used a cognitive walkthrough analysis together with a    laboratory user test to evaluate whether PGP 5.0 can be successfully    used by cryptopraphy novices to achieve effective electronic mail    security. The analysis found a number of user interface design flaws    that may contribute to security failures, and the user test demonstrated    that when our test participants were given 90 minutes in which to sign    and encrypt a message using PGP 5.0, the majority of them were unable to    do so successfully.    We conclude that PGP 5.0 is not usable enough to provide effective    security for most computer users, despite its attractive graphical user    interface, supporting our hypothesis that user interface design for    effective security remains an open problem.

A subset of such tools allows users to encrypt    confidential emails, as well as manage their access control using    features such as the expiration time, disabling forwarding, persistent    protection, and watermarking. Previous studies have suggested that    protective attitudes and behaviors could improve the adoption of new    security technologies. Therefore, we conducted a user study on 19    participants to understand their perceptions of an email security tool    and how they use it to manage access control to confidential information    such as medical, tax, and employee information if sent via email. Our    results showed that the participants' first impression upon receiving an    end-to-end encrypted email was that it looked suspicious, especially    when received from an unknown person. After the participants were    informed about the importance of the investigated tool, they were    comfortable sharing medical, tax, and employee information via this    tool. Regarding access control management of the three types of    confidential information, the expiration time and disabling forwarding    were most useful for the participants in preventing unauthorized and    continued access. While the participants did not understand how the    persistent protection feature worked, many still chose to use it,    assuming it provided some extra layer of protection to confidential    information and prevented unauthorized access. Watermarking was the    least useful feature for the participants, as many were unsure of its    usage.

Existing email encryption    approaches are comprehensive but seldom used due to their complexity and    inconvenience. We take a newapproach to simplify email encryption and    improve its usability by implementing receiver-controlled encryption:    newly received messages are transparently downloaded and encrypted to a    locally-generated key; the original message is then replaced. To avoid    the problem of moving a single private key between devices, we implement    per-device key pairs: only public keys need be synchronized via a simple    verification step. Compromising an email account or server only provides    access to encrypted emails.

Furthermore, TORPEDO    provides an information diagram to explain phish detection. We evaluated    TORPEDO's effectiveness, as compared to the worst case ``status bar{''}    as provided by other Web email interfaces. People using TORPEDO    performed significantly better in detecting phishes and identifying    legitimate emails (85.17\% versus 43.31\% correct answers for phish).

IEEE COMPUTER SOC,FreeAuth: Privacy-Preserving Email Ownership Authentication with    Verification-Email-Free,,2024,,,336-352,,"Electronic mail, as one of the most widely used identifiers, is    extensively utilized for account registration and recovery, two-factor    authentication, and organizational identification. Traditional email    ownership authentication is typically achieved through verification    codes or links sent via email, which leads to full disclosure of a    user's email address.    We propose FreeAuth, an innovative and universal email ownership    authentication scheme that enhances privacy by allowing users to    selectively disclose email-related information. FreeAuth distinguishes    itself from precedents by eschewing verification emails, thus avoiding    spam marking and online behavior tracking. It establishes an    authentication interaction paradigm based on widely deployed email    transmission protocols, such as SMTP, IMAP, and POP3, ensuring legacy    compatibility and server obliviousness. Meanwhile, it utilizes TLS    Oracle schemes to protect data privacy by disclosing only the    authentication outcome of the interaction, rather than revealing the    full email address. FreeAuth can be integrated as an alternative to    traditional email ownership authentication schemes.    We present details of FreeAuth architecture and instantiations of    prototype systems, along with three tailored examples of selective email    address disclosures to align with various scenario requirements. The    experimental analysis indicates that FreeAuth is compatible with up to    96\% of existing email providers, and it is notably efficient, requiring    only 2.5 seconds of online time to complete ownership authentication in    our wide area network settings.",IEEE COMPUTER SOC,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Li, BY (Corresponding Author), Beihang Univ, Sch Cyber Sci \& Technol, Beijing, Peoples R China.

In this paper, we propose a textual-graphical hybrid    authentication scheme that improves the security, memorability and    usability inadequacies of existing authentication schemes. This has been    achieved by combining a range of mechanisms together, in a novel manner,    to address weaknesses of the existing security schemes. Firstly, two    dynamically selectable modes of password entry (Easy Login, and Secure    Login) provide a trade-off between usability and security, allowing the    user to dynamically switch to any of these methods in real-time based on    the security of the surrounding environment (e.g., secure home    environment versus insecure public places) or the criticality of the    user account (e.g., a bank account). The other mechanisms included a    novel use of the drawmetric mechanism for setting the password to    improve memorability, multistep authentication, a novel adaptation of    one-time password (OTP) concept using a random selection of password    elements, random placement of password elements in different steps,    assigning random numbers to the password elements to increase security,    and use of simple addition to improve security. We have implemented and    analysed the proposed scheme for its security against brute-force    attacks, dictionary, shoulder surfing, random guessing, phishing or    forming, keystroke/mouse logger, and multiple recording attacks. We have    also investigated its usability and memorability, reporting various    trends of password elements used and the respective authentication    times. Moreover, we have compared the proposed scheme with eight other    well-known authentication schemes in terms of its resilience and    authentication time. The results and analyses demonstrate the    effectiveness of the proposed scheme. We believe that a range of novel    methods introduced in this proposed scheme opens several doors for    innovation in security techniques.",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Article,English,"Nizamani, SZ (Corresponding Author), Quaid E Awam Univ Engn Sci \& Technol, Informat Technol Dept, Nawabshah 67480, Pakistan.

Because they propagate over a logical network, the    traditional epidemic model is unsuitable for modeling their propagation    over the internet. However, it is no doubt that accurate modeling the    propagation of email worms is helpful to contain th9eir attacks in    advance. This paper presents a novel email worms' propagation model,    which is based on a directed and weighted social network. Moreover, the    effects of user's behavior are also considered in this model. To the    author's knowledge, there is little information available considering    the effects of them in modeling their propagation. A simulation    algorithm is designed for verifying the effectiveness of the presented    model. The results show that the presented model can describe the    propagation of email worms accurately. Through simulating different    containing strategies, we demonstrate that the infected key nodes in    email social community can speed up the worm propagating.

ACM,The Effect of Length on Key Fingerprint Verification Security and    Usability,,2023,,23,,,"In applications such as end-to-end encrypted instant messaging, secure    email, and device pairing, users need to compare key fingerprints to    detect impersonation and adversary-in-the-middle attacks. Key    fingerprints are usually computed as truncated hashes of each party's    view of the channel keys, encoded as an alphanumeric or numeric string,    and compared out-of-band, e.g. manually, to detect any inconsistencies.    Previous work has extensively studied the usability of various    verification strategies and encoding formats, however, the exact effect    of key fingerprint length on the security and usability of key    fingerprint verification has not been rigorously investigated. We    present a 162-participant study on the effect of numeric key fingerprint    length on comparison time and error rate. While the results confirm some    widely-held intuitions such as general comparison times and errors    increasing significantly with length, a closer look reveals interesting    nuances. The significant rise in comparison time only occurs when highly    similar fingerprints are compared, and comparison time remains    relatively constant otherwise. On errors, our results clearly    distinguish between security non-critical errors that remain low    irrespective of length and security critical errors that significantly    rise, especially at higher fingerprint lengths. A noteworthy implication    of this latter result is that Signal /WhatsApp key fingerprints provide    a considerably lower level of security than usually assumed.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Proceedings Paper,English,"Shahandashti, SF (Corresponding Author), Univ York, York, N Yorkshire, England.

Traditional email applications are widely used    by a large population; however, illiterate and semi-illiterate people    face challenges in using them. A major population of Pakistan is    illiterate that has little or no practice of computer usage. In this    paper, we investigate the challenges of using email applications by    illiterate and semi-illiterate people. In addition, we also propose a    solution by developing an application tailored to the needs of    illiterate/semi-illiterate people. Research shows that illiterate people    are good at learning the designs that convey information with pictures    instead of text-only, and focus more on one object/action at a time. Our    proposed solution is based on designing user interfaces that consist of    icons and vocal/audio instructions instead of text. Further, we use    background voice/audio which is more helpful than flooding a picture    with a lot of information. We tested our application using a large    number of users with various skill levels (from no computer knowledge to    experts).

TEA can cryptographically generate exclusive    email addresses for each sender, with the ability to re-establish a new    email address once the old one is compromised. TEA accomplishes    proof-of-work by integrating a challenge-response mechanism to be    completed before an email is accepted in the recipient's mail system.    The system rejects all incoming emails and instead embeds the challenge    inside the rejection notice of Standard Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)    error messages. The system does not create an out-of-band email for the    challenge, thus eliminating email backscatter in comparison to other    challenge-response email systems. The system is also effective in    identifying spammers by exposing the exact channel, i.e. the unique    email address that was compromised, so misuse could be traced back to    the compromising party.

"Brooke, Phil and Paige, Richard",User-visible cryptography in email and web scenarios,INFORMATION AND COMPUTER SECURITY,2015,23,1,58-72,,"Purpose - This paper aims to classify different types of ``user-visible    cryptography{''} and evaluate the value of user-visible cryptographic    mechanisms in typical email and web scenarios for non-expert IT users.    Design/methodology/approach - The authors review the existing    literature, and then identify user stories typical to their users of    interest. They analyse the risks, mitigations of risks and the limits of    those mitigations in the user stories.    Findings - The scenarios identified suggest that background,    opportunistic encryption has value, but more explicit, user-visible    cryptographic mechanisms do not provide any further mitigation. Other    mechanisms beyond technological mitigations provide the required    mitigation for the users.    Research limitations/implications - Further work should be carried out    on the trust issues with trusted third parties, as they are intrinsic to    global, automated cryptographic mechanisms. The authors suggest that    deployed systems should rely on automation rather than explicit user    involvement; further work on how best to involve users effectively    remains valuable.    Practical implications - Deployed systems should rely on automation    rather than explicit user dialogues. This follows from recognised    aspects of user behaviour, such as ignoring dialogues and unconsciously    making a holistic assessment of risk that is mostly mitigated by social    factors.    Social implications - The user populations concerned rely significantly    on the existing legal and social infrastructure to mitigate some risks,    such as those associated with e-commerce. Guarantees from third parties    and the existence of fallback procedures improve user confidence.    Originality/value - This work uses user stories as a basis for a    holistic review of the issues surrounding the use of cryptography. The    authors concentrate on a relatively large population (non-expert IT    users) carrying out typical tasks (web and email).",EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",Review,English,"Brooke, P (Corresponding Author), Teesside Univ, Sch Comp, Middlesbrough, Cleveland, England.

IEEE,Detecting misalignments between system security and user perceptions: a    preliminary socio-technical analysis of an E2E email encryption system,,2019,,,172-181,,"The set of impressions that a user has about distinct aspects of a    system depends on the experience perceived while interacting with the    system. Considering the effects of these interactions in a security    analysis allows for a new class of security properties in terms of    misalignments between the system's technical guarantees and the user's    impressions of them. For instance, a property that we call ``false sense    of insecurity{''} identifies a situation in which a secure system    injects uncertainty in users, thus improperly transmitting the degree of    protection that it actually provides; another, which we call ``false    sense of security{''}, captures situations in which a system instills a    false sense of security beyond what a technical analysis would justify.    Both situations leave room for attacks. In this paper we propose a model    to define and reason about such socio-technical misalignments. The model    refers to and builds on the concept of security ceremonies, but relies    on user experience notions and on security analysis techniques to put    together the information needed to verify misalignment properties about    user's impressions and system's security guarantees. We discuss the    innovative insight of this pilot model for a holistic understanding of a    system's security.

There are very    challenging and limited studies on email user behaviors. To study user    behaviors related with phishing emails, we design and investigate an    email test platform to understand how users behave differently when they    read emails, some of which are phishing. We used a set of emails    including phishing emails from the real world. We collect experimental    data including participants' basic background information, time    measurement, and their answers to survey questions. We first check    whether or not factors such as intervention, phishing types, and    incentive mechanisms play a major role in user behaviors when phishing    attacks occur. We then evaluate the significance of each attribute with    a performance score. The performance score is a metric demonstrating how    a user makes a correct judgment on phishing while phishing attacks    occur.

Its popularity hides however significant gaps. Professional    email systems usually remedy such deficiencies by compiling a lot of    sophisticated features in a single monolithic policy which should    ideally take into account security requirements together with various    other specific needs. The main drawback of these approaches lies in    their inherent rigidity. They indeed grant no place for the concepts of    usage and context which are fundamental for any modern communication    service. The usage is determined by a user's intention of communication:    private, professional, administrative, official, military... Context is    clearly orthogonal to usage because a same usage may require different    features depending of the context. We propose to define a correspondence    model which for a given usage and context allows to dynamically derive a    correspondence type encapsulating the exact set of required features.    With this model, it becomes possible to define an advanced email system    which may dynamically cope with multiple policies instead of a single    monolithic one. By allowing a user to select the exact policy matching    her needs, we argue that our approach reduces her risk-taking, providing    in this way a confident advanced email system.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Cailleux, L (Corresponding Author), DGA Maitrise Informat, French Minist Def, F-35998 Rennes, France.

"Al Maqbali, Fatma and Mitchell, Chris J.",Email-based password recovery - risking or rescuing users?,,2018,,,16-20,,"Secret passwords are very widely used for user authentication to    websites, despite their known shortcomings. Most websites using    passwords also implement password recovery to allow users to    re-establish a shared secret if the existing value is forgotten; many    such systems involve sending a password recovery email to the user, e.g.    containing a secret link. The security of password recovery, and hence    the entire user-website relationship, depends on the email being acted    upon correctly; unfortunately, as we show, such emails are not always    designed to maximise security and can introduce vulnerabilities into    recovery. To understand better this serious practical security problem,    we surveyed password recovery emails for 50 of the top English language    websites. We investigated a range of security and usability issues for    such emails, covering their design, structure and content (including the    nature of the user instructions), the techniques used to recover the    password, and variations in email content from one web service to    another. Many well-known web services, including Facebook, Dropbox, and    Microsoft, suffer from recovery email design, structure and content    issues.

A user    usually needs to send an e-mail to a group of users. In this paper, a    secure multicast key protocol for e-mail systems with providing perfect    forward secrecy is proposed to ensure confidentiality and authentication    of this kind of e-mail system. The protocol employs the Chinese    Remainder Theorem, RSA public key cryptosystems, and one-way hash    functions. The protocol can save redundant key materials used for the    e-mails. Via the security analysis, the protocol can satisfy the    security requirements. In addition, we analyze the computation    complexity of the protocol. The result showed that the protocol can save    the computation cost for each e-mail sender.

IEEE,A confident email system based on a new Correspondence Model,,2014,,,496-499,,"Despite all the current controversies, the success of the email service    is still valid. The ease of use of its various features contributed to    its widespread adoption. In general, the email system provides for all    its users the same set of features controlled by a single monolithic    policy. Such solutions are efficient but limited because they grant no    place for the concept of usage which denotes a user's intention of    communication: private, professional, administrative, official,    military.... The ability to efficiently send emails from mobile devices    creates new interesting opportunities. We argue that the context    (location, time, device, operating system, access network.) of the email    sender appears as a new dimension we have to take into account to    complete the picture. Context is clearly orthogonal to usage because a    same usage may require different features depending of the context.    It is clear that there is no global policy meeting requirements of all    possible usages and contexts. To address this problem, we propose to    define a correspondence model which for a given usage and context allows    to derive a correspondence type encapsulating the exact set of required    features. With this model, it becomes possible to define an advanced    email system which may cope with multiple policies instead of a single    monolithic one.

Because    email adoption could potentially reduce some of the disparities faced by    this age group, there is a need to understand factors determining older    patients' enthusiasm to use email to communicate with their physicians.    Electronic mail (email) represents a means of communication that,    coupled with face-to-face communication, could enhance quality of care    for older patients.    Objective: Testa model to determine factors associated with older    patients' enthusiasm to use email to communicate with their physicians.    Methods: We conducted a secondary data analysis of survey data collected    in 2003 for two large, longitudinal, randomized controlled trials.    Logistic-regression models were used to model the dichotomous outcome of    patient enthusiasm for using email to communicate with their physicians.    Explanatory variables included demographic characteristics, health    status, use of email with people other than their physician,    characteristics of the physician-patient relationship, and physician    enthusiasm to use email with patients.    Results: Participants included a pooled sample of 4059 patients over 65    years of age and their respective physicians (n = 181) from    community-based practices in Southern California. Although only 52    (1.3\%) patient respondents reported that they communicated with their    physician by email, about half (49.3\%) expressed enthusiasm about the    possibility of using it. Odds of being enthusiastic decreased with    increased age (by 0.97 for each year over 66) but were significantly    higher in African Americans (OR = 2.1, CI = 1.42 - 3.06), Hispanics (OR    = 1.6, CI = 1.26 - 2.14) and men (OR = 1.3, CI = 1.1 - 1.5). A    perception of better communication skills of their physician, lower    quality of interaction with physician in traditional face-to-face    encounters, and physician enthusiasm to use email with patients were    significantly associated with an enthusiasm to use email. Patients who    did not use email at all were less enthusiastic compared to those who    used email for other reasons. Half of the physician respondents were not    enthusiastic about communicating with patients using email.    Conclusions: Despite perceived barriers such as limited access to the    Internet, older patients seem to want to use email to communicate with    their physicians.","JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC","130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",Article,English,"Singh, H (Corresponding Author), VA Med Ctr 152, 2002 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX 77030 USA.

While previous research focuses on    strengthening user passwords, the security risk imposed by email-based    password recovery has not yet been well studied. In this article, we    first conduct a measurement study to characterize the password recovery    activities in the wild. Specifically, we examine the authentication and    password recovery protocols from 239 traffic-heavy websites, confirming    that most of them use emails for password recovery. We further    scrutinize the security policy of leading email service providers and    show that a significant portion of them takes no or marginal effort to    protect user email accounts, leaving compromised email accounts readily    available for mounting password recovery attacks.

ACM,Bounce in the Wild: A Deep Dive into Email Delivery Failures from a    Large Email Service Provider,,2024,,,659-673,,"Abnormal email bounces seriously disrupt user lives and company    transactions. Proliferating security protocols and protection strategies    have made email delivery increasingly complex. A natural question is how    and why email delivery fails in the wild. Filling this knowledge gap    requires a representative global email delivery dataset, which is rarely    disclosed by email service providers (ESPs).    In this paper, we first systematically reveal the scale and root causes    of email bounces, and evaluate the email squatting risk in the real    world. Through a 15-month passive dataset from a large ESP, we present a    unique global view of 298M emails delivered to 3M receiver mail servers    in 169 countries. We find that 38M (12.93\%) emails fail to be delivered    in the first attempt, about one-third of which could be successfully    delivered after retrying, while the rest are permanently undeliverable.    Delving deeper into bounce reasons, we observe that poor server    reputation and network communication quality are significant factors    leading to temporary email bounces. In particular, spam blocklists    affect many normal email deliveries. The misconfiguration of    authentication mechanisms and email address typos result in many    permanently undeliverable emails. More seriously, many email addresses    with significant residual value can be exploited by squatting attackers.    Overall, we call for the community to revisit email delivery failures,    especially to improve standards for email bounce reporting and    resolution.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Proceedings Paper,English,"Li, RX (Corresponding Author), Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.

Many MUAs support email encryption functionality to ensure the    confidentiality of emails. In practice, they encrypt the content of an    email using email encryption standards such as OpenPGP or S/MIME, mostly    implemented using GnuPG. Despite their widespread deployment, there has    been insufficient research on their software structure and the security    dependencies among the software components of MUA programs. In order to    understand the security implications of the structures and analyze any    possible vulnerabilities of MUA programs, we investigated a number of    MUAs that support email encryption. As a result, we found severe    vulnerabilities in a number of MUAs that allow cache side-channel    attacks in virtualized desktop environments. Our analysis reveals that    the root cause originates from the lack of verification and control over    the third-party cryptographic libraries that they adopt. In order to    demonstrate this, we implemented a cache side-channel attack on RSA in    GnuPG and then conducted an evaluation of the vulnerability of 13 MUAs    that support email encryption in Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04 and 18.04. Based on    our experiment, we found that 10 of these MUA programs (representing    approximately 77\% of existing MUA programs) allow the installation of a    vulnerable version of GnuPG, even when the latest version of GnuPG,    which is secure against most cache side-channel attacks, is in use. In    order to substantiate the importance of the vulnerability we discovered,    we conducted a FLUSH+RELOAD attack on these MUA programs and    demonstrated that the attack restored 92\% of the bits of the 2048-bit    RSA private key when the recipients read a single encrypted email.",MDPI,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Article,English,"Hur, J (Corresponding Author), Korea Univ, Dept Comp Sci \& Engn, Seoul 02841, South Korea.

"Loetter, Andre and Futcher, Lynn",A framework to assist email users in the identification of phishing    attacks,INFORMATION AND COMPUTER SECURITY,2015,23,4,370-381,,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a framework to address    the problem that email users are not well-informed or assisted by their    email clients in identifying possible phishing attacks, thereby putting    their personal information at risk. This paper therefore addresses the    human weakness (i.e. the user's lack of knowledge of phishing attacks    which causes them to fall victim to such attacks) as well as the    software related issue of email clients not visually assisting and    guiding the users through the user interface.    Design/methodology/approach - Aliterature study was conducted in the    main field of information security with a specific focus on    understanding phishing attacks and a modelling technique was used to    represent the proposed framework. This paper argues that the framework    can be suitably implemented for email clients to raise awareness about    phishing attacks. To validate the framework as a plausible mechanism, it    was reviewed by a focus group within the School of Information and    Communication Technology (ICT) at the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan    University (NMMU). The focus group consisted of academics and research    students in the field of information security.    Findings - This paper argues that email clients should make use of    feedback mechanisms to present security related aspects to their users,    so as to make them aware of the characteristics pertaining to phishing    attacks. To support this argument, it presents a framework to assist    email users in the identification of phishing attacks.    Research limitations/implications - Future research would yield    interesting results if the proposed framework were implemented into an    existing email client to determine the effect of the framework on the    user's level of awareness of phishing attacks. Furthermore, the list of    characteristics could be expanded to include all phishing types (such as    clone phishing, smishing, vishing and pharming). This would make the    framework more dynamic in that it could then address all forms of    phishing attacks.    Practical implications - The proposed framework could enable email    clients to provide assistance through the user interface. Visibly    relaying the security level to the users of the email client, and    providing short descriptions as to why a certain email is considered    suspicious, could result in raising the awareness of the average email    user with regard to phishing attacks.    Originality/value - This research presents a framework that email    clients can use to identify common forms of normal and spear phishing    attacks. The proposed framework addresses the problem that the average    Internet user lacks a baseline level of online security awareness. It    argues that the email client is the ideal place to raise the awareness    of users regarding phishing attacks.",EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Lötter, A (Corresponding Author), Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Sch Informat Commun Technol, Port Elizabeth, South Africa.

ACM,Adaptive Semi-Private Email Aliases,,2012,,,,,"Email address leakages are the cause of several security problems    including spam and privacy loss. With current email addresses, once the    address leaks without its owner's consent, it becomes effectively    compromised, creating a struggle for the user to keep the address out of    the hands of new spammers. To compound the problem, some websites    require addresses belonging to a certain domain (e.g., <university>.edu)    as a partial proof of the user's affiliation with an organization. This    leaves the user not much choice except to have faith that the address    will not be misused.    To address the problem, this paper improves on the prior work on    disposable email addresses by proposing a mechanism called semiprivate    aliases. Semi-private aliases make two contributions. First, they have a    lifecycle model that permits gradual, selective controls on the use of    the alias by senders without requiring any special infrastructure on the    part of senders or receivers. Second, semiprivate aliases can be easily    used to validate a user belonging to a certain organization (e.g.,    university or company) and reveal only selected attributes to a service    while hiding the real identity. The second aspect recently proved useful    in allowing students in one of our freshmen courses to register easily    and safely at Piazza.com, a discussion forum for courses, that, by    default, requires students to provide a university email address, but    has privacy policies that differ from a university's.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Ng, BH (Corresponding Author), Univ Michigan, Dept Comp Sci \& Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.

We argue that the    non-adoption of end-to-end encryption might not be entirely due to    usability issues identified by Whitten and Tygar in their seminal paper    ``Why Johnny Can't Encrypt{''}. Our investigation revealed a number of    fundamental issues such as incomplete threat models, misaligned    incentives, and a general absence of understanding of the email    architecture. From our data and related research literature we found    evidence of a number of potential explanations for the low uptake of    end-to-end encryption. This suggests that merely increasing the    availability and usability of encryption functionality in email clients    will not automatically encourage increased deployment by email users.

Several    powerful techniques have been developed to counteract spoofing, but most    of them are server-oriented and transparent to the user.

This application allows a client to send    trusted emails and authenticate received emails using the SSL protocol.    The application has been developed in Java and it provides users with a    table populated with details of all devices on a subnet. It uses    cryptographic self-signed certificates to exchange a secure    authentication message alongside the email with a view to prevent    spoofing. The application has been tested on devices within the same    subnet and it successfully authenticated valid email messages and    detected spoofed ones.

To protect such archives, we propose    a novel user-specific design for an anomaly-based email archive    intrusion detection system.

In tests using data gathered from three months of observed user    behavior and synthetic models of attacker behavior this model exhibits a    low rate of false positives (generally one false alarm every few weeks)    while still detecting most attacks.

IEEE,An Email Application with Active Spoof Monitoring and Control,,2016,,,,,"Spoofing is a serious security issue for email applications. Although    several anti-email spoofing techniques have been developed, most of them    do not provide users with sufficient control and information on spoof    attacks. In this paper a web-based client oriented anti-spoofing email    application is proposed which actively detects, monitors and controls    email spoofing attacks. When the application detects a spoofed message,    it triggers an alert message and sends the spoofed message into a spoof    filter. Moreover, the user who has received the spoofed message is given    the option of notifying the real sender of the spoofing attack. In this    way an active spoof control is achieved. The application is hosted using    the HTTPS protocol and uses notification messages that are sent in    parallel with email messages via a channel that has been secured by the    Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. The notification messages allows the    application to detect spoofed emails.

Acad Conf Ltd,Information Security and Practice: The User's Perspective,,2016,,,81-89,,"The use of Information Technology (IT) has become common practice in our    everyday lives both for business and private purposes. While people    enjoy the convenience that IT offers, it also poses various security    threats if not used properly, including malware, hacking, and    information disclosure. Unfortunately, the scale and consequence of    cyber threats has increased significantly year-on-year despite various    security controls having been developed and deployed. It is evident that    end users play a significant role within the information security    domain, as they are frequently the primary target and the main force    behind incidents. Nonetheless, whilst there are annual security surveys    for organisations, less effort were given regarding assessing how    individuals practice information security by the research community.    Therefore, this paper presents a survey that investigates user's IT    security practice and behaviour. In total, 400 respondents were surveyed    during a five month period (i.e. November 2014 - March 2015). Overall,    the results demonstrate that end users practice better IT security than    typically thought although it appears only at a relatively basic level.    For example, whilst a reasonably good proportion of participants (66\%)    claimed that they never share their passwords with others, 76\% have    used the same password on multiple sensitive accounts. Almost three    quarters (72\%) of responders never click on links or attachments within    emails from unknown sources, but this is significantly reduced (to 36\%)    when someone they knew sent the email. Two-thirds of users (65\%) do    appreciate the importance of antivirus software as they always keep    their antivirus software updated; however, less care is given to other    applications/systems as only 44\% would do the same and more alarmingly    65\% even cancel or delay the security update process. Over two thirds    (68\%) of participants do not always backup their data, and only half of    the participants (53\%) claimed that they always destroy their data    before hardware disposal. The results of the survey suggest that whilst    levels of awareness are improving, there is still a significant gap    between existing and required levels of information security knowledge    and practice. Arguably, users are currently being overwhelmed by the    burden being placed upon them to remain secure. The range of    technologies they use (60\% using more than 3 devices), the widespread    use of online services (89\% using at least 5 IT services) highlight    users are becoming or have become technology dependent but perhaps    without being security savvy.",ACAD  CONFERENCES LTD,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",Proceedings Paper,English,"Clarke, N (Corresponding Author), Univ Plymouth, Ctr Secur Commun \& Network Res, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England.

"Bryant, Kay and Campbell, John",USER BEHAVIOURS ASSOCIATED WITH PASSWORD SECURITY AND MANAGEMENT,AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS,2006,14,1,81-100,NOV,"Control mechanisms established on the boundary of an information system    are an important preliminary step to minimising losses from security    breaches. The primary function of such controls is to restrict the use    of information systems and resources to authorized users. Password-based    systems remain the predominant method of user authentication despite the    many sophisticated and viable security alternatives that have emerged    from research and development. However, the literature shows that    passwords are often compromised through the poor security and management    practices of users. This paper examines user password composition and    security practices for email accounts. The results of a survey that    examines user practice in creating and using passwords are reported. The    results show that many users know about the risks of hackers, viruses    and so on and take preliminary steps to combat them such as having    passwords longer than eight characters. However, this appears to be as    far as many users are willing to accede to the probability that their    information and computing resources can be compromised. This paper makes    some recommendations for the education of users in creating and    maintaining their passwords. The responsibility for these educational    programs can be shared between governments, organisations, educational    institutions at all levels, and software vendors.","UNIV CANBERRA, FAC INFORMATION SCIENCES \& ENGINEERING","BLDG 11, KIRINARI ST, BRUCE, ACT 2617, AUSTRALIA",Article,English,"Bryant, K (Corresponding Author), Griffith Univ, Dept Management, Nathan, Qld, Australia.

IEEE,Simulation of the Users' Email Behavior based on BP-BDI Model,,2015,,,16-22,,"With the development of the Internet, email has become a part of our    life to communicate with each other. While bringing convenience for    users, it also threats the users' network security. For example, if the    user clicks on a malicious URL link in the email, the user's host is    likely to be injected by virus, resulting in subsequent network security    problems. We call the Internet users' operations on email ``users' email    behaviors{''}. Through simulating the user's behavior on email, we can    find the hidden dangers and threats of network security caused by user's    operation on email. In this paper, BP-BDI model is proposed to simulate    the user's behavior on email. The behavior learning module with BP    neural network is constructed on the basis of BDI (Belief Desire    Intention) model to learn the user's past behavior of email. As a    result, the accuracy of simulating the user's email behavior will be    improved. Finally, the experiment proves that the BP-BDI model can    simulate the user's email behavior accurately and effectively.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Sheng, Y (Corresponding Author), Natl Univ Def Technol, Sch Comp, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.

IEEE,Securing Email For The Average Users Via A New Architecture,,2017,,,,,"The ubiquity of the Internet and email, have provided a mostly insecure    communication medium for the consumer. During the last few decades, we    have seen the development of several ways to secure email messages.    However, these solutions are inflexible and difficult to use for    encrypting email messages to protect security and privacy while    communicating or collaborating via email. Under the current paradigm,    the arduous process of setting up email encryption is non-intuitive for    the average user. The complexity of the current practices has also    yielded to incorrect developers' interpretation of architecture which    has resulted in interoperability issues. As a result, the lack of simple    and easy-to-use infrastructure in current practices means that the    consumers still use plain text emails over insecure networks.    In this paper, we introduce and describe a novel, holistic model with    new techniques for protecting email messages. The architecture of our    innovative model is simpler and easier to use than those currently    employed. We use the simplified trust model, which can relieve users    from having to perform many complex steps to achieve email security.    Utilizing the new techniques presented in this paper can safeguard    users' email from unauthorized access and protect their privacy. In    addition, a simplified infrastructure enables developers to understand    the architecture more readily eliminating interoperability.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Nourai, M (Corresponding Author), Univ Massachusetts Lowell, Comp Sci Dept, Lowell, MA 01854 USA.

"Caffery, Liam J. and Smith, Anthony C.",A Literature Review of Email-based Telemedicine,,2010,161,,20-34,,"A structured analysis of peer-reviewed literature about the delivery of    health services by email was undertaken for this review. A total of 185    articles were included in the analysis. These articles were thematically    categorised for medical specialty, participants, sub-topic, study design    and service-delivery application.    It was shown that email-based telemedicine can be practiced in a large    number of medical specialties and has application in primary    consultation, second opinion consultation, telediagnosis and    administrative roles (e.g. e-referral). Email has niche applications in    low-bandwidth, image-based specialties (e.g. dermatology, pathology,    wound care and ophthalmology) where attached digital camera images were    used for telediagnosis. Diagnostic accuracy of these images was the    predominant topic of research and results show email as a valid means of    delivering these medical services. Email is also often used in general    practice as an adjunct for face-to-face consultation. Further, a number    of organisations have significantly improved the efficiency of their    outpatient services when using email as a triage or e-referral system.    Email-based telemedicine provides specialist medical opinion in the    majority of reviewed services and is most likely to be instigated by the    patient's primary care giver. However, email-consultations between    patient and primary care and patient and secondary care are not    uncommon.    Most email services are implemented using ordinary email. However, a    number of organisations have developed purpose-written email    applications to support their telemedicine service due to impediments of    using ordinary email. These impediments include lack of management tools    for: the allocation and auditing of cases for a timely response and the    co-ordination of effort in a multiclinician, multi-disciplinary service.    The ability to encrypt ordinary email thereby securing patient    confidentiality is also regarded as difficult when using ordinary email.    Hence, alternative web-based email applications where the encryption can    be implemented using the more user-friendly HTTPS have become popular.    Much of the reviewed literature is descriptive or anecdotal and hence,    suffers from lack of conclusive results regarding positive patient    outcomes. This may account for email-based telemedicine generally being    regarded as underutilised. However, the potential is well recognised.",IOS PRESS,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Proceedings Paper,English,"Caffery, LJ (Corresponding Author), Royal Childrens Hosp, Ctr Online Hlth, Level 3 Fdn Bldg, Herston, Qld, Australia.

This paper explores different interfaces for the    automated detection and management of email harassment using artificial    intelligence in order to investigate what degree of platform    intervention email users prefer when navigating their email platform.    Through conducting user studies involving three different email platform    prototypes based on the Gmail platform, we employ mixed-method analysis    to evaluate how varying levels of platform intervention affect users'    perceived sense of safety, agency, and trust with their email platform.    Our primary findings suggest that users generally benefited from each of    the system intervention strategies and desired higher intervention    features when combating email harassment, as well as ways of managing    this intervention based on their unique preferences.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Chen, NN (Corresponding Author), Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.

Assoc Comp Machinery,A Study of Neighbor Users Selection in Email Networks for Spam Filtering,,2018,,,22-26,,"Due to the protection of data security and personal privacy in email    networks, it is difficult to select the neighbor user using email user's    personalized attributes and behavior data. In daily life, the more    interactive the people are, the more similar they are. So many    researchers use the interaction strength to select the neighbor users.    But this method has not been experimentally verified. Receiving the same    email is the most basic condition that a neighbor user can provide a    valid recommendation to the target user. So, we build an email corpus    using real email data to verify the selection effect of different    methods. The emails come from Enron email data set, log files of a    Chinese corporate email server, and volunteers. This corpus contains    more than 870,000 users and more than 5.14 million emails. With this    corpus, we conducted experiments on seven different methods of neighbor    user selection. The experimental results show the effect of user    interaction strength is far from being as good as expected, and far    inferior to user social attributes. In addition, the recipient performs    far better than the sender.

Commonly    the spammers use compromised email accounts to send these emails, which    accounted for 57.9 percent of the global email traffic in September    2014. Previous research has primarily focused on the fast detection of    abused accounts to prevent the fraudulent use of servers.    State-of-the-art spam detection methods generally need the content of    the email to classify it as either spam or a regular message. This    content is not available within the new type of encrypted phishing    emails that have become prevalent since the middle of 2014. The object    of the presented research is to detect the anomaly with Mail User Agent    Access Activities, which is based on the special behaviour of how to    send emails without the knowledge of the email content.

"Marshall, Nina and Sturman, Daniel and Auton, Jaime C.",Exploring the evidence for email phishing training: A scoping review,COMPUTERS \& SECURITY,2024,139,103695,,APR,"Background: Phishing emails are a pervasive threat to the security of    confidential information. To mitigate this risk, a range of training    measures have been developed to target the human factors involved in    phishing email susceptibility. Despite the widespread use of    anti-phishing training programs, there is no clear understanding of the    extent to which these approaches have been assessed. Objective: The    primary aim of this scoping review was to identify and describe the    nature of available training interventions and their measurable outcomes    on user susceptibility, as reported in published articles. Methods:    Systematic searches identified 42 studies that met the inclusion    criteria. Each study was critically analysed, and a standardised data    extraction spreadsheet used to systemise the data that informed the    descriptive narrative review. Results: Findings revealed that near-term    training impact is well documented, however evidence on the success of    programs in driving sustained behavioral change is limited. Components    of training design influencing the effectiveness of outcomes included    training intensity, active approaches to learning, the provision of    detailed feedback, and supplementing attentional awareness skills-based    training with traditional cue-based approaches. Conclusions: Improved    user resilience to phishing emails confirms the utility of training as    an important defensive mechanism, although current approaches continue    to leave trainees at risk.",ELSEVIER ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY,"OXFORD FULFILLMENT CENTRE THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON,    OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Sturman, D (Corresponding Author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Psychol, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.

IEEE,Fighting Phishing with Trusted Email,,2010,,,462-467,,"Phishing is the combination of social engineering and technical exploits    designed to convince a victim to provide personal information, usually    for the monetary gain of the attacker (phisher). Attempts to stop    phishing by preventing a user from interacting with a malicious web site    have shown to be ineffective. We introduce a method to aid in the    prevention of phishing by combining automatic and transparent email    signing with an email client plugin. The plugin can detect unsigned    spoofed messages. In this manner, the user is prevented (or at least    discouraged) from visiting malicious web sites, thus stopping the    data-gathering phase of the phishing attack before it begins.

Technical    measures alone do not fully prevent users from falling for them and    common e-mail interfaces provide little support for users to check an    e-mail's legitimacy. We designed three email user security tools to    improve phishing detection within a common e-mail interface and provide    a formative evaluation of the usability of these features: two    psychological nudges to alert users of suspicious e-mails and a    ``check{''} button to enable users to verify an email's legitimacy.    Professional email users (N = 27) found the ``suspicion score{''} nudge    and ``check{''} button the most useful. These alerted users of    suspicious e-mails, without harming their productivity, and helped users    assert trust in legitimate ones. The other nudge was too easily ignored    or too disruptive to be effective. We also found that users arrive at    erroneous judgements due to differing interpretations of e-mail details,    even though two-thirds of them completed cybersecurity training before.    These findings show that usable and therefore effective e-mail user    security tools can be developed by leveraging cues of legitimacy that    augment existing user behaviour, instead of emphasising technical    security training.",USENIX ASSOC,"SUITE 215, 2560 NINTH ST, BERKELEY, CA 94710 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Zheng, SY (Corresponding Author), UCL, London, England.

Compared to earlier versions of    email malware, modern email malware exhibits two new features,    reinfection and self-start. Reinfection refers to the malware behavior    that modern email malware sends out malware copies whenever any healthy    or infected recipients open the malicious attachment. Self-start refers    to the behavior that malware starts to spread whenever compromised    computers restart or certain files are visited. In the literature,    several models are proposed for email malware propagation, but they did    not take into account the above two features and cannot accurately model    the propagation dynamics of modern email malware. To address this    problem, we derive a novel difference equation based analytical model by    introducing a new concept of virtual infected user. The proposed model    can precisely present the repetitious spreading process caused by    reinfection and self-start and effectively overcome the associated    computational challenges. We perform comprehensive empirical and    theoretical study to validate the proposed analytical model.

These tasks are cumbersome for the    average user. To make more accessible the use of encrypted email, a    secure email application named p equivalent to p automates the key    management operations; p equivalent to p still requires the users to    carry out the verification, however, the authentication process is    simple: users have to compare familiar words instead of strings of    random characters, then the application shows the users what level of    trust they have achieved via colored visual indicators. Yet, users may    not execute the authentication ceremony as intended, p equivalent to p's    trust rating may be wrongly assigned, or both. To learn whether p    equivalent to p's trust ratings (and the corresponding visual    indicators) are assigned consistently, we present a formal security    analysis of p equivalent to p's authentication ceremony. From the    software implementation in C, we derive the specifications of an    abstract protocol for public key distribution, encryption and trust    establishment; then, we model the protocol in a variant of the applied    pi calculus and later formally verify and validate specific privacy and    authentication properties.

Most phishing emails    aim at withdrawing money from financial institutions or getting access    to private information. Phishing has increased enormously over the last    years and is a serious threat to global security and economy. There are    a number of possible countermeasures to phishing. These range from    communicationoriented approaches like authentication protocols over    blacklisting to content-based filtering approaches.    We argue that the first two approaches are currently not broadly    implemented or exhibit deficits. Therefore content-based phishing    filters are necessary and widely used to increase communication    security. A number of features are extracted capturing the content and    structural properties of the email. Subsequently a statistical    classifier is trained using these features on a training set of emails    labeled as ham (legitimate), spam or phishing. This classifier may then    be applied to an email stream to estimate the classes of new incoming    emails.    In this paper we describe a number of novel features that are    particularly well-suited to identify phishing emails. These include    statistical models for the low-dimensional descriptions of email topics,    sequential analysis of email text and external links, the detection of    embedded logos as well as indicators for hidden salting. Hidden salting    is the intentional addition or distortion of content not perceivable by    the reader. For empirical evaluation we have obtained a large realistic    corpus of emails prelabeled as spam, phishing, and ham (legitimate). In    experiments our methods outperform other published approaches for    classifying phishing emails. We discuss the implications of these    results for the practical application of this approach in the workflow    of an email provider. Finally we describe a strategy how the filters may    be updated and adapted to new types of phishing.",IOS PRESS,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Bergholz, A (Corresponding Author), Fraunhofer IAIS, Schloss Birlinghoven, D-53754 St Augustin, Germany.

IEEE,A certificateless one-way group key agreement protocol for end-to-end    email encryption,,2018,,,34-43,,"Over the years, email has evolved into one of the most widely used    communication channels for both individuals and organizations. However,    despite near ubiquitous use in much of the world, current information    technology standards do not place emphasis on email security. Not until    recently, webmail services such as Yahoo's mail and Google's gmail    started to encrypt emails for privacy protection. However, the encrypted    emails will be decrypted and stored in the service provider's servers.    If the servers are malicious or compromised, all the stored emails can    be read, copied and altered. Thus, there is a strong need for end-to-end    (E2E) email encryption to protect email user's privacy. In this paper,    we present a certificateless one-way group key agreement protocol with    the following features, which are suitable to implement E2E email    encryption: (1) certificateless and thus there is no key escrow problem    and no public key certificate infrastructure is required; (2) one-way    group key agreement and thus no back-and-forth message exchange is    required; and (3) n-party group key agreement (not just 2- or 3-party).    This paper also provides a security proof for the proposed protocol    using ``proof by simulation{''}.

Ciphire Mail    provides automated secure public-key exchange using an automated    fingerprinting system. It uses cryptographic hash values to identify and    validate certificates, thus enabling clients to detect malicious    modification of certificates. This data is automatically circulated    among clients, making it impossible to execute fraud without alerting    users. The Ciphire system is a novel concept for making public-key    cryptography and key exchange usable for email communication. It is the    first transparent email encryption system that allows everyone to secure    their communications without a steep learning curve.",SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",Article; Proceedings Paper,English,,,0302-9743,1611-3349,Ciphire; secure email; email encryption; email authentication; digital    signatures; certificates; fingerprints; fingerprint system; PKI,Computer Science,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory \&    Methods",inproceedings,WOS:000231171200016,"Patrick, AS and Yung, M",FINANCIAL CRYPTOGRAPHY AND DATA SECURITY,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,"9th International Conference on Financial Cryptography, Roseau,    DOMINICA, FEB 28-MAR 03, 2005",3-540-26656-9,,Int Financial Cryptog Assoc,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The emails will    give users a better understanding that how things have changed and    evolved in the past. Much of the effort to visualize email has focused    on three areas of email archiving: exploring the relationship between    email volumes, mining the evolution of topics and events in emails, or    the relationship of email owners to their counterparts. But there are    currently fewer systems for analyzing their background stories through    mail dataset. In this paper, we present the Mail event, which is an    email visualization system. Its main purpose is to help users analyze    the main information in the mail data set, such as keywords, topics, and    event contents of the mail. Firstly, it helps users understand the    keywords and themes of the mail through a variety of different attempts.    Secondly, the way the email is matched into an event allows the user to    understand the story of the email corresponding to the email at a    certain point in time so that users can deeply understand the story    behind the email. In this system, through rich visual elements, users    can understand the e-mail dataset and have a further understanding of    the development of events and their anomalies, so as to better    coordinate or improve future work. Finally, the effectiveness of the    system is verified by case studies and user evaluation experiments.",SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,"152 BEACH ROAD, \#21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",Proceedings Paper,English,"Lu, Q (Corresponding Author), Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Comp \& Informat, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China.

This phenomenon has    mainly contributed to the growing usage of the World Wide Web, which is    considered as one of the inventions in computer technology that changed    the modes of human communication and exchange of information. As new    work tools, an increasing number of people are using online systems.    Accordingly, user authentication has become a significant issue in the    online environment. The traditional password is still the most common    means to verify user identity. However, strong passwords are sometimes    difficult to remember, and thus a recovery procedure is needed. It can    be said that the majority of online systems apply different methods of    recovery, such as using challenging questions besides the out-of-band    communication (i.e., email or SMS). Nevertheless, these approaches are    still suffering from security and usability problems. This study    therefore proposes a novel authentication method based on user interface    (UI) preferences, called the User Interface Preferences Authentication    (UIPA). This method can be applied with online systems that offer UI    designs since it provides users with the chance to choose a preferred    design of the interface on the basis of their personal characteristics.    Hence, the user identity is then verified based on that interface. The    performance, security, and usability of UIPA have been evaluated. The    results of the experiments show that UIPA has a false positive rate of    0.416\% and a false negative rate of 0\%. Moreover, a user acceptance    questionnaire, which has been designed based on the technology    acceptance model, shows that users are pleased and willing to accept the    proposed technique. To conclude, UIPA can be applied as an efficient    account recovery method compared with the currently used methods. It    could also help in addressing the security-usability trade-off-problem.

ACM,POSTER: Email Summarization to Assist Users in Phishing Identification,,2022,,,1234-1236,,"Cyber-phishing attacks recently became more precise, targeted, and    tailored by training data to activate only in the presence of specific    information or cues. They are adaptable to a much greater extent than    traditional phishing detection. Hence, automated detection systems    cannot always be 100\% accurate, increasing the uncertainty around    expected behavior when faced with a potential phishing email. On the    other hand, human-centric defence approaches focus extensively on user    training but face the difficulty of keeping users up to date with    continuously emerging patterns. Therefore, advances in analyzing the    content of an email in novel ways along with summarizing the most    pertinent content to the recipients of emails is a prospective gateway    to furthering how to combat these threats. Addressing this gap, this    work leverages transformer-based machine learning to (i) analyze    prospective psychological triggers, to (ii) detect possible malicious    intent, and to (iii) create representative summaries of emails. We then    amalgamate this information and present it to the user to allow them to    (i) easily decide whether the email is ``phishy{''} and (ii) self-learn    advanced malicious patterns.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Proceedings Paper,English,"Kashapov, A (Corresponding Author), Monash Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.

Our design avoids (1) key    escrow and deployment problems of previous IBC systems, (2) certificate    management, as in S/MIME, or participation in complicated Web of Trust,    as in PGP, and (3) impersonation attacks because it relies on key    transparency approaches where end users verify their identity and key    bindings. PriviPK uses a new CL key agreement protocol that has the    unique property that it allows users to update their public keys without    the need to contact a third party (such as a CA) for the recertification    process, which allows for cheap forward secrecy and key revocation    operations. Furthermore, PriviPK uniquely combines important privacy    properties such as forward secrecy, deniability (or non-deniability if    desired), and user transparency while avoiding the administrative    overhead of certificates for asynchronous communication. PriviPK enables    quick bootstrapping of shared keys among participating users, allowing    them to encrypt and authenticate each other transparently. We describe    an implementation of PriviPK and provide performance measurements that    show its minimal computational overhead.

Attackers target    our cognitive vulnerabilities with a varied set of techniques, and each    of us, not trained enough or simply in the wrong moment, can be deceived    and put an entire organization in trouble. To date, no study has    evaluated the behavior of users when confronted with phishing emails    characterized by a diverse set of features and attack strategies. We    created a system called Spamley from these observations, which has the    main aim of collecting and sharing data regarding such user behavior.    Spamley is also meant to disseminate awareness among users. To reach    these goals, we firstly analyzed the wide scientific literature on    phishing. Our analysis shows that the focus of studies on phishing has    more and more shifted from technical to human-oriented aspects. Building    on this analysis we designed, implemented, and deployed a system    comprising a web application to test user awareness about phishing,    featuring a survey to identify the most interesting characteristics of    users, and fueled by a large and varied set of test emails engineered to    solicit the several possible cognitive vulnerabilities we all have. We    describe in details the design and implementation choices, the lessons    we learned, and the way we filled the gap in the available related work.    Finally, we use real data from our first 500 users to show how data    collected can be used for several important analyses, including which    characteristics of the emails are more relevant for which cognitive    vulnerability of specific groups of users. Results obtained can guide    the development of novel email clients as well as tailored training    programmes.

Third, we demonstrate how to    exfiltrate the private key, based on proprietary mailto parameters    implemented by various email clients. An evaluation shows that 8 out of    20 tested email clients are vulnerable to at least one attack.

Sophisticated attackers can craft highly-targeted    attachments, using publicly available information about potential    victims to create convincing documents that contain hidden malicious    payloads. Users who open these attachments using vulnerable applications    are at a high risk of infection. Unfortunately, current mitigations are    unreliable, relying either on fallible malware detection techniques or    user education. In this work, we propose adopting a default policy of    isolated attachment rendering. Emails bearing attachments are    transparently rewritten (in a sandboxed virtual machine environment) to    contain static renderings of the attachments. Users who wish to obtain    the original attachment are explicitly warned of the dangers of doing so    - akin to TLS warnings as used in web browsers - before being allowed to    access the requested documents.

IEEE,EmailCloak: A Practical and Flexible Approach to Improve Email Privacy,,2015,,,242-250,,"Millions of users rely on email providers to manage and store their    personal communications. This vast amount of private information,    however, is often misused not only by adversaries, but also by the    providers themselves. End-to-end email encryption is considered the most    robust defense against this threat; however, its many requirements make    this approach impractical for protecting everyday emails. In this paper,    we present EmailCloak, an email alias service with public key encryption    capabilities. EmailCloak relaxes email encryption requirements by    relying on a privacy-respecting third-party. Emails sent and received by    the user are automatically encrypted with her public key by EmailCloak    before being forwarded to, and stored by her email provider. This    approach, while seemingly straightforward, offers multiple benefits:    simplified key management, selective and automatic encryption, advanced    deployment options and transparency towards other parties. Moreover, our    experimental evaluation shows that the overhead introduced by EmailCloak    is adequate for email communications. We have also made our    implementation publicly available.

IEEE,Email Spoofing Detection Using Volatile Memory Forensics,,2017,,,619-625,,"In email systems, one of the most widely used attacks is email spoofing,    in which the source address of the email message is forged to make the    recipient of the email believe that the email was sent from a legitimate    source. Several research works have been presented in the past to    address email spoofing attack. Further, in recent years, the technique    of memory forensics has evolved significantly where critical evidence is    extracted from the volatile memory of the target machine during a cyber    crime investigation. In this paper, we utilize memory forensics to    detect if the client received any spoofed email. In addition, our memory    forensics approach detects if the client replied to any spoofed emails.    The memory of the client machine is acquired on a scheduled basis and    the acquired memory dump is analyzed to identify spoofing attack and, if    detected, storing the details in log files that can be used by cyber    crime investigators. The benefit of applying memory forensics to detect    spoofed emails is that it guarantees non-repudiation since every action    performed on a computer is loaded in the system's physical memory,    including email communication, and hence the user cannot deny receiving    or replying to spoofed email.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Iyer, RP (Corresponding Author), SUNY Albany, Albany, NY 12222 USA.

USENIX Assoc,Why TLS is better without STARTTLS: A Security Analysis of STARTTLS in    the Email Context,,2021,,BS4QP,4365-4382,,"TLS is one of today's most widely used and best-analyzed encryption    technologies. However, for historical reasons, TLS for email protocols    is often not used directly but negotiated via STARTTLS. This additional    negotiation adds complexity and was prone to security vulnerabilities    such as naive STARTTLS stripping or command injection attacks in the    past.    We perform the first structured analysis of STARTTLS in SMTP, POP3, and    IMAP and introduce EAST, a semiautomatic testing toolkit with more than    100 test cases covering a wide range of variants of STARTTLS stripping,    command and response injections, tampering attacks, and UI spoofing    attacks for email protocols. Our analysis focuses on the confidentiality    and integrity of email submission (email client to SMTP server) and    email retrieval (email client to POP3 or IMAP server). While some of our    findings are also relevant for email transport (from one SMTP server to    another), the security implications in email submission and retrieval    are more critical because these connections involve not only individual    email messages but also user credentials that allow access to a user's    email archive.    We used EAST to analyze 28 email clients and 23 servers. In total, we    reported over 40 STARTTLS issues, some of which allow mailbox spoofing,    credential stealing, and even the hosting of HTTPS with a cross-protocol    attack on IMAP. We conducted an Internet-wide scan for the particularly    dangerous command injection attack and found that 320.000 email servers    (2\% of all email servers) are affected. Surprisingly, several clients    were vulnerable to STARTTLS stripping attacks. In total, only 3 out of    28 clients did not show any STARTTLS-specific security issues. Even    though the command injection attack received multiple CVEs in the past,    EAST detected eight new instances of this problem. In total, only 7 out    of 23 tested servers were never affected by this issue. We conclude that    STARTTLS is error-prone to implement, under-specified in the standards,    and should be avoided.",USENIX ASSOC,"SUITE 215, 2560 NINTH ST, BERKELEY, CA 94710 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Ising, F (Corresponding Author), Munster Univ Appl Sci, Munster, Germany.

IEEE,A Layered Approach to Defending Against List-Linking Email Bombs,,2018,,,26-34,,"Email bombing is a form of Denial of Service (DoS) attack that consists    of sending huge volumes of email to one or more email addresses to    overflow the mailbox or overwhelm the server where the mailbox is    hosted. While this type of attack is not new, we have seen renewed    Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks by email in the past few    years via list-linking attacks, where the victim's email address is    subscribed to thousands or even tens of thousands of mailing lists. We    describe some of the measures that list owners and email service    providers have suggested to mitigate such attacks. We then present a    case study of a real-world attack, investigating whether characteristics    of attack behavior and email attributes surface a workable hypothesis of    early detection paradigms. We test our hypothesis on a dataset of    hundreds of millions of emails, representing three months of data from    3,000 medium and large organizations. Our technique helped us detect    three previously unknown list-linking attacks in the dataset. We    determined that anomalous bursts signify meaningful patterns at the user    level, but cannot be extrapolated effectively when analyzing bulk    enterprise volume data. Effective spam identification in this case needs    to consider the unique nature of the messages in the attack, which lends    to their exhibiting linguistic similarities, combined with their    temporal proximity. We recommend a layered approach to detection and    throttling through per-user volume and time-based methodologies paired    with phrasal pattern recognition.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Houle, C (Corresponding Author), Forcepoint, Forcepoint Secur Labs, San Diego, CA USA.

This not only allows users    to authenticate each other via shared low-entropy secrets, e.g.,    memorable words, without a public key infrastructure or a trusted third    party, but it also paves the way for automation and a series of    cryptographic enhancements; improves security by minimizing the impact    of human error and potentially improves usability. First, we study a few    vulnerabilities in voice-based out-of-band authentication, in particular    a combinatorial attack against lazy users, which we analyze in the    context of a secure email solution. Next, we propose solving the problem    of secure equality test using PAKE to achieve entity authentication and    to establish a shared high-entropy secret key. Our solution lends itself    to offline settings, compatible with the inherently asynchronous nature    of email and modern messaging systems. The suggested approach enables    enhancements in key management such as automated key renewal and future    key pair authentications, multi-device synchronization, secure secret    storage and retrieval, and the possibility of post-quantum security as    well as facilitating forward secrecy and deniability in a primarily    symmetric-key setting.

IEEE,Developing Recommender Systems for Personalized Email with Big Data,,2016,,,77-82,,"Recommender systems are nowadays widely used in e-commerce industry to    boost its sale. One of the popular algorithms in recommender systems is    collaborative filtering. The fundamental assumption behind this    algorithm is that other users' opinions can be filtered and accumulated    in such a way as to provide a plausible prediction of the target user's    preference. In this paper, we would like to develop a recommender system    with big data of one e-commerce company and deliver the recommendations    through a personalized email. To address this problem, we propose    user-based collaboration filter based on company dataset and employ    several similarity functions: Euclidean distance, Cosine, Pearson    correlation and Tanimoto coefficient. The experimental results show    that: (i) user responses are positive to the given recommendations based    on user perception survey (ii) Tanimoto coefficient with 10 neighbors    shows the best performance in the RMSE, precision and recall evaluation    based on groundtruth dataset.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Gunawan, AAS (Corresponding Author), Bina Nusantara Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Math Dept, Jakarta, Indonesia.

ACM,Comprehensive Method for Detecting Phishing Emails Using    Correlation-based Analysis and User Participation,,2017,,,155-157,,"Phishing email has become a popular solution among attackers to steal    all kinds of data from people and easily breach organizations' security    system. Hackers use multiple techniques and tricks to raise the chances    of success of their attacks, like using information found on social    networking websites to tailor their emails to the target's interests, or    targeting employees of an organization who probably can't spot a    phishing email or malicious websites and avoid sending emails to IT    people or employees from Security department. In this paper we focus on    analyzing the coherence of information contained in the different parts    of the email: Header, Body, and URLs. After analyzing multiple phishing    emails we discovered that there is always incoherence between these    different parts. We created a comprehensive method which uses a set of    rules that correlates the information collected from analyzing the    header, body and URLs of the email and can even include the user in the    detection process. We take into account that there is no such thing    called perfection, so even if an email is classified as legitimate, our    system will still send a warning to the user if the email is suspicious    enough.

This work takes a different    approach, applying computational cognitive modelling to research the    decision-making of cybersecurity users. The model described here relies    on cognitive memory chunk activation to analytically simulate the    decision-making process of a user classifying legitimate and phishing    emails. Suspicious-seeming cues in each email are processed by examining    similar, past classifications in long-term memory. We manipulate five    parameters (Suspicion Threshold, Maximum Cues Processed, Weight of    Similarity, Flawed Perception Level, Legitimate-to-Phishing Email Ratio    in long-term memory) to examine their effects on accuracy, email    processing time and decision confidence. Furthermore, we have conducted    an empirical, unattended study of US participants performing the same    task. Analyses on the empirical study data and simulation output,    especially clustering analysis, show that these two research approaches    complement each other for more insightful understanding of this phishing    detection task.

IEEE,Establishing Email-based Social Network Trust for Vehicular Networks,,2010,,BRI28,849+,,"We propose a vehicular network trust model that integrates    cryptography-based entity trust and email-based social trust. The entity    trust provides security protections such as origin integrity, data    integrity, and confidentiality. The social trust provides a level of    belief on the data transmitted by an entity. To achieve the email-based    social trust, we require each user to run an automated agent that    performs trust evaluation checks and processes trust checking requests.    The requests are from their highly trusted contacts or through a trusted    proxy server maintained by the email service provider. We utilize    identity-based cryptography (IBC) to integrate entity trust and social    trust. This allows us to use a unique identity (e.g., an email address)    for each entity.

With the expansion of web services, denial of service (DoS)    attacks by malicious automated programs (e. g. web bots) is becoming a    serious problem of web service accounts. In order to avoid tremendous    attack from malicious computer programs, HIP, or Human Interactive    Proofs has been introduced to distinguish humans from computers. HIPs    are designed to be easy for humans but hard for machines. Unfortunately,    the existing HIPs tried to maximize the difficulty for automated    programs to pass tests by increasing distortion or noise.

Defense against such    attacks, therefore, requires realizing defense along both technological    and human vectors. Security hardening research work along the    technological vector is few and focuses mainly on the use of machine    learning and natural language processing to distinguish between machine-    and human-generated text. Common existing approaches to harden security    along the human vector consist of third-party organized training    programmes, the content of which needs to be updated over time. There    is, to date, no reported approach that provides both phishing attack    detection and progressive end-user training. In this paper, we present    our contribution, which includes the design and development of an    integrated approach that employs AI-assisted and generative AI platforms    for phishing attack detection and continuous end-user education in a    hybrid security framework. This framework supports scenario-customizable    and evolving user education in dealing with increasingly advanced    phishing email attacks. The technological design and functional details    for both platforms are presented and discussed. Performance tests showed    that the phishing attack detection sub-system using the Convolutional    Neural Network (CNN) deep learning model architecture achieved the best    overall results: above 94\% accuracy, above 95\% precision, and above    94\% recall.",MDPI,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Article,English,"Loh, PKK (Corresponding Author), Singapore Inst Technol, 172 Ang Mo Kio Ave 8, Singapore 567739, Singapore.

In this paper, we    present a behavior- and time-feature-based email classification method.    Based on email logs, email social networks are built through the    extraction of entities and relations from the email records using the    MapReduce model. By combining behavior features from social networks and    time features from email sending intervals, we adopt a Support Vector    Machine based classifier to identify spammers and non-spammers. Compared    with the current email classification methods, the advantages of our    method are: (1) in addition to the behavior-based features, our method    integrates the time feature to facilitate email classification; (2) to    efficiently handle the vast number of emails, we employ the MapReduce    model to extract the behavior- and time-based features on the email    social network. Experiments on real email data of three years show that    the proposed method achieves better classification accuracy.","LIBRARY \& INFORMATION CENTER, NAT DONG HWA UNIV","LIBRARY \& INFORMATION CENTER, NAT DONG HWA UNIV, HUALIEN, 00000, TAIWAN",Article,English,"Shi, Q (Corresponding Author), Nantong Univ, Sch Transportat, Nantong, Peoples R China.

USENIX,FakeBehalf: Imperceptible Email Spoofing Attacks against the Delegation    Mechanism in Email Systems,,2024,,,1243-1260,,"Email has become an essential service for global communication. In email    protocols, a Delegation Mechanism allows emails to be sent by other    entities on behalf of the email author. Specifically, the Sender field    indicates the agent for email delivery (i.e., the Delegate). Despite    well-implemented security extensions (e.g., DKIM, DMARC) that validate    the authenticity of email authors, vulnerabilities in the Delegation    Mechanism can still be exploited to bypass these security measures with    well-crafted spoofing emails.    This paper systematically analyzes the security vulnerabilities within    the Delegation Mechanism. Due to the absence of validation for the    Sender field, adversaries can arbitrarily fabricate this field, thus    spoofing the Delegate presented to email recipients. Our observations    reveal that emails with a spoofed Sender field can pass authentications    and reach the inboxes of all target providers. We also conduct a user    study with 50 participants to assess the recipients' comprehension of    spoofed Delegates, finding that 50\% are susceptible to deceiving    Delegate information. Furthermore, we propose novel email spoofing    attacks where adversaries can impersonate arbitrary entities as email    authors to craft highly deceptive emails while passing security    extensions. We assess their impact across 16 service providers and 20    clients, observing that half of the providers and all clients are    vulnerable to the discovered attacks. To mitigate the threats within the    Delegation Mechanism, we propose a validation scheme to verify the    authenticity of the Sender field, along with design suggestions to    enhance the security of email clients.",USENIX ASSOC,"SUITE 215, 2560 NINTH ST, BERKELEY, CA 94710 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Xue, KP (Corresponding Author), Univ Sci \& Technol China, Hefei 230052, Peoples R China.

This raises the main question    of which construct (user vulnerabilities or phisher skills) has a    greater influence on the vulnerable user. Researchers have provided    enough evidence of user vulnerabilities, namely the desire for monetary    gain, curiosity of the computer user, carelessness on the part of the    user, the trust placed in the purported sender by the user, and a lack    of awareness on the part of the computer user. However, there is a lack    of research on the magnitude of each of these factors in influencing an    unsuspecting user to fall for a phishing or spear phishing attack which    we explored in this paper. While user vulnerabilities pose major risk,    the effect of the spear phisher's ability in skillfully crafting    convincing emails (using fear appeals, urgency of action, and email    contextualization) to trap even skillful IT security personnel is an    area that needs to be explored. Therefore, we explored the relationships    between the two major constructs namely `user vulnerabilities' and    `email contextualization', through the theory of planned behavior with    the objective to find out the major factors that lead to computer users    biting the phishers' bait.

Assoc Comp Machinery,"``Wait, Do I Know This Person?{''}: Understanding Misdirected Email",,2019,,,,,"Email is an essential tool for communication and social interaction. It    also functions as a broadcast medium connecting businesses with their    customers, as an authentication mechanism, and as a vector for scams and    security threats. These uses are enabled by the fact that the only    barrier to reaching someone by email is knowing his or her email    address. This feature has given rise to the spam email industry but also    has another side-effect that is becoming increasingly common:    misdirected email, or legitimate emails that are intended for somebody    else but are sent to the wrong recipient. In this paper we present    findings from an interview study and survey focusing on characteristics    of misdirected email messages, possible reasons why they happen, and how    people manage these messages when they receive them. Misdirected email    arises as a result of signifiers (usernames) which were selected by    people for social and self-representation purposes, that are also used    by machines for addressing.

Communication by regular email is, however, considered a    security threat in many countries and is not recommended. Systems which    offer secure communication have now emerged. Unlike regular email,    secure systems require that users authenticate themselves. However, the    authentication steps per se may become barriers that reduce use.    Objectives: The objective was to study the experiences of patients who    were using a secure electronic communication system. The focus of the    study was the users' privacy versus the usability of the system.    Methods: Qualitative interviews were conducted with 15 patients who used    a secure communication system (MedAxess) to exchange personal health    information with their primary care physician.    Results: Six main themes were identified from the interviews: (1)    supporting simple questions, (2) security issues, (3) aspects of written    communication, (4) trust in the physician, (5) simplicity of MedAxess,    and (6) trouble using the system. By using the system, about half of the    patients (8/15) experienced easier access to their physician, with whom    they tended to solve minor health problems and elaborate on more complex    illness experiences. Two thirds of the respondents (10/15) found that    their physician quickly responded to their MedAxess requests. As a    result of the security barriers, the users felt that the system was    secure. However, due to the same barriers, the patients considered the    log-in procedure cumbersome, which had considerable negative impact on    the actual use of the system.    Conclusions: Despite a perceived need for secure electronic    patient-physician communication systems, security barriers may diminish    their overall usefulness. A dual approach is necessary to improve this    situation: patients need to be better informed about security issues,    and, at the same time, their experiences of using secure systems must be    studied and used to improve user interfaces.","JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC","59 WINNERS CIRCLE, TORONTO, ON M4L 3Y7, CANADA",Article,English,"Norwegian Univ Sci \& Technol, Norwegian Res Ctr Elect Patient Records, N-7489 Trondheim, Norway.

In this paper, we studied    the behavioral characteristics of different mal ware types affecting the    Internet and other enterprise email systems. This research was carried    out on spam email data received by a single user's test email account    collected over a period of six months. A sandbox test environment    platform using virtual machines was built to perform this research and    simulate real-life malware behavior and determine its signature at the    point of execution for proper analysis. Analysis of email data using the    sandbox setup helps to produce a comprehensive data analysis about    botnet behavior. We described in detail the design and implementation of    sandbox test environment including the challenges faced in building this    test environment. As a cost saving measure, we used VMware based virtual    platforms built on Linux PC-class hardware. We present results of our    behavioral measurement of the most active botnets. Our study discovered    that for a single email user for a period of six months, two active    Trojans contributed around 20 percent of the total identified malwares    received within this time period and the remaining 80 percent of malware    binaries were distributed over many different types of botnets; the    email malware shows a classic long-tail distribution. During this    experiment, we also discovered very strong polymorphic behaviors    exhibited by these malware samples, ostensibly intended to help the    malware authors and hackers to penetrate and bypass the enterprise    intrusion detection systems.

Women can press the button when    they feel discomfort and activate the system. The system can also be    activated by changes in sensor setup output which is part of the system.    When activated, the system tracks the location of the woman using Global    Positioning System (GPS) sensor and sends an emergency email to the    person who can help or save her. The system also incorporates a    screaming alarm that uses real-time clock, to call out for help.

In recent years, Large Language Models have    improved the potency of email-based attacks by giving attackers an    easy-to-use tool to overcome the language barrier and craft believable    emails. At the same time, Business Email Compromise research remains    hamstrung by the lack of a publicly available dataset. This paper    proposes a novel system composed of Large Language Models to create    Business Email Compromise datasets. Two datasets are generated. The    first one (BEC-1) is a small 20-email proof-of-concept dataset that    demonstrates that the system produces a dataset that a human analyst    finds credible. The second (BEC-2) is a larger 279-email dataset    generated using the same system. BEC-2 is the first public Business    Email Compromise dataset available to the email security research    community. The paper also proposes an accuracy-like metric called    ``agreement score{''} to measure the quality of datasets produced.

Forty-three percent of users fell for the simulated phishing emails,    with older women showing the highest susceptibility. While    susceptibility in young users declined across the study, susceptibility    in older users remained stable. The relative effectiveness of the    attacks differed by weapons of influence and life domains with age-group    variability.

PACIS,Studying Users' Computer Security Behavior Using the Health Belief Model,,2007,,,,,"The increasing frequency of security incidents is a major concern to    organizations, and it is therefore important for organizations to    protect themselves against security threats. Technological controls are    important but not adequate, as the success of security also depends on    the effective security behavior of individuals. Information security    awareness programs are an important approach but such programs have to    be effective in influencing user's behavior. It is thus important to    investigate the factors that will influence a user to practice computer    security in the context of an organization. With such motivation in mind    this study uses the Health Belief Model, a well-established model from    preventive healthcare, to study users' computer security behavior. An    instrument was developed based on health and security literature and    conceptually validated. Data was collected from 134 employees of    different organizations and analyzed using multiple regression analysis.    Results show that perceived susceptibility. perceived benefits and    self-efficacy are determinants of a user's computer security behavior    when applied to exercising care with email attachments.

USENIX ASSOC,``I don't know why I check this ... `` - Investigating Expert Users'    Strategies to Detect Email Signature Spoofing Attacks,,2022,,BX6CS,77-96,,"OpenPGP is one of the two major standards for end-to-end email security.    Several studies showed that serious usability issues exist with tools    implementing this standard. However, a widespread assumption is that    expert users can handle these tools and detect signature spoofing    attacks. We present a user study investigating expert users' strategies    to detect signature spoofing attacks in Thunderbird. We observed 25    expert users while they classified eight emails as either having a    legitimate signature or not. Studying expert users explicitly gives us    an upper bound of attack detection rates of all users dealing with PGP    signatures. 52\% of participants fell for at least one out of four    signature spoofing attacks. Overall, participants did not have an    established strategy for evaluating email signature legitimacy. We    observed our participants apply 23 different types of checks when    inspecting signed emails, but only 8 of these checks tended to be useful    in identifying the spoofed or invalid signatures. In performing their    checks, participants were frequently startled, confused, or annoyed with    the user interface, which they found supported them little. All these    results paint a clear picture: Even expert users struggle to verify    email signatures, usability issues in email security are not limited to    novice users, and developers may need proper guidance on implementing    email signature GUIs correctly.",USENIX ASSOC,"SUITE 215, 2560 NINTH ST, BERKELEY, CA 94710 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Mayer, P (Corresponding Author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, SECUSO Secur Usabil Soc, Karlsruhe, Germany.

The proposed approach exploits an authorship    technique based on the analysis of the author's writing style. The    problem has been studied under two viewpoints, i.e. the typical sender    verification viewpoint, already exploited in previous works, and the    sender-receiver interaction verification, which to the best of our    knowledge is a novel approach. Hence, we introduced the concept of    end-to-end email authorship verification, which is focused on the    analysis of the sender-receiver interactions. The proposed method    implements a binary classification exploiting both standard machine    learning classifiers based on the well-known text stylometric features    and deep learning classifiers based on the automatic feature extraction    phase. We have used a well-known email dataset, i.e. the Enron dataset    to benchmark our approach, with the experiments showing an authorship    verification accuracy reaching 99\% and 93\% respectively for the sender    and the end to end verification scenarios.

IEEE,Email as a Master Key: Analyzing Account Recovery in the Wild,,2018,,,1646-1654,,"Account recovery (usually through a password reset) on many websites has    mainly relied on accessibility to a registered email due to its    favorable deployability and usability. However, it makes a user's online    accounts vulnerable to a single point of failure when the registered    email account is compromised. While previous research focuses on    strengthening user passwords, the security risk imposed by email-based    account recovery has not yet been well studied. In this paper, we    investigate the possibility of mounting an email-based account recovery    attack. Specifically, we examine the account authentication and recovery    protocols in 239 traffic-heavy websites, confirming that most of them    use emails for account recovery. We further scrutinize the security    policy of major email service providers and show that a significant    portion of them take no or marginal effort to protect user email    accounts, leaving compromised email accounts readily available for    mounting account recovery attacks. Then, we conduct case studies to    assess potential losses caused by such attacks. Finally, we propose a    lightweight email security enhancement called Secure Email Account    Recovery (SEAR) to defend against account recovery attacks as an extra    layer of protection to account recovery emails.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Li, Y (Corresponding Author), Coll William \& Mary, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.

IEEE,A Secure Web Email System Based on IBC,,2017,,,578-581,,"Email clients supporting encryption and signature are mostly based on    the PKI (public key infrastructure) system, and users need their own    digital certificates to send secure mails. This leads to a series of    complicated operation problems with digital certificates. IBC    (Identity-based cryptography) is an asymmetric algorithm, with the    user's unique identity information and a set of public parameters    combined as a public key. It avoids the problems with PKI and is a good    substitute for PKI. However, current standard applications including    email clients do not support IBC algorithm. In this work, we use    pseudo-RSA digital certificate technology to bridge the gap. The    technology stores an IBC key in an RSA certificate structure, generates    secure email in SMIME format, making the resulted email compatible with    SMIME enabled software.

IEEE,Towards Designing An Email Classification System Using Multi-View Based    Semi-Supervised Learning,,2014,,,174-181,,"The goal of email classification is to classify user emails into spam    and legitimate ones. Many supervised learning algorithms have been    invented in this domain to accomplish the task, and these algorithms    require a large number of labeled training data. However, data labeling    is a labor intensive task and requires in-depth domain knowledge. Thus,    only a very small proportion of the data can be labeled in practice.    This bottleneck greatly degrades the effectiveness of supervised email    classification systems. In order to address this problem, in this work,    we first identify some critical issues regarding supervised machine    learning-based email classification. Then we propose an effective    classification model based on multi-view disagreement-based    semi-supervised learning. The motivation behind the attempt of using    multi-view and semi-supervised learning is that multi-view can provide    richer information for classification, which is often ignored by    literature, and semi-supervised learning supplies with the capability of    coping with labeled and unlabeled data. In the evaluation, we    demonstrate that the multi-view data can improve the email    classification than using a single view data, and that the proposed    model working with our algorithm can achieve better performance as    compared to the existing similar algorithms.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Meng, WZ (Corresponding Author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Comp Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

USENIX Assoc,End-to-End Measurements of Email Spoofing Attacks,,2018,,,1095-1112,,"Spear phishing has been a persistent threat to users and organizations,    and yet email providers still face key challenges to authenticate    incoming emails. As a result, attackers can apply spoofing techniques to    impersonate a trusted entity to conduct highly deceptive phishing    attacks. In this work, we study email spoofing to answer three key    questions: (1) How do email providers detect and handle forged emails?    (2) Under what conditions can forged emails penetrate the defense to    reach user inbox? (3) Once the forged email gets in, how email providers    warn users? Is the warning truly effective?    We answer these questions by conducting an end-toend measurement on 35    popular email providers and examining user reactions to spoofing through    a real-world spoofing/phishing test. Our key findings are three folds.    First, we observe that most email providers have the necessary protocols    to detect spoofing, but still allow forged emails to reach the user    inbox (e.g., Yahoo Mail, iCloud, Gmail). Second, once a forged email    gets in, most email providers have no warning for users, particularly    for mobile email apps. Some providers (e.g., Gmail Inbox) even have    misleading UIs that make the forged email look authentic. Third, a few    email providers (9/35) have implemented visual security indicators on    unverified emails. Our phishing experiment shows that security    indicators have a positive impact on reducing risky user actions, but    cannot eliminate the risk. Our study reveals a major miscommunication    between email providers and end-users. Improvements at both ends    (server-side protocols and UIs) are needed to bridge the gap.",USENIX ASSOC,"SUITE 215, 2560 NINTH ST, BERKELEY, CA 94710 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Hu, H (Corresponding Author), Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.

In order to understand    security implication of the structures and analyze any possible    vulnerabilities of MUA programs, in this paper, we investigated    practical MUAs supporting e-mail encryption. As a result, we found    severe vulnerabilities in a list of MUAs that allow cache side-channel    attacks in virtualized desktop environments. Our analysis reveals that    the root cause originates from the lack of verification and control over    third-party cryptographic libraries they adopt.

IEEE,Confidante: Usable Encrypted Email A Case Study With Lawyers and    Journalists,,2017,,,385-400,,"Email encryption tools remain underused, even by people who frequently    conduct sensitive business over email, such as lawyers and journalists.    Usable encrypted email has remained out of reach largely because key    management and verification remain difficult. However, key management    has evolved in the age of social media: Keybase is a service that allows    users to cryptographically link public keys to their social media    accounts (e.g., Twitter), enabling key trust without out-of-band    communication. We design and prototype Confidante, an encrypted email    client that uses Keybase for automatic key management. We conduct a user    study with 15 people (8 U.S. lawyers and 7 U.S. journalists) to evaluate    Confidante's design decisions. We find that users complete an encrypted    email task more quickly and with fewer errors using Confidante than with    an existing email encryption tool, and that many users report finding    Confidante comparable to using ordinary email. However, we also find    that lawyers and journalists have diverse operational constraints and    threat models, and thus that there may not be a one-size-fits-all    solution to usable encrypted email. We reflect on our findings-both    specifically about Confidante and more generally about the needs and    constraints of lawyers and journalists-to identify lessons and remaining    security and usability challenges for encrypted email.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Lerner, A (Corresponding Author), Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.

IEEE,Your Email Address Holds the Key: Understanding the Connection Between    Email and Password Security with Deep Learning,,2023,,BV4QN,94-104,,"In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of deep-learning-based    password guessing models for targeted attacks on human-chosen passwords.    In recent years, service providers have increased the level of security    of users' passwords. This is done by requiring more complex password    generation patterns and by using computationally expensive hash    functions. For the attackers this means a reduced number of available    guessing attempts, which introduces the necessity to target their guess    by exploiting a victim's publicly available information. In this work,    we introduce a contextaware password guessing model that better capture    attackers' behavior. We demonstrate that knowing a victim's email    address is already critical in compromising the associated password and    provide an in-depth analysis of the relationship between them. We also    show the potential of such models to identify clusters of users based on    their password generation behaviour, which can spot fake profiles and    populations more vulnerable to context-aware guesses.

"Filiol, Eric and Dechaux, Jonathan and Fizaine, Jean-Paul",Perverting eMails: A new Dimension in Internet (in) Security,,2011,,,91-105,,"Electronic mail (or email) has not just changed the way we communicate    in our daily life; it has transformed the way we do business today.    Considered a convenient, powerful and a low cost tool, it is widely used    to convey all kind of information including -unfortunately - sensitive    or confidential information such as passwords, personal data, and    private information. In recent times, two emerging technologies,    referred to as the cloud computing and browser-based email technologies,    have gained popularity among users and, along the way, also added a new    significant layer of risk: It is common practice now from users to store    their passwords into email folders and even worse, most of those    browsers store and remember your password to open your email account    automatically. Let's imagine the consequences of an attack launched by    cybercriminals designed to resend and divert the original    functionalities and features inherent to the browser for any malicious    purpose, or worse - terrorist attempts. Let's take for example a US    military officer operating in a country at war such as Afghanistan    simply sending emails to his family to keep in touch with them. Whenever    he sends an email, thousands of emails containing racial slurs against    Muslim people are automatically sent to Afghan troops from his web    account without him knowing it. The consequences of such an action would    be unquestionably devastating. This above example, though fictitious,    illustrates how efficient this kind of emails could be for both war    propaganda and deception operations against US troops. Now imagine a    company `s decision maker who daily exchanges large amounts of emails    containing sensitive or confidential information within and outside his    company ranging from trade secrets, contracts details, customer lists,    research reports, financial information to staff's personal details.    Modifying the browser-based email technology could enable any    ill-intended person to wiretap and to eavesdrop any email directly at    the browser's level to record any sent data and to make them evade from    the computer towards unscrupulous people. The collection of the daily    flow of emails, both internally and externally, definitely provides a    snapshot of a company's overall culture and is proving to be a powerful    and efficient tool used for both industrial and economic espionage. As a    last example, these technologies once modified, could be used to set up    thousand of zombies in mail clients. For that purpose, a large number of    email clients would simultaneously send thousands of mails to a single    target - e.g. an email server - to deny mail service for a limited    period of time. We can easily imagine that this kind of attack launched    on any stock exchange computer systems would entail damaging economic    repercussions for the affected country and would probably plunge it into    chaos for some time. In this paper, we will explain and show that email    can be used as a ideal weapon for terrorism, cyber warfare, espionage,    denial of service and can cripple all sectors of economy and nation    states. We will address these issues both at the technical and    operational level.

However,    especially with the continuously evolving threat landscape, one cannot    assume that users are always motivated to learn about Information    Security and practice it. Actually, there are situations of an aware    user who knows how to protect himself but, simply, chooses not to,    because they do not care, usability problems or because they do not    consider themselves as targets. Thus, understanding human security    behavior is vital for ensuring an efficient Information Security    environment that cannot depend on technology only. Although a number of    psychological theories and models, such as Protection Motivation Theory    and Technology Acceptance Model, were used in the literature to    interpret these behaviors, they tend to assess users' intensions rather    than actual behavior. The aim of this paper is to understand and assess    these behaviors from a holistic view by finding the significant factors    that influence them and how to best assist users to protect themselves.    To accomplish this, a systematic literature review was conducted where    relevant literature was sought in a number of academic digital    databases. As a result, several key behavioral influencers were    identified to be essential to consider when educating and directing    users' security behavior. Further to that, a number of Information    Security awareness approaches were proposed that may transform the user    from being ill-informed into a securityminded user who is able to make    an informed decision.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Alohali, M (Corresponding Author), Plymouth Univ, Ctr Secur Commun \& Network Res, Plymouth, Devon, England.

IEEE,A Decentralized Secure Email System based on Conventional RSA Signature,,2020,,,494-498,,"Recently, many users have been attacked by phishing or targeted    malicious email, and thus email has become completely untrustworthy. So    we gradually need to make email communications more secure. Of course,    we can digitally sign, encrypt and decrypt emails by secure email    systems such as S/MIME and PGP, which are two standards developed for    that purpose. However, these two systems are seldom used and then have    some drawbacks: the trust mode of PGP is only suitable for small-scaled    organizations, and S/MIME cannot run away from the troubling operations    such as the certificate application. In this paper, we propose a    decentralized and large-scaled secure email system using conventional    RSA signature embedding ID (e.g., email address), which is used in the    communication scene among unspecified multi-organization. More    importantly, our system needs neither a public key certificate nor    voucher (e.g., CA or trusted user) for mail security by employing the    new type of ``key trust level{''}. Since the reliability of email is    decided by user itself rather than is decided by other vouchers, we can    say that our system is truly decentralized.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Omote, K (Corresponding Author), Univ Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.

The existing methods for the Spam and    Phishing detection are based on blacklisting and heuristics technique.    These methods require human intervention to update if any new Spam and    Phishing activity occurs. Moreover, these are completely inefficient in    detecting new Spam and Phishing activities. These techniques can detect    malicious activity only after the attack has occurred. Machine learning    has the capability to detect new Spam and Phishing activities. This    requires extensive domain knowledge for feature learning and feature    representation. Deep learning is a method of machine learning which has    the capability to extract optimal feature representation from various    samples of benign, Spam and Phishing activities by itself. To leverage,    this work uses various deep learning architectures for both Spam and    Phishing detection with electronic mail (Email) and uniform resource    locator (URL) data sources. Because in recent years both Email and URL    resources are the most commonly used by the attackers to spread malware.    Various datasets are used for conducting experiments with deep learning    architectures. For comparative study, classical machine learning    algorithms are used. These datasets are collected using public and    private data sources. All experiments are run till 1,000 epochs with    varied learning rate 0.01-0.5. For comparative study various classical    machine learning classifiers are used with domain level feature    extraction. For deep learning architectures and classical machine    learning algorithms to convert text data into numeric representation    various natural language processing text representation methods are    used. As far as anyone is concerned, this is the first attempt, a    framework that can examine and connect the occasions of Spam and    Phishing activities from Email and URL sources at scale to give cyber    threat situational awareness. The created framework is exceptionally    versatile and fit for distinguishing the malicious activities in close    constant. In addition, the framework can be effectively reached out to    deal with vast volume of other cyber security events by including extra    resources. These qualities havemade the proposed framework emerge from    some other arrangement of comparative kind.",SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",Article; Book Chapter,English,"Vinayakumar, R (Corresponding Author), Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amrita Sch Engn, Ctr Computat Engn \& Networking CEN, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India.

Thus, common    anti-phishing advice is to check a link's URL before clicking, but email    clients do not support this well. Automated phishing detection enables    email clients to warn users that an email is suspicious, but current    warnings are often not specific. We evaluated the effects on phishing    susceptibility of (1) moving phishing warnings close to the suspicious    link in the email, (2) displaying the warning on hover interactions with    the link, and (3) forcing attention to the warning by deactivating the    original link, forcing users to click the URL in the warning. We    assessed the effectiveness of such link-focused phishing warning designs    in a between-subjects online experiment (n=701). We found that    link-focused phishing warnings reduced phishing click-through rates    compared to email banner warnings; forced attention warnings were most    effective.

The    specific aim of this research was to test the feasibility of an email    device called MIVO for use in interacting with women and children after    receiving PFA. This qualitative design used a three-step recruitment,    screening and email interaction with mothers and their adolescent child    after obtaining informed consent and training in the use of an email    device. Sample included six pairs of mother and child (n = 12) who have    received a PFA within the past 6 months. Demographic data were gathered    using the sociodemographic questionnaire. Qualitative data were gathered    using email messages from mother and child pairs. Results showed that    email interaction is a feasible and acceptable way of providing support    and information to survivors of abuse after their PFA. The following    themes in their order and rank of appearance were found in the email    interaction between the nurse and survivors: (1) safety issues; (2)    job-related issues; (3) school-related issues; (4) parenting-related    issues; and (5) health-related issues. Themes identified for the    children were school work and friends. Privacy, confidentiality and    respect for individual rights are paramount in email interactions. Email    interaction is useful in education, screening, safety instructions and    follow-up care. Technological devices such as MIVO may have usefulness    as an email interaction device among women, their child and a nurse to    reduce their risk for further interpersonal violence/abuse and to    increase disclosure of abuse.

In this article, we present an approach that we developed and    illustrate how it was used to elicit user feedback of the    AnalyzeMyVariant tool, which enables geneticists to use family pedigree    data to calculate pathogenicity likelihood ratios for variants of    unknown significance.    We reviewed existing usability literature and developed a survey    instrument emphasizing concepts of importance to online, data-driven,    scientific tools. The items on the survey instrument were grouped in    four categories: usability, quality, privacy and security, and    satisfaction. We performed a two-part evaluation using the survey and a    semi-structured interview protocol. The survey instrument was used to    collect data about the use experience of AnalyzeMyVariant from 57    genetic experts and trainees who were recruited via email invitations.    We also conducted semi-structured interviews with six genetics experts    to explore work contexts in which users might use the tool and further    delve into issues faced in tool use. Interviews were inductively coded    and major themes identified using the constant comparative method. We    found that the needs of genetics professionals vary for research- and    clinically-focused work. These differences can inform the design of    tools to serve their needs.    The major contribution of this work is the description of a two-part    method to elicit user feedback to inform the design of online,    data-driven, scientific tools, which focuses on constructs of particular    relevance to these tools such as usability, quality, privacy, security,    and satisfaction. The survey instrument that we developed, coupled with    contextual interviews, may serve as an example that can be used by    others conducting usability studies of similar tools. In addition, our    results emphasize the importance of considering contextual factors such    as background knowledge, situational factors, and the intended    application of results, in the usability evaluation of scientific    software.

ACM,``We've Disabled MFA for You{''}: An Evaluation of the Security and    Usability of Multi-Factor Authentication Recovery Deployments,,2023,,,3138-3152,,"Multi-Factor Authentication is intended to strengthen the security of    password-based authentication by adding another factor, such as hardware    tokens or one-time passwords using mobile apps.    However, this increased authentication security comes with potential    drawbacks that can lead to account and asset loss. If users lose access    to their additional authentication factors for any reason, they will be    locked out of their accounts. Consequently, services that provide    Multi-Factor Authentication should deploy procedures to allow their    users to recover from losing access to their additional factor that are    both secure and easy-to-use.    In this work, we investigate the security and user experience of    Multi-Factor Authentication recovery procedures, and compare their    deployment to descriptions on help and support pages.    We first evaluate the official help and support pages of 1,303 websites    that provide Multi-Factor Authentication and collect documented    information about their recovery procedures. Second, we select a subset    of 71 websites, create accounts, set up Multi-Factor Authentication, and    perform an in-depth investigation of their recovery procedure security    and user experience.    We find that many websites deploy insecure Multi-Factor Authentication    recovery procedures and allowed us to circumvent and disable    Multi-Factor Authentication when having access to the accounts'    associated email addresses. Furthermore, we commonly observed    discrepancies between our in-depth analysis and the official help and    support pages, implying that information meant to aid users is often    either incorrect or outdated.

"Roman, Rodrigo and Zhou, Hanying and Lopez, Javier",An anti-spam scheme using pre-challenges,COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS,2006,29,15,2739-2749,SEP 5,"Unsolicited Commercial Email, or Spam, is nowadays an increasingly    serious problem to email users. A number of anti-spam schemes have been    proposed in the literature and some of them have been deployed in email    systems, but the problem has yet been well addressed. One of those    schemes is challenge-response, in which a challenge, ranging from a    simple mathematical problem to a hard-AI problem, is imposed on an email    sender in order to forbid machine-based spam reaching receivers'    mailboxes. However, such a scheme introduces new problems for the users,    e.g., delay of service and denial of service. In this paper, we    introduce the pre-challenge scheme, which is based on the    challenge-response mechanism and takes advantage of some features of    email systems. It assumes each user has a challenge that is defined by    the user himself/herself and associated with his/her email address, in    such a way that an email sender can simultaneously retrieve a new    receiver's email address and challenge before sending an email in the    first contact. Some new mechanisms are employed in our scheme to reach a    good balance between security against spam and convenience to normal    email users. Our scheme can be also used for protecting other messaging    systems, like Instant Messaging and Blog comments.

Kong Saoane Thach,User's perception on mental health applications: a qualitative    analysis of user reviews,,2018,,,47-52,,"CBT-based mental health apps have been introduced as a promise in    helping people to deal with common mental illnesses. Although there is a    high number of users, their adherence to the apps is significantly low.    Meanwhile, the reasons for this circumstance are not well examined. The    question of which features engage users to use and continue using are    not well understood. This study will try to address this gap in    literature. The study focuses on apps where the core design is primarily    based on a CBT approach. The review analysis shows that users highly    appreciate the ability to monitor and reflect themselves, and to figure    out what is going on in their mood of the apps. Also, the ability to    send notifications, prompts or email to remind users to perform related    tasks are the helpful way make users stay focused and engaged. Besides,    the ability to provide different interactions for patients and    clinicians is also got high appreciation. Most of design-related    feedback takes careful consideration on ease-of-use characteristics and    research-based features. By contrast, technical issues are the most    common reason making users quit using the interventions. Other aspects    that generate complaints also focus on a lack of customer services,    clear security measures and privacy policy. Similarly, many users    complain when the apps are complicated in design and have a lot of    advertisement contents.

We aim to use these names to    construct security challenges, where users are asked to identify their    real contacts among a presented pool of names. We seek these look-alike    names to preserve name characteristics like gender, ethnicity, and    popularity, while being unlinkable back to the source individual,    thereby making the real contacts not easily guessable by attackers. To    achive this, we introduce the technique of distributed name embeddings,    representing names in a high-dimensional space such that distance    between name components reflects the degree of cultural similarity    between these strings. We present different approaches to construct name    embeddings from contact lists observed at a large web-mail provider, and    evaluate their cultural coherence. We demonstrate that name embeddings    strongly encode gender and ethnicity, as well as name popularity. We    applied this algorithm to generate imitation names in email contact list    challenge. Our controlled user study verified that the proposed    technique reduced the attacker's success rate to 26.08\%,    indistinguishable from random guessing, compared to a success rate of    62.16\% from previous name generation algorithms. Finally, we use these    embeddings to produce an open synthetic name resource of 1 million names    for security applications, constructed to respect both cultural    coherence and U.S. census name frequencies.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Proceedings Paper,English,"Han, SC (Corresponding Author), NEC Labs Amer, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA.

Email repositories are tacit store-houses of knowledge    about people, projects and processes. Mining one's own email repository    can also provide interesting and valuable insights about his or her    engagements and contacts along different dimensions. In this paper, we    propose an email analytics framework that combines text-mining, network    analysis and data analytics principles to mine email repositories for    useful insights. While individuals are more attuned to looking at emails    as individual items along with a history that is embedded in the trail,    mining the whole collection can also lead to knowledge-discovery about    similarities and dissimilarities of different engagements. This in turn    can lead to valuable information like comparative status reports on    various projects or deeper insights about why certain projects succeed    while others don't. Given the volumes, diversity and noisy nature of    e-mails, it becomes impossible for human beings to comprehend the impact    of all of it unless the task is automated and approached in a structured    fashion. We show that combination of text and network analytics along    with temporal reasoning can provide valuable insights about task-states,    actionable items, recommendations and forecasts. These insights can be    exploited very effectively for project-management tasks like automated    identification of bottlenecks or their causes, elimination of    inefficiencies, early-warnings and suggestions about proactive measures    to avoid problems. It is possible to extend the framework quite easily    to analyze multiple email repositories of different users, though this    work does not address the privacy or security concerns that might exist.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Dey, L (Corresponding Author), Tata Consultancy Serv Ltd, TCS Innovat Labs, New Delhi, India.

However, there are also emerging    harmful technologies that pose a threat. Without a doubt, phishing is    one of the rising concerns that leads to stealing vital information such    as passwords, security codes, and personal data from any target node    through communication hijacking techniques. In addition, phishing    attacks include delivering false messages that originate from a trusted    source. Moreover, a phishing attack aims to get the victim to run    malicious programs and reveal confidential data, such as bank    credentials, one-time passwords, and user login credentials. The sole    intention is to collect personal information through malicious    program-based attempts embedded in URLs, emails, and website-based    attempts. Notably, this proposed technique detects URL, email, and    website-based phishing attacks, which will be beneficial and secure us    from scam attempts. Subsequently, the data are pre-processed to identify    phishing attacks using data cleaning, attribute selection, and attacks    detected using machine learning techniques. Furthermore, the proposed    techniques use heuristic-based machine learning to identify phishing    attacks. Admittedly, 56 features are used to analyze URL phishing    findings, and experimental results show that the proposed technique has    a better accuracy of 97.2\%. Above all, the proposed techniques for    email phishing detection obtain a higher accuracy of 97.4\%. In    addition, the proposed technique for website phishing detection has a    better accuracy of 98.1\%, and 48 features are used for analysis.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",Article,English,"Jayaprakash, R (Corresponding Author), Dr Mahalingam Coll Engn \& Technol, Dept Technol, Pollachi, India.

There are several approaches to this task. Lately, those    approaches use convolutional neural networks (CNN). We propose a novel    approach to the image spam classification task. Our approach is based on    CNN and transfer learning, namely Resnet v1 used for semantic feature    extraction and one layer Feedforward Neural Network for classification.    We have shown that this approach can achieve state-of-the-art    performance on publicly available datasets. 99\% F1-score on two    datasets (Dredze et al., 2007), Princeton and 96\% F1-score on the    combination of these datasets. Due to the availability of GPUs, this    approach may be used for just-in-time classification in anti-spam    systems handling huge amounts of emails. We have observed also that    mentioned publicly available datasets are no longer representative. We    overcame this limitation by using a much richer dataset from a one-week    long real traffic of the freemail provider Email.cz. The training data    annotation was created by user labeling of the emails. The image spam    (and image ham even more) tackles privacy issues. We overcame it by    publishing extracted feature vectors with associated classes (instead of    images itself). This data does not violate privacy issues. We have    published Email.cz image spam dataset v1 via the AcademicTorrents    platform and propose a system, which achieves up to 96\% F1-score with    presented model architecture on this novel dataset.

One of the most common effective attacks is phishing,    in which attempts are made to steal confidential information by    impersonating a legitimate source. The success of phishing emails is    based on manipulating human emotions, which leads to concerns and    creates an urgent situation by claiming that the recipient should take    quick action that may cause great financial and data losses. Therefore,    we cannot rely solely on humans to detect phishing, and more effective    and automatic phishing detection mechanisms are required. Many detectors    have been proposed; however, the high number of phishing emails urges    additional effort. Hence, in this study, we propose a phishing email    classifier model that applies deep learning algorithms using a graph    convolutional network (GCN) and natural language processing over an    email body text to improve phishing detection accuracy. The literature    has proved GCN success in text classification, and this study proved its    success in improving the accuracy of email phishing detection. The    classifier was tested in a supervised learning approach. Experimental    tests verified that the classifier was effective in detecting phishing    emails using body text among the existing detection methods, and it took    short time and produced a high accuracy rate of 98.2\% and a low    false-positive rate of 0.015.

USENIX Assoc,Weak Links in Authentication Chains: A Large-scale Analysis of Email    Sender Spoofing Attacks,,2021,,,3201-3217,,"As a fundamental communicative service, email is playing an important    role in both individual and corporate communications, which also makes    it one of the most frequently attack vectors. An email's authenticity is    based on an authentication chain involving multiple protocols, roles and    services, the inconsistency among which creates security threats. Thus,    it depends on the weakest link of the chain, as any failed part can    break the whole chain-based defense.    This paper systematically analyzes the transmission of an email and    identifies a series of new attacks capable of bypassing SPF, DKIM, DMARC    and user-interface protections. In particular, by conducting a    ``cocktail{''} joint attack, more realistic emails can be forged to    penetrate the celebrated email services, such as Gmail and Outlook. We    conduct a largescale experiment on 30 popular email services and 23    email clients, and find that all of them are vulnerable to certain types    of new attacks. We have duly reported the identified vulnerabilities to    the related email service providers, and received positive responses    from 11 of them, including Gmail, Yahoo, iCloud and Alibaba.    Furthermore, we propose key mitigating measures to defend against the    new attacks. Therefore, this work is of great value for identifying    email spoofing attacks and improving the email ecosystem's overall    security.",USENIX ASSOC,"SUITE 215, 2560 NINTH ST, BERKELEY, CA 94710 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Zheng, XF; Liu, BJ (Corresponding Author), Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.

Authentication efficiency can be further improved by organizing    authentication order properly. Intra-domain is used to affirm the    sender's IP address which is used to trace the sender.

With the expansion of Web services, denial of    service (DoS) attacks by malicious automated programs (e.g., web bots)    is becoming a serious problem of web service accounts. A HIP, or Human    Interactive Proofs, is a human authentication mechanism that generates    and grades tests to determine whether the user is a human or a malicious    computer program. Unfortunately, the existing HIPs tried to maximize the    difficulty for automated programs to pass tests by increasing distortion    or noise. Consequently, it has also become difficult for potential users    too. So there is a tradeoff between the usability and robustness in    designing HIP tests. In our proposed technique we tried to balance the    readability and security by adding contextual information in the form of    natural conversation without reducing the distortion and noise. In the    result section, a microscopic large-scale user study was conducted    involving 110 users to investigate the actual user views compare to    existing state of the art CAPTCHA systems like Google's reCAPTCHA and    Microsoft's CAPTCHA in terms of usability and security and found our    system capable of deploying largely over internet.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Nayeem, MT (Corresponding Author), IUT, Dept Comp Sci \& Informat Technol CIT, Gazipur 1704, Bangladesh.

IEEE,Breaking the Password Security Standards Using Offline Attacks and    Public User Attributes,,2019,,,,,"Password security standards based on the Shannon Entropy were made to    ensure that users are protected from attacks. This research investigates    the possibility of breaking the password security standards using    offline attacks and public user attributes. The idea here is to reduce    the keyspace by collecting a character set that is likely to be chosen    as a password. Ten million compromised passwords were used to establish    the Dictionary Character Set, while 1.4 billion compromised email    accounts were used to establish the User-Attribute Character Set. Based    on the experiments conducted, we proved that there is a high chance of    breaking 8 - 10 character length passwords in a reasonable time.    Dictionary and Attribute-Based attacks were proved to work in the wild    based on cracking time and the number of compromised passwords in the    datasets. Results show that it is possible to break the password    standards using offline attacks and public user attributes in a    reasonable time. A Machine Sensitive Key Based Password Strength Metric    is then proposed based on the ratio of risk and safe probabilities of    the password. The metric is based on the measurements gathered from the    Brute Force, Dictionary and Attribute-Based Password Attacks.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Cacacho, HRG (Corresponding Author), Mariano Marcos State Univ, Dept Comp Sci, City Of Batac 2906, Ilocos Norte, Philippines.

Internet Security and Human Vulnerability,JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS,2017,18,1,22-44,JAN,"A leading cause of security breaches is a basic human vulnerability: our    susceptibility to deception. Hackers exploit this vulnerability by    sending phishing emails that induce users to click on malicious links    that then download malware or trick the victim into revealing personal    confidential information to the hacker. Past research has focused on    human susceptibility to generic phishing emails or individually targeted    spear-phishing emails. This study addresses how contextualization of    phishing emails for targeted groups impacts their susceptibility to    phishing. We manipulated the framing and content of email messages and    tested the effects on users' susceptibility to phishing. We constructed    phishing emails to elicit either the fear of losing something valuable    (e.g., course registrations, tuition assistance) or the anticipation of    gaining something desirable (e.g., iPad, gift card, social networks). We    designed the emails' context to manipulate human psychological    weaknesses such as greed, social needs, and so on. We sent fictitious    (benign) emails to 7,225 undergraduate students and recorded their    responses. Results revealed that contextualizing messages to appeal to    recipients' psychological weaknesses increased their susceptibility to    phishing. The fear of losing or anticipation of gaining something    valuable increased susceptibility to deception and vulnerability to    phishing. The results of our study provide important contributions to    information security research, including a theoretical framework based    on the heuristic-systematic processing model to study the susceptibility    of users to deception. We demonstrate through our experiment that    several situational factors do, in fact, alter the effectiveness of    phishing attempts.",ASSOC INFORMATION SYSTEMS,"GEORGIA STATE UNIV, 35 BROAD STREET, STE 916-917, ATLANTA, GA 30303 USA",Article,English,"Goel, S (Corresponding Author), SUNY Albany, Informat Technol Management, Albany, NY 12222 USA.

IEEE,Design and Evaluation of Inclusive Email Security Indicators for People    with Visual Impairments,,2023,,,2885-2902,,"Due to the challenges to detect and filter phishing emails, it is    inevitable that some phishing emails can still reach a user's inbox. As    a result, email providers such as Gmail have implemented phishing    warnings to help users to better recognize phishing attempts. Existing    research has primarily focused on phishing warnings for sighted users    and yet it is not well understood how people with visual impairments    interact with phishing emails and warnings. In this paper, we worked    with a group of users (N=41) with visual impairments to study the    effectiveness of existing warnings and explore more inclusive designs    (using Gmail warning designs as a baseline for comparison). We took a    multipronged approach including an exploratory study (to understand the    challenges faced by users), user-in-the-loop design and prototyping, and    the main study (to assess the impact of design choices). Our results    show that users with visual impairments often miss existing Gmail    warnings because the current design (e.g., warning position, HTML tags    used) does not match well with screen reader users' reading habits. The    inconsistencies of the warnings (e.g., across the Standard and HTML    view) also create obstacles to users. We show that an inclusive design    (combining audio warning, shortcut key, and warning page overlay) can    effectively increase the warning noticeability.

While remotely delivering and    assessing technology is not new, there are few methods available in the    literature that are proven to be effective with diverse populations, and    none for older adults specifically. Older adults comprise a diverse    population, including in terms of their experience with and access to    technology, making this a challenging endeavor.    Objective: Our objective was to remotely deliver and conduct usability    testing for a mobile health (mHealth) technology intervention for older    adult participants enrolled in a clinical trial of the technology. This    paper describes the methodology used, its successes, and its    limitations.    Methods: We developed a conceptual model for remote operations, called    the Framework for Agile and Remote Operations (FAR Ops), that combined    the general requirements for spaceflight operations with Agile project    management processes to quickly respond to this challenge. Using this    framework, we iteratively created care packages that differed in their    contents based on participant needs and were sent to study participants    to deliver the study intervention-a medication management app-and assess    its usability. Usability data were collected using the System Usability    Scale (SUS) and a novel usability questionnaire developed to collect    more in-depth data.    Results: In the first 6 months of the project, we successfully delivered    21 care packages. We successfully designed and deployed a minimum viable    product in less than 6 weeks, generally maintained a 2-week sprint    cycle, and achieved a 40\% to 50\% return rate for both usability    assessment instruments. We hypothesize that lack of engagement due to    the pandemic and our use of asynchronous communication channels    contributed to the return rate of usability assessments being lower than    desired. We also provide general recommendations for performing remote    usability testing with diverse populations based on the results of our    work, including implementing screen sharing capabilities when possible,    and determining participant preference for phone or email    communications.    Conclusions: The FAR Ops model allowed our team to adopt remote    operations for our mHealth trial in response to interruptions from the    COVID-19 pandemic. This approach can be useful for other research or    practice-based projects under similar circumstances or to improve    efficiency, cost, effectiveness, and participant diversity in general.    In addition to offering a replicable approach, this paper tells the    often-untold story of practical challenges faced by mHealth projects and    practical strategies used to address them.","JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC","130 QUEENS QUAY East, Unit 1100, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",Article,English,"Hill, JR (Corresponding Author), Indiana Univ Sch Med, Dept Med, 1101 W 10th St, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA.

LES is an extension of DKIM, the    recent IETF effort to standardize domain-based email signatures. LES    shares DKIM's ease of deployment: they both use the DNS to distribute a    single public key for each domain. Importantly, LES supports common uses    of email that DKIM jeopardizes: multiple email personalities, firewalled    ISPs, incoming-only email forwarding services, and other common uses    that often require sending email via a third-party SMTP server. In    addition, LES does not require DKIM's implied intra-domain mechanism for    authenticating users when they send email.    LES provides these features using identity-based signatures. Each domain    authority generates a master keypair, publishes the public component in    the DNS, and stores the private component securely. Using this private    component, the authority delivers to each of its users, via email, an    individual secret key whose identity string corresponds to the user's    email address. A sender then signs messages using this individual secret    key. A recipient verifies such a signature by querying the appropriate    master public key from the DNS, computing the sender's public key, and    verifying the signature accordingly. As an added bonus, the widespread    availability of user-level public keys enables deniable authentication,    such as ring signatures. Thus, LES provides email authentication with    optional repudiability.    We built a LES prototype to determine its practicality. Basic user tests    show that the system is relatively easy to use, and that cryptographic    performance, even when using deniable authentication, is well within    acceptable range.",SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",Article; Proceedings Paper,English,"Adida, B (Corresponding Author), MIT, CSAIL, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.

This    approach significantly improves efficiency and accuracy by segmenting    scanned email content into smaller, independently evaluated components.    The model underwent training and validation using four publicly    available benchmark datasets, achieving an impressive average accuracy    of 98.87\%, outperforming leading methods in the field. These findings    underscore the resilience and scalability of DaCGANSAEBF, positioning it    as a viable solution for contemporary spam detection systems. The    framework can be easily integrated into existing technologies to enhance    user security and reduce the risks associated with spam.",TECH SCIENCE PRESS,"871 CORONADO CENTER DR, SUTE 200, HENDERSON, NV 89052 USA",Article,English,"Alsheikhy, AA (Corresponding Author), Northern Border Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Elect Engn, Ar Ar 91431, Saudi Arabia.

Results    suggest that no single method identifies all or most problems. Rather,    each approach is optimal for evaluations at a different stage of design    and characterizes different usability aspect. Email responses elicited    from clinicians and surveys report mostly technical, biomedical,    terminology and control problems and are most effective when a working    prototype has been completed. Observations of clinical work and    interviews inform conceptual and workflow-related problems and are best    performed early in the cycle.

Many websites that provide online services to their users    also need to solve the problem of allowing their users to reset their    passwords (e.g., if they have forgotten it). A popular, established    technique for allowing a user to recover a lost account is to allow her    to send a reset link to her own account via email. Although it might    seem easy at a first glance, the security requirements of the password    recovery process require web sites to carefully design each step of the    process to be resilient even in the presence of an attack. In this    paper, we present an in-depth security analysis of the email-based    recovery mechanisms of a wide range of web applications. By manually    registering accounts and triggering the password recovery process for    each website, we were able to study the password reset mechanisms of web    sites from three different groups in the Alexa Top 5K (i.e., popular    sites, medium popular sites, low popular sites). In this work, we show    that the lack of standards in the password recovery process plagues many    websites with security weaknesses, and negatively influences the    security of the reset process itself.

IEEE,An Instrument to Measure Human Behavior Toward Cyber Security Policies,,2018,,,,,"Human is the weakest link in information security. Even with strong    cyber security policies an organization can still be hacked because of a    human error. Even if people are aware of the policies and their    importance they might not behave accordingly. This shows to the    importance of studying and measuring human behavior toward cyber    security policies. This paper introduces a new instrument that can be    used to measure human behavior toward cybersecurity policies through    creative measures. The goal is to gather data about human behaviors    toward cybersecurity policies in natural environment. This method of    gathering information allows people to behave normally and don't feel    the need to answer perfectly. The paper illustrates all the previous    work related to the subject, summarizing previous work in order to    improve what have been previously done. The methodology seeks on    measuring behavior based on specific measures. These measures are the    password, email, identity, sensitive data, and physical/resource    security. Each measure has a number of policies used to measure    behavior. These policies were selected among several policies based on    literature from the same field and the opinion of experts in the field.    These question that went through several rounds of check were used to    build the proposed instrument. This instrument then shall be used by    researchers to collect data and perform the required analysis. This    paper discusses the behavior pattern in a detail and concise manner.

They also    increase the chances of receiving spam e-mails. E-mails sent to multiple    recipients at a time result in unwanted exposure of e-mail address to    multiple recipients. The recipients of chain e-mails may include    spammers or e- mail addresses of users whose e-mail account or device    may have been compromised, thereby, exposing all email addresses to    spammers. Forwarding or sending a multirecipient e-mail in a chain    further increases the exposure of email addresses to spammers. This    paper discusses chain emails, multi-recipient e-mails and crucial    security and privacy threats they pose to legitimate e-mail user. It    also discusses various possible mechanisms to mitigate these threats and    investigates their effectiveness. This study proposes a novel technique    to counter these security risks by enhancing the default behaviour of    e-mail client, SMPT server and SMTP protocol.

USENIX Assoc,Pre-hijacked accounts: An Empirical Study of Security Failures in User    Account Creation on the Web,,2022,,BT8TA,1795-1812,,"The ubiquity of user accounts in websites and online services makes    account hijacking a serious security concern. Although previous research    has studied various techniques through which an attacker can gain access    to a victim's account, relatively little attention has been directed    towards the process of account creation. The current trend towards    federated authentication (e.g., Single Sign-On) adds an additional layer    of complexity because many services now support both the classic    approach in which the user directly sets a password, and the federated    approach in which the user authenticates via an identity provider.    Inspired by previous work on preemptive account hijacking {[}17], we    show that there exists a whole class of account pre-hijacking attacks.    The distinctive feature of these attacks is that the attacker performs    some action before the victim creates an account, which makes it trivial    for the attacker to gain access after the victim has created/recovered    the account. Assuming a realistic attacker who knows only the victim's    email address, we identify and discuss five different types of account    pre-hijacking attacks.    To ascertain the prevalence of such vulnerabilities in the wild, we    analyzed 75 popular services and found that at least 35 of these were    vulnerable to one or more account pre-hijacking attacks. Whilst some of    these may be noticed by attentive users, others were completely    undetectable from the victim's perspective. Finally, we investigated the    root cause of these vulnerabilities and present a set of security    requirements to prevent such vulnerabilities arising in future.",USENIX ASSOC,"SUITE 215, 2560 NINTH ST, BERKELEY, CA 94710 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Paverd, Andrew, Microsoft Secur Response Ctr, Redmond, WA USA.",,,,,Computer Science,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory \&    Methods",inproceedings,WOS:000855237502023,,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 31ST USENIX SECURITY SYMPOSIUM,,"31st USENIX Security Symposium, Boston, MA, AUG 10-12, 2022",978-1-939133-31-1,,USENIX Assoc; Meta; Google; NSF; Baidu; Chainlink; IBM; Intel Secur; Red    Canary; Mercari; Paloalto; Technol Innovat Inst,,42,5,0,0,,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),WOS:000855237502023,2025-07-09,,Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC),"We thank our shepherd, Emily Stark, and the anonymous reviewers for    their valuable feedback.

USENIX Association,Content-Type: multipart/oracle Tapping into Format Oracles in Email    End-to-End Encryption,,2023,,BV7HQ,4175-4192,,"S/MIME and OpenPGP use cryptographic constructions repeatedly shown to    be vulnerable to format oracle attacks in protocols like TLS, SSH, or    IKE. However, format oracle attacks in the End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)    email setting are considered impractical as victims would need to open    many attacker-modified emails and communicate the decryption result to    the attacker. But is this really the case?    In this paper, we survey how an attacker may remotely learn the    decryption state in email E2EE. We analyze the interplay of MIME and    IMAP and describe side-channels emerging from network patterns that leak    the decryption status in Mail User Agents (MUAs). Concretely, we    introduce specific MIME trees that produce decryption-dependent network    patterns when opened in a victim's email client.    We survey 19 OpenPGP- and S/MIME-enabled email clients and four    cryptographic libraries and uncover a side-channel leaking the    decryption status of S/MIME messages in one client. Further, we discuss    why the exploitation in the other clients is impractical and show that    it is due to missing feature support and implementation quirks. These    unintended defenses create an unfortunate conflict between usability and    security.

In most cyber security    contexts, users are faced with trade-offs between information security    and other important attributes that they desire to maximize. We examined    this issue by eliciting the ``security premiums{''} that users were    willing to sacrifice to protect their information security in a phishing    context. We also examined the effect of usage contexts on value of    information security using an experimental design. Respondents from    Amazon Mechanical Turk were randomized into one of three conditions in    which the context of a phishing attack was varied. Respondents were    asked to make trade-offs between pairs of attributes including security,    cost, latency, and productivity, from which we could quantify security    premiums. Results indicated that half of the respondents were willing to    pay a premium between \$9 and \$11 per month, willing to wait between 8    and 9 additional minutes, and willing to forgo their access to 21-29    valid pieces of information, to obtain a more effective phishing filter    that reduces the number of false negatives from 24 to 6 per month.    Interestingly, the value of information security was sensitive to the    usage context, such that social media invoked greater security premiums    in terms of productivity than email and web surfing. We also found that    vulnerability and perceived net benefit significantly correlated with    security premiums in terms of monthly cost.

These days spam is a serious concern that    causes major problems in today's internet. Spam emails are uninhibited    messages that are sent to a large number of beneficiaries arbitrarily.    Owing to an overgrowing rise in reputation, the number of unsolicited    data has also increased promptly and has led to many security concerns.    Although the sufficient number of spam filtering techniques exists,    nowadays spammers start discovering innovative practices to escape data    that are filtered using the spam filters. Spammers use this    communication source for spreading the malware in the name of an    executable file. These spam emails waste user's system memory, computing    power, and bandwidth of the network. Spam emails have been initiated to    progressively damage the integrity of email and destroy the online    experience. The research revealed that if the classification algorithms    are used with feature selection then that will return the exact results    than the standard classification.

This ever-growing use of social    networks leverages cyber-attackers to exploit various phishing schemes,    spoofed accounts, and other threats to steal users' credentials.    Phishing is an online crime that employs both technical subterfuge and    social engineering to steal consumers' personal identity, financial    account credentials, and other sensitive information. In general, a    phishing attack is carried out by the exercise of sending fraudulent    communications (like a fake email with harmful uniform resource    locators), that pretends to come from a reputable source. The problem of    designing user authentication protocol for mitigating phishing attacks    in OSNs is a challenging research problem. In this article, we propose a    secure and lightweight cryptography-based authentication scheme, called    authentication scheme for phishing attack (ASPA)-mobile online social    network (mOSN), that provides resistance to phishing and other related    attacks in OSNs. The security of the proposed scheme is explained using    both informal security analysis and formal security analysis through the    widely recognized real-or-random model and ProVerif simulation tool.    Finally, we compare the security, functionality, computation, and    communication costs of the proposed ASPA-mOSN with related schemes.

The IoT-enabled smart city can greatly benefit    people's daily lives, where smartphone is one of the most widely used    IoT devices. For example, people can use the phone to check their    financial account, store personal data and communicate with peers. Thus    it is very important to safeguard the phones from unauthorized access.    To complement traditional textual passwords, touch behavioral    authentication has attracted much attention while it is still a    challenge on how to build a robust scheme in practice. This is because    users' touch actions are often dynamic and hard to model. For this    challenge, previous work has proved that touch actions could become    consistent when users interact with social networking applications.    Motivated by this observation, in this work, we perform a study to    investigate users' touch behavior within Email applications on    smartphones (with Email being one of the most important and widely used    means in connecting with others). The study results with 60 participants    validate the former observation that users' touch behavioral deviation    can be greatly decreased when they play Email applications.

The encrypted content    was then attached along with the email {[}10]. This approach used to be    inconvenient for the user and used to make the email bulky by increasing    the size. In the field of email security, many other systems exist but    these commercial products are tightly coupled to the email servers and    web browsers {[}11] and in a way are too specific to a particular    security feature.

This paper proposes an adversarial framework, SpearBot, which utilizes    LLMs to generate spear-phishing emails with various phishing strategies.    Through specifically crafted jailbreak prompts, SpearBot circumvents    security policies and introduces other LLM instances as critics. When a    phishing email is identified by the critic, SpearBot refines the    generated email based on the critique feedback until it can no longer be    recognized as phishing, thereby enhancing its deceptive quality. To    evaluate the effectiveness of SpearBot, we implement various    machine-based defenders and assess how well the phishing emails    generated could deceive them. Results show these emails often evade    detection to a large extent, underscoring their deceptive quality.    Additionally, human evaluations of the emails' readability and deception    are conducted through questionnaires, confirming their convincing nature    and the significant potential harm of the generated phishing emails.

Automated classification of these categories can increase the users'    awareness as well as to be used for incident investigation    prioritization or automated fact gathering. However, currently there are    no scientific papers focusing on email classification concerning these    two categories of spam and phishing emails.

Data loss prevention is    an embedded process used to protect against disclosure of sensitive data    to external uncontrolled environments. A typical Data Loss Prevention    (DLP) system uses custom policies to identify and prevent accidental and    malicious data leakage producing large number of security alerts    including significant volume of false positives. Consequently,    identifying legitimate data loss can be very challenging as each    incident comprises of different characteristics often requiring    extensive intervention by a domain expert to review alerts individually.    This limits the ability to detect data loss alerts in real-time making    organisations vulnerable to financial and reputational damages. The aim    of this research is to strengthen data loss detection capabilities of a    DLP system by implementing a machine learning model to predict the    likelihood of legitimate data loss. We conducted extensive    experimentation using Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms with    historical email incident data collected by a globally established    telecommunication enterprise. The final model produced with Random    Forest algorithm was identified as the most effective as it was    successfully able to predict approximately 95\% data loss incidents    accurately with an average true positive value of 90\%. Furthermore, the    proposed solution successfully enables identification of legitimate data    loss in email DLP whilst facilitating prioritisation of real data loss    through human-understandable explanation of the decision thereby    improving the efficiency of the process.

This endeavor runs    into serious usability problems. Given that it is usually unknown what    kind of device is infected, they can only provide users with very    generic cleanup advice, trying to cover all device types and remediation    paths. Does this advice work? To what extent do users comply with the    instructions? And does more compliance lead to higher cleanup rates?    This study is the first to shed light on these questions. In partnership    with an ISP, we designed a randomized control experiment followed up by    a user survey. We randomly assigned 177 consumers affected by malware    from the Mirai family to three different groups: (i) notified via a    walled garden (quarantine network), (ii) notified via email, and (iii)    no immediate notification, i.e. a control group. The notification asks    the user to take five steps to remediate the infection. We conducted a    phone survey with 95 of these customers based on communication-human    information processing theory. We model the impact of the treatment,    comprehension, and motivation on the compliance rate of each customer,    while controlling for differences in demographics and infected device    types. We also estimate the extent to which compliance leads to    successful cleanup of the infected IoT devices. While only 24\% of    notified users perform all five remediation steps, 92\% of notified    users perform at least one action. Compliance increases the probability    of successful cleanup by 32\%, while the presence of competing malware    reduces it by 54\%.

IEEE,VeriActor: Dynamic Generation of Challenge-Response Questions for    Enhanced Email Sender Verification,,2023,,,,,"Challenge-response mechanisms have become widely adopted as a means of    user verification. In this process, users are required to provide a set    of challenge questions, with their actual answers serving as a means to    authenticate the user's identity. Despite the widespread usability of    challenge-response as an authentication mechanism, it remains vulnerable    to evasion by attackers who can employ social engineering tactics or    gather information to guess or steal the necessary credentials.    To address this inherent challenge, this paper presents a novel    technique for dynamically generating challenge-response questions based    on authentic historical interactions, such as daily communication via    email or messaging platforms. We developed deep learning models,    utilizing language models such as BERT, and employed semantic analysis    to extract and validate highly usable challenge-response questions.    These questions are designed to be easily answerable by legitimate users    while presenting an unpredictable challenge to potential attackers.    As an effective use case demonstration for our proposed system, we    developed an email sender verification system capable of real-time    identification of suspicious email senders. This system prompts the    senders with carefully crafted challenge questions based on previous    email exchanges with authentic users, enabling the identification of    advanced spear-phishing emails that would otherwise remain undetected.    We evaluated the effectiveness of our system, named VeriActor, through    the use of annotated datasets and a user study. The experimental results    exhibited promising outcomes, with a verification accuracy of 87.8\% and    a protection accuracy of 83.33\%.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Abdeen, B (Corresponding Author), Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Engn \& Comp Sci, Dept Comp Sci, Richardson, TX 75083 USA.

As a    result, email encryption has become more commonplace as concerns about    cloud privacy and security grow. Nevertheless, this increase in usage is    creating the challenge of how to effectively be searching and filtering    the encrypted emails. They are popular technologies of solving the issue    of the encrypted emails searching through searchable public key    encryption. However, the problem of encrypted email filtering remains to    be solved. As a new approach to finding and filtering encrypted emails    in the cloud, we propose a ciphertext-based encrypted policy    attribute-based encryption scheme and keyword search procedure based on    hidden policy ciphertext. This feature allows the user of searching    using some encrypted emails keywords in the cloud as well as allowing    the emails filter-based server toward filter the content of the    encrypted emails, similar to the traditional email keyword filtering    service. By utilizing composite order bilinear groups, a hidden policy    system has been successfully demonstrated to be secure by our dual    system encryption process.

"Wang, Mengli and Song, Lipeng",Efficient defense strategy against spam and phishing email: An    evolutionary game model,JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS,2021,61,102947,,SEP,"Spam and phishing emails are never-ending problems, and they are    increasingly distributed with the help of the botnet. Existing spam and    phishing email defense depends heavily on the spam filtering technique.    However, using the spam filtering technique needs many defensive    resources, which are usually limited. Therefore, to achieve the maximum    effect with limited defense resources, we answer the following questions    in this paper: How many user nodes we should protect in a target    network? What factors affect this and how? To solve these problems, we    propose an evolutional game model between multiple attackers and    multiple defenders and analyze the evolution process of their    strategies. The optimal number of users protected is first obtained as    an efficient defense strategy, which can reduce resource consumption and    lower attack density. Then we discover that this defense strategy is    affected by the email opening probability of users, the attack cost, and    the attack loss. Our results can help email network managers deploy the    spam filtering technique according to the email opening probability, of    which the defender has an asymmetric information advantage. Furthermore,    we study the influences of the attack cost and loss on the defense    strategy. It is revealed that the attack cost has a more marked effect    on the defense strategy compared to the attack loss. Finally, we    experiment on a large real-world dataset of emails sent in 2-year time    duration. The defense strategy is proven to be effective for maximizing    defense resources.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Song, LP (Corresponding Author), Shandong Univ, Sch Mech Elect \& Informat Engn, Weihai 264209, Peoples R China.

Vaxtracker, an online tool    used to monitor vaccine safety, has successfully demonstrated its    usefulness in postmarketing surveillance of newly introduced childhood    vaccines. However, its use in older participants, or for monitoring    patients participating in large clinical trials, has not been evaluated.    Objective: The objective of this study was to monitor AEFIs in older    participants enrolled in the Australian Study for the Prevention through    the Immunisation of Cardiovascular Events (AUSPICE) trial, and to    evaluate the usefulness and effectiveness of Vaxtracker in this research    setting.    Methods: AUSPICE is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled,    double-blinded trial in which participants aged 55 to 61 years were    given either the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23vPPV) or 0.9\%    saline placebo. Vaxtracker was used to monitor AEFIs in participants in    either treatment arm through the administration of two online    questionnaires. A link to each questionnaire was sent to participants    via email or short message service (SMS) text message 7 and 28 days    following vaccination. Data were collated and analyzed in near-real time    to identify any possible safety signals indicating problems with the    vaccine or placebo.    Results: All 4725 AUSPICE participants were enrolled in Vaxtracker.    Participant response rates for the first and final survey were 96.47\%    (n=4558) and 96.65\% (n=4525), respectively. The online survey was    completed by 90.23\% (4083/4525) of Vaxtracker participants within 3    days of receiving the link. AEFIs were reported by 34.40\% (805/2340) of    23vPPV recipients and 10.29\% (240/2332) of placebo recipients in the 7    days following vaccination. Dominant symptoms for vaccine and placebo    recipients were pain at the injection site (587/2340, 25.09\%) and    fatigue (103/2332, 4.42\%), respectively. Females were more likely to    report symptoms following vaccination with 23vPPV compared with males    (433/1138, 38.05\% versus 372/1202, 30.95\%; P<.001).    Conclusions: Vaxtracker is an effective tool for monitoring AEFIs in the    55 to 61 years age group. Participant response rates were high for both    surveys, in both treatment arms and for each method of sending the    survey. This study indicates that administration of 23vPPV was    well-tolerated in this cohort. Vaxtracker has successfully demonstrated    its application in the monitoring of adverse events in near-real time    following vaccination in people participating in a national clinical    trial.","JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC","130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",Article,English,"Munnoch, SA (Corresponding Author), Hunter New England Local Hlth Dist, Locked Mail Bag 10, Wallsend, NSW 2287, Australia.

We describe a protocol for responding to those who indicate    increased risk of self-harm (i.e. suicidality or potentially lethal    alcohol use) as an example and report on the outcome of our procedures.    Methods Participants were first-year college students (n = 891)    participating in an intervention trial for binge drinking. We describe    the protocol, provide descriptive outcomes, and examine whether    participant sex, attrition, or study intervention condition were related    to endorsing items that indicated risk for suicidality or potentially    lethal alcohol use. Results Of the 891 participants, 167 (18.7\%) were    identified as being at risk in one or more study wave. Of those, we were    able to successfully contact 100 (59.9\%), 76 (45.5\%) by phone, and 24    (14.4\%) by email. Of those 100, 78 accepted mental health resources as    a result of outreach. Participant sex, attrition, and intervention    condition were not related to risk. Discussion This article may aid    other research teams in developing similar protocols. Strategies to    reach an even greater proportion of high-risk participants are needed.

P. and Byun, Y.",An Improved OTP Grid Authentication Scheme Email-based using    Middle-square for Disaster Management System,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GRID AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING,2017,10,11,43-56,NOV,"Disaster is an attempt to control or access the system without    legal/valid permission and proper authorization protocol from legitimate    entity. Nowadays, most organizations managed to save records in an    online database transmitted over unpredictable network. To gain access    to the system it is better if proper authentication be placed because it    may affect the organization operation and sensitive information may be    at risk (like early warning notification, casualty monitoring, initial    and post assessment, rescue operation, response recovery, etc) if system    has been compromised. This paper introduced a new scheme of one time    password (OTP) email-based authentication and improved the    authentication scheme using middle square technique to protect and    secure confidential information for disaster management system. The    One-Time Password has been recognized by many organizations as a    breakthrough to two-factor authentication technique. It solves the    shortcomings of the traditional username/password authentication. The    OTP generates the initial seed based from the combination of several    parameters like string of characters, numbers, date, time and weather    data (humidity and temperature). The values generated changes overtime    upon login registration as it extract location weather data producing an    approximately 91 possible values or 4,095 possible combinations. The    application has primary components namely: about, signup and login. It    authenticates the user up to three (3) login attempts only then follows    the redirection process. This scheme improved the security, protection    and confidence level of the user as it uses a randomized generation of    OTP codes sent through secured email account that is free from brute    force, dictionary attack, insider attack, and key-logger attacks.",SCIENCE \& ENGINEERING RESEARCH SUPPORT SOC,"RM 402, MAN-JE BLDG, 449-8 OJUNG-DONG, DAEDOEK-GU, DAEJON, 00000, SOUTH    KOREA",Article,English,"Balilo, BB (Corresponding Author), Technol Inst Philippines, Quezon City, Philippines.

IEEE,Issues and Trends in Information Security Policy Compliance,,2019,,PID6294273,,,"In the era of Industry 4.0 (IR 4.0), information leakage has become a    critical issue for information security. The basic approach to    addressing information leakage threats is to implement an information    security policy (ISP) that defines the standards, boundaries, and    responsibilities of users of information and technology of an    organization. ISPs are one of the most commonly used methods for    controlling internal user security behaviours, which include, but not    limited to, computer usage ethics; organizational system usage policies;    Internet and email usage policies; and the use of social media. Human    error is the main security threat to information security, resulting    from negligence, ignorance, and failure to adhere to organizational    information security policies. Information security incidents are a    problem related to human behaviour because technology is designed and    operated by humans, presenting the opportunities and spaces for human    error. In addition to the factor of human error as the main source of    information leakage, this study aims to systematically analyse the    fundamental issues of information security policy compliance. An    analysis of these papers identifies and categories critical factor that    effect an employee's attitude toward compliance with ISP. The human,    process, technology element and information governance should be thought    as a significant scope for more efficiency of information security    policy compliance and in any further extensive studies to improve on    information security policy compliance. Therefore, to ensure these are    properly understood, further study is needed to identity the information    governance that needs to be included in organizations and current best    practices for developing an information security policy compliance    within organizations.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Bhaharin, SH (Corresponding Author), Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Informat Sci \& Technol, Ctr Cyber Secur, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia.

Makers of this software must choose    between interrupting the user to update immediately or allowing them to    update later. In either case, assessing the content of the interruption    may still require cognitive investment. However, by allowing the user to    negotiate a delayed response to these interruptions, users can instead    focus on their work. This paper experimentally examines the effect of    immediate and negotiated interruptions on user decision time and    decision accuracy in multiple stage tasks. For complex tasks, decision    performance is higher when the user can negotiate the onset of and    response to interruptions. The option to defer response also results in    greater subjective perceptions of control, improved task resumption and    reduced feelings of interruption and distraction on the part of the    user, even within a short period of time.

IEEE Computer Soc,SSARES: Secure searchable automated remote email storage,,2007,,,129+,,"The increasing centralization of networked services places user data at    considerable risk. For example, many users store email on remote servers    rather than on their local disk. Doing so allows users to gain the    benefit of regular backups and remote access, but it also places a great    deal of unwarranted trust in the server Since most email is stored in    plaintext, a compromise of the server implies the loss of    confidentiality and integrity of the email stored therein. Although    users could employ an end-to-end encryption scheme (e.g., PGP), such    measures are not widely adopted, require action on the sender side, only    provide partial protection (the email headers remain in the clear), and    prevent the users from performing some common operations, such as    server-side search.    To address this problem, we present Secure Searchable Automated Remote    Email Storage (SSARES), a novel system that offers a practical approach    to both securing remotely stored email and allowing privacy-preserving    search of that email collection. Our solution encrypts email (the    headers, body, and attachments) as it arrives on the server using    public-key encryption. SSARES uses a combination of Identity Based    Encryption and Bloom Filters to create a searchable index. This index    reveals little information about search keywords and queries, even    against adversaries that compromise the server SSARES remains largely    transparent to both the sender and recipient.",IEEE COMPUTER SOC,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Aviv, AJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Penn, Dept Comp \& Informat Sci, 200 S 33Rd St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.

Yet user    response to phishing emails is far from uniform; some respond while    others do not. What is the source of this diversity in decision-making?    From a psychological perspective, we consider cognitive and situational    influences that might explain why certain users are more susceptible    than others. Alongside an email judgment task employed as a proxy for    fraud susceptibility, 224 participants completed a range of cognitive    tasks. In addition, we manipulated time pressure for email legitimacy    judgments. We identify cognitive reflection and sensation seeking as    significant, albeit modest, predictors of susceptibility. Further to    this, participants asked to make quicker responses made more judgment    errors. We conclude there are cognitive signatures that partially    contribute to email fraud susceptibility, with implications for efforts    to limit online security breaches and train secure behaviors.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",Article,English,"Jones, HS (Corresponding Author), Univ Lancaster, Dept Psychol, Lancaster, England.

"Yue, Hongzhou and He, Shuilong and Liu, Zhenghui",Social Media Users Send Promotional Links to Strangers: Legitimate    Promotion or Security Vulnerability?,IEEE ACCESS,2020,8,,41705-41718,,"Nowadays, many users make money by publishing content on social media    platforms. In order to attract users' attention, they often take    measures to promote themselves. The security vulnerabilities in social    media platforms may provide convenience for their user promotion work.    We call this type of vulnerability the user promotion security    vulnerability (UPSV). UPSV may cause unfair competition and endanger the    interests of legitimate users and the social media platforms. Therefore    it has great research significance to find and fix this vulnerability.    In this paper, we propose a UPSV which widely exists in the function of    sending messages to strangers of in-app chatting of many social media    platforms. We first analyzed this vulnerability in some apps, and then    YY app (China's largest live streaming platform) was chosen as the    research object to verify the actual effect of the vulnerability on    illegitimate user promotion. We took the method of promoting a target YY    streamer through sending promotional links to viewers, and to improve    promotion effect, we used the method of user preference learning to    select viewers for promotion. The experimental results show that among    the promoted viewers, more than 44\% entered the target streamers'    channels to watch live streaming, more than 21\% followed the target    steamers, and more than 13\% gave gifts to the target steamers. It fully    proves that this UPSV is real, exploitable and harmful, and we also    proposed some fix suggestions to help the platforms to fix it.",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Article,English,"Yue, HZ (Corresponding Author), Xinyang Normal Univ, Sch Comp \& Informat Technol, Xinyang 464000, Peoples R China.

IEEE,Optimising user security recommendations for AI-powered smart-homes,,2022,,,,,"Research in the context of user awareness has shown that smart-home    occupants often lack cybersecurity awareness even when it comes to    frequently used technologies such as online social networks and email.    To cope with the risks, smart-homes must be equipped with adequate    cybersecurity measures besides the knowledge and time required by    smarthome occupants to implement security measures. In this paper, we    explore potential threats in AI-powered smart-homes and identify a list    of cybersecurity controls required to mitigate their potential impact    considering attack vectors, as well as the time and knowledge required    to implement a control. We use optimisation to identify the best set of    controls to minimise the risk exposure considering these metrics. Our    comparative analysis against a random selection approach highlight that    our approach is at least 25\% better at minimising risk.

ACM,Influencing Mental Models of Security: A Research Agenda,,2011,,,57-66,,"Over 80 million households in the United States have a home computer and    an Internet connection. The vast majority of these are administered by    people who have little computer security knowledge or training, and many    users try to avoid making security decisions because they feel they    don't have the knowledge and skills to maintain proper security.    Nevertheless, home computer users still make security-related decisions    on a regular basis for example, whether or not to click on a shady link    in an email message without even knowing that's what they are doing.    Their decisions are guided by how they think about computer security, or    their ``mental models,{''} which do not have to be technically correct    to lead to desirable security behaviors {[}44]. In other words,    sometimes even ``wrong{''} mental models produce good security    decisions. By eliminating the constraint that nontechnical users must    become more like computer security experts to properly protect    themselves, we believe that we can create more effective ways of helping    home computer users make good security decisions.

IEEE,iCAPTCHA: The Next Generation of CAPTCHA Designed to Defend Against 3rd    Party Human Attacks,,2011,,,,,"CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and    Humans Apart) is a simple test that is easy for humans but extremely    difficult for computers to solve. CAPTCHA has been widely used in    commercial websites such as web-based email providers, TicketMaster,    GoDaddy, and Facebook to protect their resources from attacks initiated    by automatic scripts. By design, CAPTCHA is unable to distinguish    between a human attacker and a legitimate human user. This leaves    websites using CAPTCHA vulnerable to 3rd party human CAPTCHA attacks. In    order to demonstrate the vulnerabilities in existing CAPTCHA    technologies we develop a new streamlined human-based CAPTCHA attack    that uses Instant Messenger infrastructure. Facing this serious    human-based attack threat, we then present a new defense system called    Interactive CAPTCHA (iCAPTCHA), which is the next generation of CAPTCHA    technology providing the first steps toward defending against 3rd party    human CAPTCHA attacks. iCAPTCHA requires a user to solve a CAPTCHA test    via a series of user interactions. The multi-step back-and-forth traffic    between client and server amplifies the statistical timing difference    between a legitimate user and a human solver, which enables better    attack detection performance. A performance and usability study of    iCAPTCHA shows the proposed scheme is effective in attack detection, is    easy to use, and is a viable replacement of the current text-based    CAPTCHA.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Truong, HD (Corresponding Author), Univ Cent Florida, Orlando, FL 32816 USA.

ACM,An Analysis of Relationship between Storage Usage Distribution and    Per-User Quota Value,,2016,,,153-158,,"To prevent resource (especially storage) shortage, information systems    such as storage services and email services usually impose an upper    bound of resource consumption (quota) per user. In a conservative way,    an administrator tends to set a quota value such as the storage capacity    divided by the expected maximum number of users for safety and fairness,    but it tends to leave large unused storage space, because the users'    storage usage pattern shows a long-tailed distribution. In this paper,    we analyzed storage usage distribution of some email services to    approximate the distribution using a power-law distribution, and    proposed a method to calculate an optimal quota value from a target size    of storage consumption to increase storage utilization. We applied an    optimal quota value we calculated to a real email service and analyzed    the effect of quota change. Then, we analyzed actual distributions    further to find a better model to approximate the distribution, and    found that a log-normal distribution explained the distribution better    than power-law. We also analyzed two other universities' email service    to find similar distribution in these systems.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Kasahara, Y (Corresponding Author), Kyushu Univ, Higashi Ku, 6-10-1 Hakozaki, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan.

In addition, this poses additional    security threats for business employees as well as organizations. In    order to better respond to security threats, business employees must    have a higher level of awareness of the potential threats that are    relevant to digital infrastructure used within the workplace. In this    paper, we present a quantitative study conducted in line with the theory    of planned behavior to gain insight into employee behavior toward    information security within different business sectors in Saudi Arabia.    The key factors chosen for our model were password management,    infrastructure security management, email management, organizational    security policy, organizational support and training, and the perception    of the level of security. We have applied structured equation modelling    to identify most of the relevant factors based on the respondents'    feedback. The results based on the business employee behavior showed    that they respondents did not perceive all of the constructs of our    model as relevant security factors, which can potentially result in    security lapses. This indicates that more security-related measures    should be put in place and that business employees should be updated    periodically about potential security threats. To this effect, we    divided the studied security measures into those which should be    implemented at organizational and individual levels. The results will    potentially help business managers to design appropriate security    trainings, guidelines, and policies for their employees to ensure more    information security awareness and protect their technological    infrastructure, especially within home office environments.",MDPI,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Article,English,"Saeed, S (Corresponding Author), Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal Univ, Coll Comp Sci \& Informat Technol, Saudi Aramco Cybersecur Chair, Dept Comp Informat Syst, POB 1982, Dammam 31441, Saudi Arabia.

USENIX Association,Security and Privacy Failures in Popular 2FA Apps,,2023,,BV7HQ,2079-2096,,"The Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) algorithm is a 2FA method that    is widely deployed because of its relatively low implementation costs    and purported security benefits over SMS 2FA. However, users of TOTP 2FA    apps face a critical usability challenge: maintain access to the secrets    stored within the TOTP app, or risk getting locked out of their    accounts. To help users avoid this fate, popular TOTP apps implement a    wide range of backup mechanisms, each with varying security and privacy    implications. In this paper, we define an assessment methodology for    conducting systematic security and privacy analyses of the backup and    recovery functionality of TOTP apps. We identified all general purpose    Android TOTP apps in the Google Play Store with at least 100k installs    that implemented a backup mechanism (n = 22). Our findings show that    most backup strategies end up placing trust in the same technologies    that TOTP 2FA is meant to supersede: passwords, SMS, and email. Many    backup implementations shared personal user information with third    parties, had serious cryptographic flaws, and/or allowed the app    developers to access the TOTP secrets in plaintext.

Specifically, forward secrecy can guarantee the confidentiality    of those previously encrypted emails even if the user's secret key gets    exposed. However, due to the failure to meet the security and    practicality requirements of email systems simultaneously, typical    methods of achieving forward secrecy, such as Diffie-Hellman key    exchange and forward-secure public-key encryption, have not been widely    approved and adopted. In this article, to capture forward secrecy of    encrypted cloud email systems without sacrificing the practicability, we    introduce a new cryptographic primitive named forward-secure puncturable    identity-based encryption (fs-PIBE), which enables an email user to    perform fine-grained revocation of decryption capacity. In more detail,    the user is allowed to preserve the decryption capacity of unreceived    encrypted emails, while abolishing that of those received ones. Thus, it    provides more practical forward secrecy than typical manners, in which    the decryption capacity of received and unreceived encrypted emails is    revoked simultaneously. Based on such a primitive, we build a framework    of encrypted cloud email systems, and instantiate it with a concrete    fs-PIBE construction that has constant size of ciphertext and provable    security in the standard model. Furthermore, to improve the security and    efficiency of the presented framework, we extend the proposed fs-PIBE    scheme to support end-to-end encryption and outsourced decryption,    respectively. In addition, as a proof-of-concept of the proposed fs-PIBE    scheme, we implement it and produce various experiments to demonstrate    its practicability and correctness.",IEEE COMPUTER SOC,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",Article,English,"Chen, XF (Corresponding Author), Xidian Univ, State Key Lab Integrated Serv Networks ISN, Xian 710071, Peoples R China.

Social    engineering, which involves manipulating people to disclose confidential    information, attacks computer system users as the weakest security link.    The user contributes greatly to this phenomenon through his reckless and    conscienceless behaviour. Raising users' awareness of social engineers'    potential tricks against them has proven to be one of the most effective    security measures. In order to be able to oppose social engineering at    all, it is necessary to have a valid and reliable method of assessing    the risky behaviour and level of information security awareness of the    typical user. The research aimed to develop and validate a new Croatian    version of a measurement instrument for social engineering research: the    Behavioural-Cognitive Internet Security Questionnaire (BCISQ). Students    of the J. J. Strossmayer University in Osijek (N=287) participated in    this study. They have completed the BCISQ online through specially    designed software. The BCISQ consists of 4 subscales, the first two    examining the behavioural component (self-assessment and simulation of    risky online behaviour) and the other two measuring the cognitive    component of cybersecurity (awareness of online risks and the importance    of safe computer systems use). The results showed that real (simulated)    risky online behaviour of users is not related to their own assessments;    that is, their self-assessments differ from their actual behaviour in    the virtual world. Moreover, although most users have a quite high level    of awareness of the potential online risks, a large number of them have    entered their email address (20.9 \%), and an even greater number have    left their password to access the same (61.7 \%). The BCISQ has proven    to be a reliable and valid measurement instrument with good psychometric    characteristics.

The manual process of user identification and authentication    is time-consuming and tedious. The proposed research work aims to    overcome this drawback and achieve user identification and    authentication through an automated method using the Aadhar card. Aadhar    project is developed by the Unique Identification Authority of India by    merging biometrics and digitization. The details are stored in the form    of a quick response code along with a 12-digit Aadhar card number. A    model is built to capture the information from the Aadhar card. The    mobile phones are used to obtain the data from the Aadhar card. The user    validation is through two-step process using One Time Password and email    address. The wireless public key infrastructure issues a digital    certificate to the valid user. The proposed authentication and symmetric    key exchange algorithm are formally verified and analyzed using    automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications.    The result of simulation proves that the proposed scheme is secure and    safe. The experimental results show that time consumption for user    authentication is acceptable. The acceptance of the proposed automated    user identification and authentication model is authorized using a    modified technology acceptance model. The result proves that there    exists a strong relationship between the perceived usefulness of items    and the Attribute Of Use (AOU). It also exhibits that the association    between the AOU and user satisfaction is influential. The model    demonstrates that the association between the Perceived Ease Of Use and    attribute towards use is weak. The influence of exogenous variables over    endogenous variables exhibits that the proposed model outperforms the    traditional manual system and the target users are inclined towards it.

USENIX Assoc,Privilege messaging: An authorization framework over email    infrastructure,,2006,,BFY26,1+,,"The current email infrastructure is burdened by multiple resource    constraints and a plethora of security issues. Apart from the fact that    email users are spending more time and effort sifting through    unsolicited emails, more serious problems such as Phishing are on the    rise. This can be attributed to a fundamental shortcoming in the current    email infrastructure: a lack of an authorization framework. This allows    any user to create content in anyone's mailbox. In this paper, we    revisit the fundamental problem of non-existent authorization and    discuss the design of an effective authorization service overlaying the    existing email infrastructure. We propose Privilege Messaging    (P-Messaging), a fine-granular authorization framework that operates on    the principle that a sender requires a set of privileges in order to    send messages, simultaneously enables the receiver's infrastructure    server to verify the messages before accepting it. We present a    prototype implementation and discuss its benefits. An automatic    classification of email can be effectively performed based on the    privilege-tag. Privilege-tag can provide flexible and fine-granular    reputation management than current domain-based solutions. The use of    privilege-tag as entry ID in a white-list can be more manageable than    the use of individual email address. Finally, the privilege-tag can be    used as an email header, retaining the benefits of currently deployed    MTA architecture, namely reliability and flexibility.",USENIX ASSOC,"SUITE 215, 2560 NINTH ST, BERKELEY, CA 94710 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Kang, BHB (Corresponding Author), Univ N Carolina, Charlotte, NC 27515 USA.

IEEE,Staying Secure and Unprepared: Understanding and Mitigating the Security    Risks of Apple ZeroConf,,2016,,,655-674,,"With the popularity of today's usability-oriented designs, dubbed Zero    Configuration or ZeroConf, unclear are the security implications of    these automatic service discovery, ``plug-and-play{''} techniques. In    this paper, we report the first systematic study on this issue, focusing    on the security features of the systems related to Apple, the major    proponent of ZeroConf techniques. Our research brings to light a    disturbing lack of security consideration in these systems' designs:    major ZeroConf frameworks on the Apple platforms, including the Core    Bluetooth Framework, Multipeer Connectivity and Bonjour, are mostly    unprotected and popular apps and system services, such as Tencent QQ,    Apple Handoff, printer discovery and AirDrop, turn out to be completely    vulnerable to an impersonation or Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, even    though attempts have been made to protect them against such threats. The    consequences are serious, allowing a malicious device to steal the    user's SMS messages, email notifications, documents to be printed out or    transferred to another device. Most importantly, our study highlights    the fundamental security challenges underlying ZeroConf techniques: in    the absence of any pre-configured secret across different devices,    authentication has to rely on Apple-issued public-key certificate, which    however cannot be properly verified due to the difficulty in finding a    unique, nonsensitive and widely known identity of a human user to bind    her to her certificate. To address this issue, we developed a suite of    new techniques, including a conflict detection approach and a biometric    technique that enables the user to speak out her certificate through 6    distinct, rare but pronounceable words to let those who know her voice    verify her certificate. We performed a security analysis on the new    protection and evaluated its usability and effectiveness using two user    studies involving 60 participants. Our research shows that the new    protection fits well with the existing ZeroConf systems such as AirDrop.    It is well received by users and also providing effective defense even    against recently proposed speech synthesis attacks.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Bai, XL (Corresponding Author), Tsinghua Univ, TNList, Beijing, Peoples R China.

IEEE,Email Worm Detection by Wavelet Analysis of DNS Query Streams,,2009,,,53+,,"The high prevalence of email worms indicates that current in-network    defence mechanisms are incapable of mitigating this Internet threat.    Moreover, commonly applied approaches against this class of propagating    malicious program do not target reducing unwanted email traffic    traversing the Internet. In this paper, we take a step toward better    understanding of email worms, and explore their effect on the flow-level    characteristics of Domain Name System (DNS) query streams that user    machines generate. We propose a novel method, which uses time series    analysis and unsupervised learning, to detect email worms as they appear    on local name servers. To evaluate our detection method, we have    constructed a DNS query dataset that consists of 71 email worms. We    demonstrate that our method is very effective.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Chatzis, N (Corresponding Author), Fraunhofer Inst FOKUS, Kaiserin Augusta Allee 31, D-10589 Berlin, Germany.

DesTech Publ Inc,Integrating SELinux with security-typed languages,,2007,,,85-92,,"Traditionally, operating systems have enforced MAC and in,formation flow    policies with minimal dependence on application programs. However there    are many cases where systems depend on user-level programs to enforce    information flows. Previous approaches to handling this problem, such as    privilege-separation of application components or assuming trust in    application information flow enforcement, are prone to error and    cumbersome to manage. On the other hand, recent advances in the area of    security-typed languages have enabled the development of realistic    applications with formally and automatically verified information flow    controls. In this paper, we examine what it takes to integrate    information flow enforcement of applications written in a security-typed    extension of Java (called Jif) with SELinux. To this end, we have    extended the Jif infrastructure to support interaction with SELinux    security contexts, and we describe the SELinux policy and system calls    which are necessary for a successful integration. We have also    identified the need for further services, such as a means of formally    verifying compliance between information flow policies. We have    demonstrated the utility, flexibility and security of our approach by    constructing a prototype multi-level secure email client.","DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC","439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Hicks, B (Corresponding Author), Penn State Univ, Syst \& Internet Infrastruct Secur Lab SIIS, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.

USENIX ASSOC,Distrust of big tech and a desire for privacy: Understanding the    motivations of people who have voluntarily adopted secure email,,2023,,BV7II,473-490,,"Secure email systems that use end-to-end encryption are the best method    we have for ensuring user privacy and security in email communication.    However, the adoption of secure email remains low, with previous studies    suggesting mainly that secure email is too complex or inconvenient to    use. However, the perspectives of those who have, in fact, chosen to use    an encrypted email system are largely overlooked. To understand these    perspectives, we conducted a semi-structured interview study that aims    to provide a comprehensive understanding of the mindsets underlying    adoption and use of secure email services. Our participants come from a    variety of countries and vary in the amount of time they have been using    secure email, how often they use it, and whether they use it as their    primary account. Our results uncover that a defining reason for adopting    a secure email system is to avoid surveillance from big tech companies.    However, regardless of the complexity and accuracy of a person's mental    model, our participants rarely send and receive encrypted emails, thus    not making full use of the privacy they could obtain. These findings    indicate that secure email systems could potentially find greater    adoption by appealing to their privacy advantages, but privacy gains    will be limited until a critical mass are able to join these systems and    easily send encrypted emails to each other.",USENIX ASSOC,"SUITE 215, 2560 NINTH ST, BERKELEY, CA 94710 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Usman, W (Corresponding Author), Brigham Young Univ, Provo, UT 84602 USA.

IEEE COMP SOC,27 Years and 81 Million Opportunities Later: Investigating the Use of    Email Encryption for an Entire University,,2022,,,860-875,,"Email is one of the main communication tools and has seen significant    adoption in the past decades. However, emails are sent in plain text by    default and allow attackers easy access. Users can protect their emails    by end-to-end encrypting them using tools such as S/MIME or PGP.    Although PGP had already been introduced in 1991, it is a commonly held    belief that email encryption is a niche tool that has not seen    widespread adoption to date. Previous user studies identified ample    usability issues with email encryption such as key management and user    interface challenges, which likely contribute to the limited success of    email encryption.    However, so far ground truth based on longitudinal field data is missing    in the literature. Towards filling this gap, we measure the use of email    encryption based on 27 years of data for 37,089 users at a large    university. While attending to ethical and data privacy concerns, we    were able to analyze the use of S/MIME and PGP in 81,612,595 emails.    We found that only 5.46\% of all users ever used S/MIME or PGP. This led    to 0.06\% encrypted and 2.8\% signed emails. Users were more likely to    use S/MIME than PGP by a factor of six. We saw that using multiple email    clients had a negative impact on signing as well as encrypting emails    and that only 3.36\% of all emails between S/MIME users who had    previously exchanged certificates were encrypted on average.    Our results imply that the adoption of email encryption is indeed very    low and that key management challenges negatively impact even users who    have set up S/MIME or PGP previously.",IEEE COMPUTER SOC,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Stransky, C (Corresponding Author), Leibniz Univ Hannover, Hannover, Germany.

USENIX Assoc,Leaky Forms: A Study of Email and Password Exfiltration Before Form    Submission,,2022,,BT8TA,1813-1830,,"Web users enter their email addresses into online forms for a variety of    reasons, including signing in or signing up for a service or subscribing    to a newsletter. While enabling such functionality, email addresses    typed into forms can also be collected by third-party scripts even when    users change their minds and leave the site without submitting the form.    Email addresses-or identifiers derived from them-are known to be used by    data brokers and advertisers for cross-site, cross-platform, and    persistent identification of potentially unsuspecting individuals. In    order to find out whether access to online forms is misused by online    trackers, we present a measurement of email and password collection that    occurs before the form submission on the top 100, 000 websites. We    evaluate the effect of user location, browser configuration, and    interaction with consent dialogs by comparing results across two vantage    points (EU/US), two browser configurations (desktop/mobile), and three    consent modes. Our crawler finds and fills email and password fields,    monitors the network traffic for leaks, and intercepts script access to    filled input fields. Our analyses show that users' email addresses are    exfiltrated to tracking, marketing and analytics domains before form    submission and without giving consent on 1, 844 websites in the EU crawl    and 2, 950 websites in the US crawl. While the majority of email    addresses are sent to known tracking domains, we further identify 41    tracker domains that are not listed by any of the popular blocklists.

In contrast to standard mailing systems    like e-Mail, certified mail systems provide the secure, reliable and    evidential exchange of messages with the quality of traditional postal    registered or certified mail. Most of these systems are tailored to    national laws, policies, needs and technical requirements and are thus    closed and only accessible by certain user groups. However, the ongoing    globalization and opening of the markets, especially in the European    Union, ask for global certified mailing as already known from e-Mail.    Interoperability of certified mail systems is a new and challenging    research field. This article presents a framework and standard to make    arbitrary certified mail systems interoperable. The presented approach    uses a federated trust network of so-called electronic delivery gateways    for seamless certified mailing across systems. This is achieved by    converting protocols and system specifics on different layers using a    harmonized interoperability protocol. The presented framework has been    standardized by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute    (ETSI) as Registered Electronic Mail specification for interoperable    certified mail systems.

Potential participant registries represent an    increasingly common intervention to overcome this barrier. A variety of    models for registries exist, but few data are available to instruct    their design and implementation. To provide such data, we surveyed 110    cognitively normal research participants enrolled in a longitudinal    study of aging and dementia. Seventy-four (67\%) individuals    participated in the study. Most (78\%, CI: 0.67, 0.87) participants were    likely to enroll in a registry. Willingness to participate was reduced    for registries that required enrollment through the Internet using a    password (26\%, CI: 0.16, 0.36) or through email (38\%, CI: 0.27, 0.49).    Respondents acknowledged their expectations that researchers share    information about their health and risk for disease and their concerns    that their data could be shared with for-profit companies. We found no    difference in respondent preferences for registries that shared contact    information with researchers, compared to honest broker models that take    extra precautions to protect registrant confidentiality (28\% versus    30\%; p = 0.46). Compared to those preferring a shared information    model, respondents who preferred the honest broker model or who lacked    model preference voiced increased concerns about sharing registrant    data, especially with for-profit organizations. These results suggest    that the design of potential participant registries may impact the    population enrolled, and hence the population that will eventually be    enrolled in clinical studies.

The field of `usable security' already started to    emerge in the mid-90s, primarily focussed on password and email    security. Later on, the research field of ``usable security and    privacy{''} evolved and broadened the aim to design concepts and tools    to assist users in enhancing their behaviour with regard to both privacy    and security. Nevertheless, many user interventions are not as effective    as desired. Because of highly diverse usage contexts, leading to    different privacy and security requirements and not always to    one-size-fits-all approaches, tailorability is necessary to address this    issue. Furthermore, transparency is a crucial requirement, as providing    comprehensible information may counter reactance towards security    interventions. This article first provides a brief history of the    research field in its first quarter-century and then highlights research    on the transparency and tailorability of user interventions. Based on    this, this article then presents six contributions with regard to (1)    privacy concerns in times of COVID-19, (2) authentication on mobile    devices, (3) GDPR-compliant data management, (4) privacy notices on    websites, (5) data disclosure scenarios in agriculture, as well as (6)    rights under data protection law and the concrete process should data    subjects want to claim those rights.

ASSOC COMP MACHINERY,Mitigation of Attacks on Email End-to-End Encryption,,2020,,,1647-1664,,"OpenPGP and S/MIME are two major standards for securing email    communication introduced in the early 1990s. Three recent classes of    attacks exploit weak cipher modes (EFAIL Malleability Gadgets, or    EFAIL-MG), the flexibility of the MIME email structure (EFAIL Direct    Exfiltration, or EFAIL-DE), and the Reply action of the email client    (REPLY attacks). Although all three break message confidentiality by    using standardized email features, only EFAIL-MG has been mitigated in    IETF standards with the introduction of Authenticated Encryption with    Associated Data (AEAD) algorithms. So far, no uniform and reliable    countermeasures have been adopted by email clients to prevent EFAIL-DE    and REPLY attacks. Instead, email clients implement a variety of    different ad-hoc countermeasures which are only partially effective,    cause interoperability problems, and fragment the secure email    ecosystem.    We present the first generic countermeasure against both REPLY and    EFAIL-DE attacks by checking the decryption context including SMTP    headers and MIME structure during decryption. The decryption context is    encoded into a string DC and used as Associated Data (AD) in the AEAD    encryption. Thus the proposed solution seamlessly extends the EFAIL-MG    countermeasures. The decryption context changes whenever an attacker    alters the email source code in a critical way, for example, if the    attacker changes the MIME structure or adds a new Reply-To header. The    proposed solution does not cause any interoperability problems and    legacy emails can still be decrypted. We evaluate our approach by    implementing the decryption contexts in Thunderbird/Enigmail and by    verifying their correct functionality after the email has been    transported over all major email providers, including Gmail and iCloud    Mail.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Proceedings Paper,English,"Schwenk, J (Corresponding Author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Bochum, Germany.

ACM,Email Typosquatting,,2017,,,419-431,,"While website domain typosquatting is highly annoying for legitimate    domain operators, research has found that it relatively rarely presents    a great risk to individual users. However, any application (e.g., email,    ftp, ...) relying on the domain name system for name resolution is    equally vulnerable to domain typosquatting, and consequences may be more    dire than with website typosquatting.    This paper presents the first in-depth measurement study of email    typosquatting. Working in concert with our IRB, we registered 76    typosquatting domain names to study a wide variety of user mistakes,    while minimizing the amount of personal information exposed to us. In    the span of over seven months, we received millions of emails at our    registered domains. While most of these emails are spam, we infer, from    our measurements, that every year, three of our domains should receive    approximately 3,585 ``legitimate{''} emails meant for somebody else.    Worse, we find, by examining a small sample of all emails, that these    emails may contain sensitive information (e.g., visa documents or    medical records).    We then project from our measurements that 1,211 typosquatting domains    registered by unknown entities receive in the vicinity of 800,000 emails    a year. Furthermore, we find that millions of registered typosquatting    domains have MX records pointing to only a handful of mail servers.    However, a second experiment in which we send ``honey emails{''} to    typosquatting domains only shows very limited evidence of attempts at    credential theft (despite some emails being read), meaning that the    threat, for now, appears to remain theoretical.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Szurdi, J (Corresponding Author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.

ASSOC COMP MACHINERY,IvoriWatch: Exploring Transparent Integrity Verification of Remote User    Input Leveraging Wearables,,2020,,,706-716,,"Several sensitive operations, such as financial transactions, email    construction, configurations of safety-critical devices (e.g., medical    devices or smart home systems), are often performed via web interfaces    from a host machine, usually a desktop or laptop PC. It is typically    easy to secure the communication link between the local host machine and    the remote server, for example, via a standard cryptographic protocol    (e.g., TLS). However, if the host machine itself is compromised with a    trojan or malware, the malicious adversary can manipulate the    user-provided input (e.g., money transfer information, email content and    configuration data) that can lead to severe consequences, including    financial loss, damage of reputation, security breach, and even put    human lives in danger.    In this paper, we introduce the notion of integrity verification for the    user-provided input leveraging a wrist-worn wearable device (e.g., a    watch or a bracelet). Specifically, we propose IvoriWatch(1), a    transparent and secure integrity verification mechanism, that inspects    the user-provided input from a compromised host machine to a remote    server for its integrity before acting upon the input. IvoriWatch    requires the user to wear a wrist-wearable (either on one hand or both    hands for better security). It verifies the validity of the    payload/input received at the remote server by comparing it (i.e., the    corresponding sequence of keyboard regions - left or right) with the    predicted ones based on the wrist motions captured by the    wrist-wearable. Only when the user input sufficiently correlates with    the wrist motion data, the input is considered legitimate. We build a    prototype implementation of IvoriWatch on an Android smartwatch as the    wrist-wearable and a desktop PC terminal as a host machine, and evaluate    it under benign and adversarial settings. Our results suggest that    IvoriWatch can correctly detect the legitimacy of the input in the    benign setting, and the manipulated as well as unintended input from a    malicious program in the adversarial settings with minimal errors.    Although IvoriWatch uses wrist movements for integrity verification, it    is not a biometric scheme.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Shrestha, P (Corresponding Author), Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.

ACM,A Comparative Long-Term Study of Fallback Authentication Schemes,,2024,,,,,"Fallback authentication, the process of re-establishing access to an    account when the primary authenticator is unavailable, holds critical    signifcance. Approaches range from secondary channels like email and SMS    to personal knowledge questions (PKQs) and social authentication. A key    diference to primary authentication is that the duration between    enrollment and authentication can be much longer, typically months or    years. However, few systems have been studied over extended timeframes,    making it difcult to know how well these systems truly help users    recover their accounts. We also lack meaningful comparisons of schemes    as most prior work examined two mechanisms at most. We report the    results of a long-term user study of the usability of fallback    authentication over 18 months to provide a fair comparison of the four    most commonly used fallback authentication methods.

IEEE,Survey of Non-malicious User Actions that Introduce Network and System    Vulnerabilities and Exploits,,2018,,,,,"Security is a growing concern in modern computer networks. Despite the    implementation of significant security measures, a network can still be    exposed to attackers by the actions of its users. Both attackers and    penetration testers use social engineering tactics to exploit the    mistakes made by users. For example, a user being tricked into clicking    on a malicious link in a phishing email. Network security administrators    seek ways to prevent intrusion into the network initiated by users    performing such risky actions, and use methodologies to detect and    respond safely when those actions occur. If we were able to simulate    these user actions in a controlled network, it would help prepare    networks to be sufficiently hardened to prevent exposure. The goal of    this paper is to seek out different ways users create vulnerabilities,    and use that information to determine the feasibility of replicating    them in a network as semi-autonomous agents for evaluating security. We    seek to determine existing research on network breaches caused by    unwitting-users, the common and current exploits attackers use to trick    users, and the mitigations that can prevent intrusion into the network.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Robles, A (Corresponding Author), Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Coll Comp \& Informat, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.

These tools allow users    to conveniently share news stories and information about products and    services of interest to friends, family and colleagues via email.    Information sharing on the Web is a phenomenon that has attracted the    attention of Internet marketers who are interested in extending and    fine-tuning their Web-based advertising campaigns. Although many    commercial websites include sharing tools, their characteristics have    not yet been systematically examined.    This paper reports on an exploratory study of the design and functional    features of sharing tools on a sample of 11 American newspaper websites.    The sharing toot were examined to gather data about their appearance,    location, and features provided to both senders and recipients of    generated email messages. Additionally, sample news stories were    ``shared{''} with one of the authors using each of the sharing tools,    and data about the appearance and content of these messages were    collected. The major findings of the study suggest that on the sampled    websites: (1) there is lack of standardization in the visual design and    placement of the sharing tools, (2) insufficient information is provided    to the user about how to use the tool, (3) written details about the    security of users' and senders' privacy are absent or incomplete, and    (4) many tools lack the ability to be user-customized, and are not    convenient to use.

These browsers use client    side efficiency measures such as larger cache storage and fewer plugins.    However, the impact on data security of such measures is an understudied    area. In this paper, we propose an adversary model to examine the    security of lightweight browsers. Using the adversary model, we reveal    previously unpublished vulnerabilities in four popular light browsers,    namely: UC Browser, Dolphin, CM Browser, and Samsung Stock Browser,    which allows an attacker to obtain unauthorized access to the user's    private data. The latter include browser history, email content, and    bank account details. For example, we also demonstrate that it is    possible to replace the images of the cache in one of the browsers,    which can be used to facilitate phishing and other fraudulent    activities. By identifying the design flaw in these browsers (i.e.    improper file storage), we hope that future browser designers can avoid    similar errors. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

"Devarakonda, Aruna Kumari and Tummala, Prasamsa and Sandrala, Indra    Praveen",Security Solutions to the Phishing: Transactions Based on Security    Questions and Image,,2010,70,,565-567,,"One of the latest computer-related problems to arise is phishing, which    is the criminally fraudulent process in which e-mails lure unsuspecting    victims into giving up user names, passwords, Social Security numbers,    and account information after linking to counterfeit bank, credit card,    and e-commerce Web sites. Phishers are mainly targeting the customers of    banks and online payment services. It is so pervasive that even    corporate and government sites are actively informing the users on this    issue. This paper presents a solution, which aims to protect users    against email phishing attacks. Main key words which are used are a user    ID and password, and the other is an authenticating question. An e-mail    that a bank sends to user contains some image and preselected question    which the phisher couldn't have, that the user chose when setting up the    account. This proves to the user that the e-mail came from the bank or    business, not a phisher, and that it is safe to use the provided link.    The user is asked to provide his ID and the bank checks if the ID is    valid or not. If the ID is valid, the user is asked to load the image    which has been mailed and answer his preselected question along with a    request for their logon password. After receiving the correct password,    user is allowed to access the Web site.",SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",Proceedings Paper,English,"Devarakonda, AK (Corresponding Author), Koneru Lakshmaiah Univ, Dept Elect \& Comp Engn, Tadepalli 522502, MD, India.

However, current MFA    methods, such as OffPAD, One-Time Password Tokens (OTT), and    smartcard-based systems, remain vulnerable to attacks like    Man-in-the-Middle (MITM), session hijacking, replay, phishing, and    denial of service (DoS). Additionally, the conventional single-server    authentication approach is inefficient and inadequate for modern    security needs. This study introduces Secure Multi-Factor Authentication    (SMFA), a novel framework designed to address these challenges by    leveraging steganography for secure credential transmission, reducing    susceptibility to MITM and session hijacking attacks. SMFA also    incorporates an additional Universal Serial Bus (USB) device as a    supplementary authentication factor and employs a multi-server    architecture to overcome the limitations of single-server models. A    comprehensive analysis comparing SMFA to existing MFA protocols reveals    its superior ability to counter MITM, replay, DoS, user impersonation,    and password-guessing attacks. The results demonstrate that SMFA offers    a robust and effective solution, addressing the weaknesses of both    traditional password-based systems and current MFA methods.",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Article,English,"Sarower, AH (Corresponding Author), Daffodil Int Univ, Dept Comp Sci \& Engn, Dhaka 1216, Bangladesh.

"Miao, Qiguang and Tang, Xing and Quan, Yining",A Novel Email Virus Propagation Model with Local Group,,2014,,,331-336,,"Several email virus models have been proposed in previous papers.    Usually, users in these models are homogeneous and symmetric which fail    to model the real situation accurately. In this paper, a novel model    with local group is presented. In real email system, users will usually    group their contacts into various kinds of groups. Moreover, users have    different levels of security awareness according to different closeness    with certain group. To model the condition, we propose the propagation    model with local group. In our model, a user is modeled as an autonomy    agent who is able to deal with email and group its ego network. Based on    the local group algorithm, open probability is carefully defined    overcoming the disadvantage of homogeneous model. Applying our model on    benchmark networks, we use the space-time diagrams for a small network    and curve graph for real email network to verify our model. Simulations    indicate that users will not be infected until his close friend group    mostly being infected, showing that the group provides buffer for virus    spreading. On the other hand, in accordance with the local group action    in reality, the propagation is largely deferred compared with the    homogeneous model.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Miao, QG (Corresponding Author), Xidian Univ, Sch Comp Sci \& Technol, Xian 710071, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.

"Steves, Michelle and Greene, Kristen and Theofanos, Mary",Categorizing human phishing difficulty: a Phish Scale,JOURNAL OF CYBERSECURITY,2020,6,tyaa009,,SEP 14,"As organizations continue to invest in phishing awareness training    programs, many chief information security officers (CISOs) are concerned    when their training exercise click rates are high or variable, as they    must justify training budgets to organization officials who question the    efficacy of awareness training when click rates are not declining. We    argue that click rates should be expected to vary based on the    difficulty of the phishing email for a target audience. Past research    has shown that when the premise of a phishing email aligns with a user's    work context, it is much more challenging for users to detect a phish.    Given this, we propose a Phish Scale, so CISOs and phishing training    implementers can easily rate the difficulty of their phishing exercises    and help explain associated click rates. We base our scale on past    research in phishing cues and user context, and apply the scale to    previously published and new data from enterprise-based phishing    exercises. The Phish Scale performed well with the current phishing    dataset, but future work is needed to validate it with a larger variety    of phishing emails.

Email spam, commonly known as junk email, continues to pose a    significant challenge in the digital realm, inundating inboxes with    unsolicited and often irrelevant messages. This relentless influx of    spam not only disrupts user productivity but also raises security    concerns, as it frequently serves as a vehicle for phishing attempts,    malware distribution, and other cyber threats. The prevalence of spam is    fueled by its low-cost dissemination and its ability to reach a wide    audience, exploiting vulnerabilities in email systems. This paper marks    the inception of an in-depth investigation into the viability and    potential implementation of a robust spam filtering and prevention    system tailored explicitly to university networks. With the escalating    threat of email-based hacking attacks and the incessant deluge of spam,    the need for a comprehensive and effective defense mechanism within    academic institutions becomes increasingly imperative. In exploring    potential solutions, this study delves into the applicability and    efficacy of Bayesian filters, a class of probabilistic classifiers    renowned for their aptitude in distinguishing between legitimate emails    and spam messages.

However, uncertainty about the    extent of these adjustments can hinder their effectiveness. To address    this, we developed the Job Adjustment mobile app, which allows users to    input job and health details to generate a variety of personalized    action plans. As this is the first version of the app, assessing its    feasibility and usability is crucial. Objective: This study aims to    verify the feasibility and usability of the Job Adjustment mobile app.    Methods: A longitudinal observational study was conducted on pregnant    Japanese women who were allowed to use the app anytime from 12 to 34    weeks of gestation; they received reminder emails every 2 weeks    encouraging app use. A questionnaire was administered before app use and    at 20 and 32 weeks of gestation. Feasibility was evaluated across 4    domains: implementation, demand, acceptability, and adverse events.    Implementation was evaluated based on 3 parameters: dropout rate,    initial reminder email receipt rate, and adherence rate (measured as    pregnant women who used the app at intervals of 2.5 weeks or less).    Demand was measured by intervals between use and intervals between    log-in, and participants answered 15 questions to assess acceptability.    Adverse events were assessed by analyzing the degree of anxiety related    to work. Demographic data were analyzed to determine any statistically    significant differences in intervals between uses. Usability was    evaluated using the System Usability Scale. Results: The analysis    included 66 pregnant women, and 61\% (n=40) of them were multipara. The    dropout rate, adherence rate, and initial reminder email receipt rate    were 18\% (13/71), 44\% (29/66), and 79\% (52/66) respectively. The    median intervals between use and intervals between log-in were 2.94 (IQR    2.00-5.13) weeks and 2.28 (IQR 1.81-4.00) weeks, respectively. Overall,    60\% (35/58) to 90\% (52/58) of the participants responded positively to    all 15 questions assessing acceptability, and no anxiety regarding work    was recorded. The mean System Usability Scale score was 66.1 points.    Multipara women had significantly longer Conclusions: The results    demonstrated acceptable levels of feasibility and usability of the app.    However, the low adherence rates, especially among multipara women,    suggest the need for modifications to reduce the time burden of the app.    Further research should explore more effective and acceptable intervals    between use and timing, involving a larger sample and accounting for    diverse characteristics of pregnant women.

ACM,Investigation into the Security and Privacy of iOS VPN Applications,,2020,,A40,,,"Due to the increasing number of recommendations for people to use    Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to protect their privacy, more    application developers are creating VPN applications and publishing them    on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. In this `gold rush',    applications are being developed quickly and, in turn, not being    developed with security in mind.    This paper investigated a selection of VPN applications available on the    Apple App Store (for iOS devices) and tested the applications for    security and privacy issues. This includes testing for any traffic being    transmitted over plain HTTP, DNS leakage and transmission of personally    identifiable information (such as phone number, International Mobile    Equipment Identity (IMEI), email address, MAC address) and evaluating    the security of the tunneling protocol used by the VPN.    The testing methodology involved installing VPN applications on a test    device, simulating network traffic for a pre-defined period of time and    capturing the traffic. This allows for all traffic to be analysed to    check for anything being sent without encryption. Other issues that    often cause de-anonymization with VPN applications such as DNS leakage    were also considered.    The research found several common security issues with VPN applications    tested, with a large majority of applications still using HTTP and not    HTTPS for transmitting certain data. A large majority of the VPN    applications failed to route additional user data (such as DNS queries)    through the VPN tunnel. Furthermore, just fifteen of the tested    applications were found to have correctly implemented the    best-recommended tunneling protocol for user security.    Outside of the regular testing criteria, other security anomalies were    observed with specific applications, which included outdated servers    with known vulnerabilities, applications giving themselves the ability    to perform HTTPS interception and questionable privacy policies.    From the documented vulnerabilities, this research proposes a set of    recommendations for developers to consider when developing VPN    applications.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Proceedings Paper,English,"Wilson, J (Corresponding Author), Abertay Univ, Div Cybersecur, Dundee, Scotland.

Due to their unique characteristics, human    drivers possess varying hazard perception skills and interaction    preferences, making personalized assistance crucial to improving the    user experience and system acceptance. However, how to leverage    multimodal interfaces that dynamically adapt to warning contents and    driver characteristics remains an open question. At the same time, large    language models (LLMs) have demonstrated advanced capabilities in    knowledge acquisition, planning, and human-machine collaboration,    offering potential solutions for existing warning systems. Thus, we    develop an LLM-based personalized driver agent (PDA), which provides    personalized warnings through multimodal interactions (visual, voice,    and tactile). The agent's architecture mimics human cognitive processes    via four core modules: memory, perception, control, and action. Results    from our experiments indicate that the LLM-PDA effectively customizes    warning contents for different drivers in various situations, providing    enhanced safety and driver support. This article pioneers the    integration of LLMs into automotive human-vehicle interaction and offers    novel insights into personalized human-machine interaction in    intelligent vehicles.",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Article; Early Access,English,"Chen, TT (Corresponding Author), Korea Adv Inst Sci \& Technol, Cho Chun Shik Grad Sch Mobil, Daejeon 34141, South Korea.

In order to distinguish    between human users and bots, the Completely Automatic Public Turing    Test (CAPTCHA) has been used for almost 20 years. Nevertheless, CAPTCHA    can be easily broken if it lacks security features. Consequently, the    motivation for utilizing CAPTCHA is undermined. This article proposes a    framework that can evaluate the security aspects of text CAPTCHAs. The    effectiveness of the framework is validated by using a generalized    attack method consisting of pre-processing and utilizing an Optical    Character Recognition (OCR) library such as Tesseract OCR. We have    carried out a systematic study of existing CAPTCHAs utilized on    Bangladeshi websites. We have studied 238 Bangladeshi websites and found    that only 44 websites used a CAPTCHA mechanism. Then, we have assessed    the security levels of the selected text CAPTCHAs by the proposed    framework. As per our analysis, we have found that there are 29    different CAPTCHA schemes being adopted on Bangladeshi websites and    among them 23 are vulnerable to automated attacks.

These risks were detected with a novel approach to    information security. It is based on the philosophy that information    security risk monitoring should include human and societal factors, and    that collaboration between organisations and experts is essential to    gain knowledge about potential risks. The methodology uses a mixed    methods approach including a quantitative analysis of historical    security incident data and expert elicitation through a Delphi study.    The result is an overview of the possible socio-technical risks that a    panel of experts expect to materialise in health care organisations in    the near future. These risks include (amongst others): staff leaving    data assets unattended on the premises and these assets consequently go    missing, staff sharing passwords to access patient data and staff    sending email containing personal patient data to the wrong addressee    thus disclosing data to unauthorised persons. The expert panel    recognized risks from current discussion topics such as outsourcing, but    these risks are still considered to appear less frequently than the more    traditional information security risks. Furthermore, the panel did not    estimate a high frequency of occurrence of socio-technical information    security risks caused by new technologies such as cloud computing or    RFID.

To ensure that the nodes within IoT can    interact securely, a certificateless signature (CLS) can be used to    protect message authentication in the IoT. Recently, some concrete    constructions of CLS schemes have been proposed in the literature, but    through our analyses, we demonstrate that some existing CLS schemes    cannot keep their claimed security because of various security flaws.    For example, a valid signature can be forged by any Type I adversary by    replacing the corresponding user's public key. In this article, we    describe the security flaws that need to be addressed and introduce a    novel CLS scheme without using bilinear mapping. The existential    unforgeability in our proposed scheme can be proved based on the    hardness of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem in the random    oracle model. The comparison with existing CLS schemes shows that our    scheme not only enjoys more security features but also is more efficient    in computation. Moreover, we introduce an identity authentication    protocol as the application of our proposed CLS scheme, which achieves    mutual authentication and anonymity in communications.",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Article,English,"Yang, B (Corresponding Author), Shaanxi Normal Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Xian 710062, Peoples R China.

While digital data uniquely captures    the totality of a person's communication, past research consistently    shows that a subset of contacts makes up a person's ``social network{''}    of unique resource providers. To address this gap, we analyzed the    correspondence between self-reported social network data and email    communication data with the objective of identifying the dynamics in    e-communication that correlate with a person's perception of a    significant network tie. First, we examined the predictive utility of    three popular methods to derive social network data from email data    based on volume and reciprocity of bilateral email exchanges. Second, we    observed differences in the response dynamics along self-reported ties,    allowing us to introduce and test a new method that incorporates    time-resolved exchange data. Using a range of robustness checks for    measurement and misreporting errors in self-report and email data, we    find that the methods have similar predictive utility. Although    e-communication has lowered communication costs with large numbers of    persons, and potentially extended our number of, and reach to contacts,    our case results suggest that underlying behavioral patterns indicative    of friendship or professional contacts continue to operate in a    classical fashion in email interactions.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",Article,English,"Wuchty, S (Corresponding Author), NIH, Natl Ctr Biotechnol Informat, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.

A    supervisory control server kept in a company can serve numerous Arduino    controllers to provide home security service. An Arduino controller is    used as a thin-controller to control a home security system. Most    control laws are computed in server-side, driving commands are    transferred to local controllers for execution. The Arduino controller    can sense door switch, motion detection, smoke detection, gas detection,    CO detection, and an emergency button, and can drive door lock, two    relays. Besides, RFID is used to help personnel in/out management and    alert enable/disable. The controller reads inputs, uploads input/output    data to the supervisory server, executes commands from the server, and    drives output continuously. Once a controller is connected to the    supervisory server, it can be monitored and controlled remotely.    Condition control is proposed for the framework to help program control    laws for Arduino controllers. In condition control, conditions are set.    When some condition is met, certain actions are taken. There are three    types of conditions; time condition, input/output condition, and    location condition. And there are three kinds of actions; SMS    notification, email notification, and output drive. Conditions, actions    and their connections are set by system users in a browser with the help    of the supervisory control information management system. The control    laws set in the condition control are executed in server-side. User of    the home security system can open the read/write rights of his    input/output points to other users. With appropriate control law, a    motion detection signal of one user can activate the alarm of another    user. Therefore, the home security service is not just a security for    user's home, but a security for a social group.",TRANS TECH PUBLICATIONS LTD,"Seestrasse 24c, BACH, SWITZERLAND",Proceedings Paper,English,"Tung, SC (Corresponding Author), Kun Shan Univ, Dept Environm Engn, Tainan 710, Taiwan.

Cyber threats include    everything from identity theft to malware threats and email and online    fraud. Thus, businesses and individuals should use risk assessment    methods and countermeasures to protect their m-banking apps. With this    in mind, a new model using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) has    been proposed. The model has been broken down into six main    countermeasure categories, namely: perceived risk, perceived security,    perceived trust, ease of use, usefulness and service quality. To test    this model, structural equation modelling (SEM) was used. Our findings    reveal that perceived security, perceived trust and service quality play    key roles in improving the adoption of mobile banking apps. In addition,    the findings indicate that perceived risk had a negative impact on both    clients' trust and their attitudes toward the use of mobile banking    services. The proposed model could increase the adoption of m-banking    apps by enhancing their defenses against security risk issues.

The problem    lies in the strategies used by the attacker in the electronic trap and    the lack of security awareness by the user at the same time. This paper    presents stages and steps of phishing email and investigates the most    tricking techniques used by the attacker to attract the user. The paper    also motivates work on non-technical solutions and reviews the types of    detection methods of phishing emails concentrating on methods related to    message contents.",SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",Proceedings Paper,English,"Ali, GA (Corresponding Author), Najran Univ, Coll Comp Sci \& Informat Syst, Dept Informat Syst, Najran, Saudi Arabia.

IEEE,Mobility Based Surveillance Model to Facilitate Security of Individuals'    Properties,,2014,,,103-107,,"World Wide statistics show the increasing number of properties such as    cars, house, and offices, in term of production and theft attempts.    There is a big international effort in research and industrial    production done to develop and produce security systems, but we still in    need for more improvement since the number of theft cases are still    increases. The thieves become more professional and inventing powerful    stealing techniques which require more effective security systems. This    research project tries to solve such problem by making use of the    advancement in mobility and electronic technologies to develop an    effective surveillance model. The proposed model integrates both    Monitoring and Tracking activities and offers effective communication    and controlling with owners, security units or police. It can send email    to the owner on his mobile to have fast response especially if the car    is nearby. Information about the property and the picture of the    intruder will be sent to user, security unit or police. This will help    police or security authorities in tracking property or car using GPS    system that can be link to Google Earth and other mapping software. The    implementation and testing results show the success of prototype in    sending email to owner and receiving acknowledgment to the security unit    or police within 3-4 minutes.

IEEE,A Mobile Security-related Behavior Prevention Model Based on Speech    Personality Traits,,2016,,,1803-1810,,"With the continuous development of mobile Internet, the damage due to    mobile security incidents is motivating system and security application    to adopt protective mechanisms. Recent research has begun to focus on    the correlation between personality traits and security-related behavior    such as email phishing response. In practical instances of this security    domain knowledge, acquiring the user's personality accurately and    conveniently in a mobile environment is desired. In this paper,    considering the high efficiency of speech personality assessment, a    prevention model using speech personality traits is proposed to    guarantee customized security services. Our model is based on multilayer    perceptron and prosodic features selection to acquire user speech    personality traits. Furthermore, by combining obtained personality    traits and security-related behavior domain knowledge, a prevention    strategy is proposed. The proposed prevention strategy, which design is    based on the correlation between user personality profile and security    behavior weaknesses, is used to provide customized security prevention    services. The results showed that the proposed model can achieve    superior performance than other state-of-the-art speech personality    assessment method and guarantee customized security-related behavior    prevention support according to personality traits.

Applying dual-process theories of cognition, we argue that a    brief mindfulness practice may prevent habitual responding to phishing    attempts by enhancing rational decision making and hence detecting    phishing cues. To empirically investigate this idea, we manipulated    mindfulness between two groups of participants in an experiment, and    measured the ability to detect phishing cues that are easy or difficult    to notice in emails from familiar or unfamiliar sources. Our findings    suggest that mindfulness helps to detect more phishing cues when emails    are difficult and from familiar sources, but not in any of the other    experimental conditions.

"Sawyer, Ben D. and Hancock, Peter A.",Hacking the Human: The Prevalence Paradox in Cybersecurity,HUMAN FACTORS,2018,60,5,597-609,AUG,"Objective: This work assesses the efficacy of the prevalence effect as a    form of cyberattack in human-automation teaming, using an email task.    Background: Under the prevalence effect, rare signals are more difficult    to detect, even when taking into account their proportionally low    occurrence. This decline represents diminished human capability to both    detect and respond. As signal probability (SP) approaches zero, accuracy    exhibits logarithmic decay. Cybersecurity, a context in which the    environment is entirely artificial, provides an opportunity to    manufacture conditions enhancing or degrading human performance, such as    prevalence effects. Email cybersecurity prevalence effects have not    previously been demonstrated, nor intentionally manipulated.    Method: The Email Testbed (ET) provides a simulation of a clerical email    work involving messages containing sensitive personal information. Using    the ET, participants were presented with 300 email interactions and    received cyberattacks at rates of either 1\%, 5\%, or 20\%.    Results: Results demonstrated the existence and power of prevalence    effects in email cybersecurity. Attacks delivered at a rate of 1\% were    significantly more likely to succeed, and the overall pattern of    accuracy across declining SP exhibited logarithmic decay.    Application: These findings suggest a prevalence paradox within    human-machine teams. As automation reduces attack SP, the human operator    becomes increasingly likely to fail in detecting and reporting attacks    that remain. In the cyber realm, the potential to artificially inflict    this state on adversaries, hacking the human operator rather than    algorithmic defense, is considered.

IEEE COMPUTER SOC,Pudding: Private User Discovery in Anonymity Networks,,2024,,BX6LJ,3203-3220,,"Anonymity networks allow messaging with meta-data privacy, providing    better privacy than popular encrypted messaging applications. However,    contacting a user on an anonymity network currently requires knowing    their public key or similar high-entropy information, as these systems    lack a privacy-preserving mechanism for contacting a user via a short,    human-readable username. Previous research suggests that this is a    barrier to widespread adoption.    In this paper we propose Pudding, a novel private user discovery    protocol that allows a user to be contacted on an anonymity network    knowing only their email address. Our protocol hides contact    relationships between users, prevents impersonation, and conceals which    usernames are registered on the network. Pudding is Byzantine fault    tolerant, remaining available and secure as long as less than one third    of servers are crashed, unavailable, or malicious. It can be deployed on    Loopix and Nym without changes to the underlying anonymity network    protocol, and it supports mobile devices with intermittent network    connectivity. We demonstrate the practicality of Pudding with a    prototype using the Nym anonymity network. We also formally define the    security and privacy goals of our protocol and conduct a thorough    analysis to assess its compliance with these definitions.",IEEE COMPUTER SOC,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Kocaogullar, C (Corresponding Author), Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, England.

ACM,An Investigation of Identity-Account Inconsistency in Single Sign-On,,2021,,,105-117,,"Single Sign-On (SSO) has been widely adopted for online authentication    due to its favorable usability and security. However, it also introduces    a single point of failure since all service providers fully trust the    identity of a user created by the SSO identity provider. In this paper,    we investigate the identity-account inconsistency threat, a new SSO    vulnerability that can cause the compromise of online accounts. The    vulnerability exists because current SSO systems highly rely on a user's    email address to bind an account with a real identity, but ignore the    fact that email addresses might be reused by other users. We reveal that    under the SSO authentication, such inconsistency allows an adversary    controlling a reused email address to take over associated online    accounts without knowing any credentials like passwords. Specifically,    we first conduct a measurement study on the account management policies    for multiple cloud email providers, showing the feasibility of acquiring    previously used email accounts. We further perform a systematic study on    100 popular websites using the Google business email service with our    own domain address and demonstrate that most online accounts can be    compromised by exploiting this inconsistency vulnerability. To shed    light on email reuse in the wild, we analyze the commonly used naming    conventions that lead to a wide existence of potential email address    collisions, and conduct a case study on the account policies of U.S.    universities. Finally, we propose several useful practices for    end-users, service providers, and identity providers to protect against    this identity-account inconsistency threat.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Proceedings Paper,English,"Liu, GN (Corresponding Author), Univ Delaware, Newark, DE 19716 USA.

Besides, the term security is not    strictly well defined in view of the fact that there is usually a time    delay between the alarm system going on and actual arrival of the    security personnel. This paper presents the development of a home    security and monitoring system that is suitable where the traditional    security systems that are mostly concerned about curbing burglary,    gathering evidence against trespassing and so on fail. The design and    implementation details of this new home control and security system    which is based on field programmable gate array has been discussed in    the subject paper. The user here can interact directly with the system    through a web-based interface over the Internet, while home appliances    like air conditioners, lights, door locks, and gates are controlled    remotely through a user-friendly web page. An additional feature that    enhances the security aspect of the system is its capability to monitor    entry points such as doors and windows so that in the event of any    breach, an alerting email message could be sent to the home owner    instantly.",TAYLOR \& FRANCIS LTD,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Assaf, MH (Corresponding Author), USP, Fac Sci \& Technol, Dept Elect \& Elect Engn, Suva 19128, Fiji.

Also, IT consumerisation fuelled the adoption of BYOD. Employers    allowing their employees to use their personally owned mobile devices is    claimed to increase institutions production, reduce cost of IT device    maintenance as well as reduced cost of buying IT devices. Even though,    the list of BYOD benefits to both the employer and the employees are    countless, BYOD has been seen by researchers and organizations that have    adopted it as the risky program to the organisations' information    security. Data loss, device and application management, mobile device    loss and malicious application installation constitute the dominating    BYOD risks globally. Like all technology enabled nations, many companies    in Lesotho allow their employees to use their personally owned mobile    devices to perform work related activities such as email access, company    network access, storage of company sensitive information and many    others, this trend is known as Bring Your Own Device (BYOD). However, to    ascertain their risk in relation to known challenges, an explorative    qualitative study using a case study strategy was conducted with the    main objective of assessing the information security risks presented by    BYOD adoption to organizations in Lesotho. Open ended questions were    developed and administered through face to face interviews and an online    semi-structured interview using Survey Monkey. Interviews with 9    employees from X were conducted and questionnaires were shared with 25    IT employees of 5 different companies in Lesotho where 15 from 25 people    responded to the online questions. The results obtained from the study    illustrate where Lesotho as a country lies in relation to information    security and adoption of BYOD in business operations. Risks identified    include loss of confidential information, malware, mobile device loss,    mingling of information and lack of BYOD policy. Based on the revealed    landscape, BYOD information security risks and mitigations are    discussed, and recommendations are presented on the best strategy that    the organisations can adopt to handle BYOD information security risks    within their boundaries.",ACAD  CONFERENCES LTD,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",Proceedings Paper,English,"Morolong, MP (Corresponding Author), Namibia Univ Sci \& Technol, Windhoek, Namibia.

Emerging decentralized clinical trials (DCTs) leveraging digital    health technologies (DHTs) for remote recruitment and data collection    aim to address barriers to participation in traditional trials. The    ACTIV-6 trial is a DCT using DHTs, but participants' experiences of such    trials remain largely unknown. This study explored participants'    perspectives of the ACTIV-6 DCT that tested outpatient COVID-19    therapeutics.Methods: Participants in the ACTIV-6 study were recruited    via email to share their day-to-day trial experiences during 1-hour    virtual focus groups. Two human factors researchers guided group    discussions through a semi-structured script that probed expectations    and perceptions of study activities. Qualitative data analysis was    conducted using a grounded theory approach with open coding to identify    key themes.Results: Twenty-eight ACTIV-6 study participants aged 30+    years completed a virtual focus group including 1-4 participants each.    Analysis yielded three major themes: perceptions of the DCT experience,    study activity engagement, and trust. Participants perceived the use of    remote DCT procedures supported by DHTs as an acceptable and efficient    method of organizing and tracking study activities, communicating with    study personnel, and managing study medications at home. Use of social    media was effective in supporting geographically dispersed participant    recruitment but also raised issues with trust and study    legitimacy.Conclusions: While participants in this qualitative study    viewed the DCT-with-DHT approach as reasonably efficient and engaging,    they also identified challenges to address.

IEEE,Understanding User Tradeoffs for Search in Encrypted Communication,,2018,,,258-272,,"End-to-end message encryption is the only way to achieve absolute    message privacy. However, searching over end-to-end encrypted messages    is complicated. Several popular instant messaging tools (e.g., WhatsApp,    iMessage) circumvent this inconvenience by storing the search index    locally on the devices. Another approach, called searchable encryption,    allows users to search encrypted messages without storing the search    index locally. These approaches have inherent tradeoffs between    usability and security properties, yet little is known about how general    users value these tradeoffs, especially in the context of email rather    than instant messaging. In this paper, we systematize these tradeoffs in    order to identify key feature differences. We use these differences as    the basis for a choice-based conjoint analysis experiment focused on    email (n=160), in which participants make a series of choices between    email services with competing features. The results allow us to quantify    the relative importance of each feature. We find that users indicate    high relative importance for increasing privacy and minimizing local    storage requirements. While privacy is more important overall, local    storage is more important than adding additional marginal privacy after    an initial improvement. These results suggest that local indexing, which    provides more privacy, may often be appropriate for encrypted email, but    that searchable encryption, which limits local storage, may also hold    promise for some users.",IEEE COMPUTER SOC,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Bai, W (Corresponding Author), Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.

IEEE,Mining Spam Accounts with User Influence,,2014,,,167-173,,"As the increasing development of online social networks (OSNs),    spammers' attentions have been attracted from the traditional email    field. Nowadays, advertisements, deception messages, illegal contents    are prevalent in all kinds of ONSs. They're propagated from one to    another arbitrarily, polluting the Internet environment, and what's    more, resulting in a great many of security problems. Some previous    works have been proposed to detect spammers according to user    properties. The problem is that in order to prevent from being detected,    spammers are likely to pretend to be normal, and what's more, some    normal users also engage into spam spreading for financial benefits,    making detection more difficult. In this paper, we solve the detection    problem from the view of user influence. The basic of our work is that    since spammers pretend to be normal, their influences should keep step    with their normal behaviors. But when a spam campaign is launched,    usually in order to influent others, a great many of spammers engaged    into propagation, the original poster's influence would get a sudden    increase, making him outstanding from the others. In this way, we can    distinguish the original spammers and supervise from the root of the    propagation tree.

ACM,SoK: Why Johnny Can't Fix PGP Standardization,,2020,,A34,,,"Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) has long been the primary IETF standard for    encrypting email, but suffers from widespread usability and security    problems that have limited its adoption. As time has marched on, the    underlying cryptographic protocol has fallen out of date insofar as PGP    is unauthenticated on a per message basis and compresses before    encryption. There have been an increasing number of attacks on the    increasingly outdated primitives and complex clients used by the PGP    eco-system. However, attempts to update the OpenPGP standard have failed    at the IETF except for adding modern cryptographic primitives. Outside    of official standardization, Autocrypt is a ``bottom-up{''} community    attempt to fix PGP, but still falls victim to attacks on PGP involving    authentication. The core reason for the inability to ``fix{''} PGP is    the lack of a simple AEAD interface which in turn requires a    decentralized public key infrastructure to work with email. Yet even if    standards like MLS replace PGP, the deployment of a decentralized PKI    remains an open issue.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Proceedings Paper,English,"Halpin, H (Corresponding Author), INRIA, Paris, France.

To counteract these    scammers, volunteers called scam-baiters play the roles of victims,    reply to scammers, and try to waste their time and attention with long    and unproductive conversations. To curb email fraud and magnify the    effectiveness of scam-baiting, we developed and deployed an expandable    scam-baiting mailserver that can conduct scam-baiting activities    automatically. We implemented three reply strategies using three    different models and conducted a one-month-long experiment during which    we elicited 150 messages from 130 different scammers. We compare the    performance of each strategy at attracting and holding the attention of    scammers, finding tradeoffs between human-written and    automatically-generated response strategies. We also demonstrate that    scammers can be engaged concurrently by multiple servers deploying these    strategies in a second experiment, which used two server instances to    contact 92 different scammers over 12 days.

Internet Soc,Gyrus: A Framework for User-Intent Monitoring of Text-Based Networked    Applications,,2014,,,,,"Traditional security systems have largely focused on attack detection.    Unfortunately, accurately identifying the latest attack has proven to be    a never-ending cycle. In this paper, we propose a way to break this    cycle by ensuring that a system's behavior matches the user's intent.    Since our approach is attack agnostic, it will scale better than    traditional security systems.    There are two key components to our approach. First, we capture the    user's intent through their interactions with an application. Second, we    verify that the resulting system output can be mapped back to the user's    interactions. To demonstrate how this works we created Gyrus, a research    prototype that observes user interactions for common tasks such as    sending email, instant messaging, online social networking, and online    financial services. Gyrus secures these applications from malicious    behavior such as spam and wire fraud by allowing only outgoing traffic    with content that matches the user's intent. To understand how Gyrus    captures user intent, consider the case of a text-based application. In    this case the user's input is displayed on the screen so the user can    confirm that their input is correct. Gyrus builds on this concept by    focusing on what is being displayed to the user instead of what the user    has typed or clicked. We call this the ``what you see is what you send    (WYSIWYS){''} policy. We implemented Gyrus under a standard    virtualization environment, and our prototype system successfully stops    malware from sending unintended content over the network. Our evaluation    shows that Gyrus is very efficient and introduces no noticeable delay to    a users' interaction with the protected applications.",INTERNET SOC,"1775 WIEHLE AVE, STE 201, RESTON, VA, UNITED STATES",Proceedings Paper,English,"Jang, Y (Corresponding Author), Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.

"Kwok, Thomas and Nguyen, Thao and Lam, Linh and Chieu, Trieu",A Web-based and email driven electronic contract management system,,2007,,,149-156,,"In an enterprise, managing and processing an electronic contract often    involves a number of contract administrators and representatives in the    enterprise, and their counter parts in their suppliers, business    partners or their customers to carry out a large number of complex    manual tasks in sequences during the life cycle of electronic contract.    In most commercially available electronic contract management systems,    users either waste a lot of their time in monitoring their task lists    for their turns to act on their electronic contracts or most electronic    contracts simply stay idle for most of the time if users only check    their task lists once a while. In addition, these manual tasks are often    tedious and may cause security faults.    In this paper, we present a Web-based and email driven electronic    contract management system that supports both internal and    intra-enterprises workflows, and with multi-tenants hosting capability.    This system enables a user to act on the next task in a sequence of    tasks to process a particular electronic contract immediately after the    other user has completed the previous task in the same sequence of tasks    by sending out email notifications to alert or remind the user to take    action on the task. We also describe several novel methods to automate    some manual and tedious tasks, such as watermarking signature    information on the signed electronic contract and life cycle management,    in this paper. Most users have found their productivities improved, the!    electronic contract transaction time accelerated, contractual errors    reduced and many other benefits by using this electronic contract    management system in several IBM pilot programs.",IEEE COMPUTER SOC,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Kwok, Thomas; Nguyen, Thao; Lam, Linh; Chieu, Trieu, Thomas J Watson Res Ctr, IBM Res Div, Hawthorne, NY 10532 USA.",10.1109/ICEBE.2007.23,,,,Business \& Economics; Computer Science; Engineering; Information    Science \& Library Science,"Business; Computer Science, Hardware \& Architecture; Computer Science,    Information Systems; Computer Science, Software Engineering; Computer    Science, Theory \& Methods; Engineering, Electrical \& Electronic;    Information Science \& Library Science; Management",inproceedings,WOS:000252481800018,"Cheung, SC and Li, YS and Chao, KM and Younas, M and Chung, JY","ICEBE 2007: IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON E-BUSINESS ENGINEERING,    PROCEEDINGS",International Conference on e-Business Engineering,"IEEE International Conference on e-Business Engineering, Hong Kong,    PEOPLES R CHINA, OCT 24-26, 2007",978-0-7695-3003-1,,IEEE Comp Soc TCEC; Univ Hong Kong; Hong Kong Univ Sci \& Technol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IEEE,A Novel Visual-Privacy Themed Experiential-Learning Tool for    Human-Privacy \& Societal-Security Awareness in Middle-School and    High-School Youth,,2019,,,,,"This Full-paper in the Innovative-Practice Category introduces an    innovative visual-privacy themed experiential-learning tool, and    discusses how it is used for building human-privacy plus    societal-security awareness in middle-school and high-school youth. The    new GDPR driven business-communications are touching the lives of    worldwide-consumers, including youth, who use technology-services, like    Internet and email, from an early age. A lack of privacy-security    awareness in this context may expose youth. The new CSTA-standards    advocate for inclusion of privacy, safety, ethics, societal-security and    human-privacy topics in K-12. Existing literature show multiple    instances of K-12 research-studies on data-privacy education and    cybersecurity awareness. However, very few of these explore the    visual-privacy theme in a way that middle-school and high-school youth    can learn privacy, security and ethics through the lens of    privacy-enhancing videosurveillance. This paper presents our simple but    novel, visually interactive experiential-learning tool, which is based    upon the PA theme as applicable to visual-media contents. Our unique    tool introduces young learners to privacy-security concepts, illustrates    applied-cryptography and discusses privacy-security tradeoffs in    surveillance-space. The educational application of this tool addresses    the gap within the current K-12 educational-research work in    societal-security implications and human-privacy domain. We discuss our    experimental-studies with this tool, including piloting the tool-based    hands-on workshop sessions with middle-school and high-school learners,    as part of GICS and NSA-GenCyber projects. Additionally, we share and    analyze the learning-assessment data and survey-responses collected from    participants, in an effort to evaluate the prospects of our    experiential-learning model as a potential educational and outreach    medium for engaging and recruiting K-12 students in    computing-disciplines.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Chattopadhyay, A (Corresponding Author), Univ Wisconsin, Comp Sci Program, Green Bay, WI 54302 USA.

IEEE,Design and Implementation of an Automated Security System using Twilio    Messaging Service,,2017,,,59-63,,"Security has become a major concern these days especially with the    burgeoning rate of thefts and crimes. Studies show that homes without    security systems are more likely to be targeted by burglars than those    with professionally monitored systems. Security systems are often the    first line of defense against break-ins. Today, due to the advancements    in technology and in the Internet of Things (IoT), it is possible to    envision pervasive connectivity, storage and automation in systems. This    paper focuses on designing and developing a model of an IoT-Based    security system for homes, banks and offices in need of security. The    proposed system has provision for theft and fire detection and sends    alerts to the user through a text message. It also captures a number of    snapshots of the intruder and mails it to the user. When compared to the    other existing systems, the leverage obtained by preferring this system    is that the user receives alerts irrespective of his location and    whether or not he is connected to the internet or not. This system also    consumes less power as the camera is activated and takes snapshots only    in the presence of an intruder, unlike the CCTV system, where live feed    is recorded round the clock This system not only notifies the user but    also the neighbor so that immediate action could be taken.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Venkatesan, S (Corresponding Author), SSN Coll Engn, Dept Elect \& Commun Engn, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India.

USENIX,A Mixed-Methods Study on User Experiences and Challenges of Recovery    Codes for an End-to-End Encrypted Service,,2024,,BX8MS,7267-7284,,"Recovery codes are a popular backup mechanism for online services to aid    users who lost their passwords or two-factor authentication tokens in    regaining access to their accounts or encrypted data. Especially for    end-to-end encrypted services, recovery codes are a critical feature, as    the service itself cannot access the encrypted user data and help users    regain access. The way end-users manage recovery codes is not well    understood. Hence, we investigate end-user perceptions and management    strategies of recovery codes. Therefore, we survey users of an    end-to-end encrypted email service provider, deploying recovery codes    for accounts and encrypted data recovery in case of authentication    credential loss. We performed an online survey with 281 users. In a    second study, we analyzed 196 support requests on Reddit. Most of our    participants stored the service provider's recovery code. We could    identify six strategies for saving it, with using a password manager    being the most widespread. Participants were generally satisfied with    the service provider's recovery code. However, while they appreciated    its security, its usability was lacking. We found obstacles, such as    losing access to the recovery code or non-functioning recovery codes and    security misconceptions. These often resulted from users not    understanding the underlying security implications, e.g., that the    support cannot access or restore their unencrypted data.",USENIX ASSOC,"SUITE 215, 2560 NINTH ST, BERKELEY, CA 94710 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Höltervennhoff, S (Corresponding Author), Leibniz Univ Hannover, Hannover, Germany.

It is useful to have information about where    a device/user was at the time the offending activity was performed. It    would be desirable to correlate different pieces of evidence to discover    information, such as IP addresses used by the same device, physical    address and location of the device, connection time of the device,    browsing habits and mail access transactions carried out by the user    using the device. Log data from various sources are required to be    correlated together to create contexts of information, which is not    visible from one source alone. In large networks, users/devices    accessing a private network repeatedly can be tracked by analyzing and    correlating DHCP, Network Access Control, WWW, Email server logs. With    huge amount of logs, the common approach of manual browsing, correlating    of log events, based on timelines is tedious, unresponsive approach.

Social    engineering attacks, ransom-ware applications and harmful spam email    messages are data breach catalysts that are the result of human error.    Human error is the leading cause of data breach and is also one of the    more difficult factors for an organization to mitigate. Many users are    unable to see how their role is impacted by organizational security    policy, and therefor see no benefit to abide the policy. When employees    use company devices to perform personal tasks, or use personal devices    to perform business tasks, lines of ownership can be blurred and    important organizational data assets can be put at risk. Training and    awareness programs are too often treated as a bandage to fix a wound    inflicted by a breach after the fact. If employees were trained    effectively, the breach might not have occurred in the first place. This    project and accompanying research paper will explore the gamification of    the security training and awareness program.

"Chiku, Sohto and Hara, Keisuke and Shikata, Junji",Chosen Ciphertext Security for Blind Identity-Based Encryption with    Certified Identities,,2023,14341,,299-314,,"Identity-based encryption (IBE) is one of the important extension of    public-key encryption (PKE) which can use identities, such as email    addresses or phone numbers, as public keys. Due to this aspect, IBE can    reduce the cost of maintaining public key infrastructure. However, it    has a special issue called the `' key escrow problem `', which means    that the key generation center (KGC) can decrypt all ciphertexts and get    all messages in them since it inherently has all user public/private key    pairs. To tackle this problem, Emura, Katsumata, and Watanabe recently    proposed a variant of IBE called blind IBE with certified identities by    introducing identity certifying authority (ICA). Their constructions are    based on pairing or lattice and secure against chosen plaintext attacks.    In this paper, we introduce security against chosen ciphertext attacks    (CCA security) for blind identity-based Encryption with certified    identities. More precisely, we formalize definitions of 3-types security    against chosen ciphertext attacks (security against corrupted users,    KGC, and ICA) for blind IBE with certified identities. Then, we propose    the first blind IBE with certified identities schemes. Roughly, we    provide a generic construction by applying the FujisakiOkamoto    transformation to previous CPA secure Blind IBE with certified    identities schemes. Through our generic construction, we obtain two    instantiations based on pairing or lattice. Finally, we implement our    pairing based scheme and demonstrate that it is practically efficient    compared with existing schemes.",SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,"152 BEACH ROAD, \#21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",Proceedings Paper,English,"Chiku, S (Corresponding Author), Yokohama Natl Univ, Yokohama, Japan.

Storage of data is done in    devices such as USB, external hard disk, laptops, I-Pad or at cloud.    Cloud computing presents with both ups and downs. However, storing    information elsewhere increases risk of being attacked by hackers.    Besides, the risk of losing the device or being stolen is increased in    case of storage in portable devices. There are array of mediums of    communications and even emails used to send data or information but    these technologies come along with severe weaknesses such as absence of    confidentiality where the message sent can be altered and sent to the    recipient. No proofs are shown to the recipient that the message    received is altered. The recipient would not find out unless he or she    checks with the sender. Without encrypted of data or message, sniffing    tools and software can be used to hack and read the information since it    is in plaintext. Therefore, an electronic mail authentication is    proposed, namely Hybrid Encryption System (HES). The security of HES is    protected using asymmetric and symmetric key algorithms. The asymmetric    algorithm is RSA and symmetric algorithm is Advance Encryption Standard.    With the combination for both algorithms in the HES may provide the    confidentiality and authenticity to the electronic documents send from    the sender to the recipient. In a nutshell, the HES will help users to    protect their valuable documentation and data from illegal third party    user.",AMER INST PHYSICS,"2 HUNTINGTON QUADRANGLE, STE 1NO1, MELVILLE, NY 11747-4501 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Halim, MAA (Corresponding Author), Univ Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Fak Sains Komputer \& Teknol Maklumat, Soft Comp \& Multimedia Ctr, Johor Baharu, Malaysia.

Cryptography combined with    steganography is considered as a good measure of privacy protection    scheme. However conventionally, steganography deals with the hiding of    text or audio or image data within one another. For multimedia data like    image and videos, images are considered to be good carriers. However use    of image as carrier for hiding plain text data increases the storage    requirement and transmission bandwidth by multi-fold. Therefore in this    paper we propose an Unique Data Security using Text Steganography    (UDSTS) to build a system that is able to transmit and receive encrypted    messages embedded in rich text Format: {*}.DOC, {*}.RTF, EMAIL /Message    Body/, etc. The user can choose the fake text and the program tells    whether this fake text will suit the real text. The user is enabled to    set different password for every message he sends and therefore two    different messages can be transmitted to two groups with two different    passwords using the same fake text.    Text messages are considered to be harmless and do not trigger a    scrutiny. Hence the technique provides a very good data protection    scheme. We also demonstrate that the technique can be adopted to hide    text message behind different types of files including source codes like    c++, c\# code.

IEEE,Fault Tree Analysis of Accidental Insider Security Events,,2012,,,113-118,,Insider threats have been categorized as unintentional and malicious.    The frameworks and models which are used to detect malicious behavior of    employees would likely fail to detect unintentional insider as there is    no malicious intent. This paper accentuates the limitation of MERIT    (Management and Education of Risks of Insider Threat) in its scope for    accidental insider threats and proposes Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) of the    security events caused by accidental insiders. We perform FTA on two    cases involving accidental insiders which help understand human side    behind the user errors. The first case involves data loss via outbound    email due to employee error while the second case involves accidental    disclosure of sensitive information by insiders. The countermeasures are    thus better interpreted and communicated as the causes of a threat are    well understood which is essential for human fault avoidance.,IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Patil, P (Corresponding Author), Concordia Univ, Coll Alberta, Informat Syst Secur, 7128 Ada Blvd, Edmonton, AB T5B 4E4, Canada.

IEEE,Making Sense of Large Volumes of Unstructured Email Responses,,2016,,,35-40,,"Unstructured textual data has increased to unprecedented levels with the    rapid spread of user generated content via social media. Handling large    volumes of unstructured text data is a challenging task that is    increasingly becoming needed in a variety of situations. Reading and    extracting important information from large collections of text manually    is impractical and often impossible. This research concerns making sense    of 500,000 email submissions received in response to a debate on Net    Neutrality in India. The large volume of HTML format data was    preprocessed using natural language processing (NLP) before analyzing    it. Topic modeling and sentiment analysis were used to explore the    nature and scope of the submissions so received, and provided a    framework for dealing with this increasingly recurring problem.    Interesting topics were identified from the submissions by using the    Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model, which included themes    such as the speed of internet, security, privacy and internet traffic    among others. Word clouds were then generated to visualize key concepts    within these email responses. A lexicon-based approach was used to    classify the sentiment polarity of responses as positive, negative and    neutral. Two methods were used to classify polarity of responses. In the    first method, negative and positive word lists were used to classify    polarity. There was considerable accuracy in the classification results.    In the second method, the SentiWordNet lexical resource was used for    classification and resulted in improved performance.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Jayathilaka, KMPN (Corresponding Author), Univ Colombo, Dept Stat, Colombo 03, Sri Lanka.

IEEE,Two-Pronged Phish Snagging,,2012,,,174-179,,"Phishing causes billions of dollars in damage every year and poses a    serious threat to the Internet economy. Among the many possible    communication channels, electronic mail still remains the most commonly    used medium to launch phishing attacks. In this paper, we present a two    dimensional approach to detecting phishing emails. We devise two    independent, unsupervised classifiers, namely the link and header    classifiers, and two combinations of these classifiers. We show that or    schemes significantly outperform the previous unsupervised and    supervised phishing detection schemes for emails in the literature. We    also utilize contextual information, when available, to detect phishing.    Finally, our protocol is designed to detect phishing at the email level    rather than detecting fraudulent, masqueraded websites. Our    implementation framework called PhishSnag, operates between a user's    mail transfer agent (MTA) and mail user agent (MUA) and processes each    arriving email for phishing attacks even before reaching the inbox.",IEEE COMPUTER SOC,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Verma, R (Corresponding Author), Univ Houston, Dept Comp Sci, Houston, TX 77004 USA.

Not only are we able to identify    individual computer users by their behavioral patterns, we are also able    to detect significant deviations in their typical computer usage over    time, or compared to a group of their peers. For instance, most people    have a small, and relatively unique selection of regularly visited    websites, certain email services, daily work hours, and typical    preferred applications for mandated tasks. We argue that these habitual    patterns are sufficiently specific to identify fully anonymized network    users.    We demonstrate that with only a modest data collection capability,    profiles of individual computer users can be constructed so as to    uniquely identify a profiled user from among their peers. As time    progresses and habits or circumstances change, the methods presented    update each profile so that changes in user behavior can be reliably    detected over both abrupt and gradual time frames, without losing the    ability to identify the profiled user.    The primary benefit of our methodology allows one to efficiently detect    deviant behaviors, such as subverted user accounts, or organizational    policy violations. Thanks to the relative robustness, these techniques    can be used in scenarios with very diverse data collection capabilities,    and data privacy requirements. In addition to behavioral change    detection, the generated profiles can also be compared against    pre-defined examples of known adversarial patterns.",SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING,"1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Murphy, JP (Corresponding Author), Dartmouth Coll, Thayer Sch Engn, Hanover, NH 03755 USA.

Increasing availability of    affordable cell phone technologies may provide an opportunity for    research follow-up among construction workers once they leave the    worksite. Using pilot study survey data we characterize and examine the    association of cell phone technology ownership and cellular text/email    services among a non-probabilistic sample of payroll and temporary    construction workers.    Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used to administer a    one-time paper-based anonymous survey to construction workers working at    construction sites in Florida, USA. The survey featured questions on    sociodemographic characteristics, occupational history, cell phone    technology ownership, and cellular text/email services capabilities.    Results: Among the 223 construction worker survey respondents, 31.4\%    identified as temporary workers and 68.6\% were on payroll and 87.4\%    owned a cell phone. Construction workers who own a cell phone had    greater than a high school education (28.9\% vs. 25.0\%; p = 0.019),    made >\$30,000/year (27.1\% vs. 14.8\%; p = 0.011), had same cell phone    number for >1 year (74.4\% vs. 40.7\%; p = 0.001), and were employed as    a payroll worker (71.0\% vs. 50.0\%; p = 0.037). Temporary construction    workers compared to their payroll counterparts were significantly less    likely to have email services on their cell phone {[}unadjusted-odds    ratio 0.41 (95\% CI: 0.17-0.97)].

However, there are some downsides to it such as the user    forgetting their password or the account being hacked by an attacker. To    retrieve their password, websites are asking for an alternate email    address or security question. Due to its expanding features and    popularity, social media has become more vulnerable. It is no secret    that social media providers leave security to the discretion of users    during the development, which raises serious concerns. Earlier research    has been supported by the Protective Motivation Theory (PMT), which    provides a hypothetical structure for analyzing the protection of    Internet users. According to the current internet safety search, new    engines incorporated into a PMT structure for perhaps the first time.    Adaptation assessment variables, including the strength of behavior, the    effectiveness of responses, and individual responsibility, were the most    important predictors of online safety intentions. A multi-factor    authentication mechanism linked to a trust model used on SNS. The needs,    actions, and behaviors of users are particularly adaptable to confidence    systems. The level of threat was also a significant predictor. The    explanatory power of the standard PMT model with the multi-factor    authentication technique was raised by 15\% by incorporating new    components such as past experiences, behavioral control, habitual    strength, security and safety support, and individual responsibility.    The results are considered in the advanced evolution of PMT in the    context of Internet security for home computer users.

ACM,"I Like It, but I Hate It: Employee Perceptions Towards an Institutional    Transition to BYOD Second-Factor Authentication",,2017,,,212-224,,"The continued acceptance of enhanced security technologies in the    private sector, such as two-factor authentication, has prompted    significant changes of organizational security practices. While past    work has focused on understanding how users in consumer settings react    to enhanced security measures for banking, email, and more, little work    has been done to explore how these technological transitions and    applications occur within organizational settings. Moreover, while many    corporations have invested significantly to secure their networks for    the sake of protecting valuable intellectual property, academic    institutions, which also create troves of intellectual property, have    fallen behind in this endeavor.    In this paper, we detail a transition from a token-based, two-factor    authentication system within an academic institution to an entirely    digital system utilizing employee-owned mobile devices. To accomplish    this, we first conducted discussions with staff from the Information    Security Office to understand the administrative perspective of the    transition. Second, our key contribution is the analysis of an in-depth    survey to explore the perceived benefits and usability of the novel    technological requirements from the employee perspective. In particular,    we investigate the implications of the new authentication system based    on employee acceptance or opposition to the mandated technological    transition, with a specific focus on the utilization of personal devices    for workplace authentication.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Weidman, J (Corresponding Author), Penn State Univ, 201 Old Main, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.

As construction    accidents may cause project delays, safety management plays an important    role in a project's timely completion. This study aims to undertake a    comparative study of HR practices adopted for safety management on    construction projects in the United States (US) and Singapore and to    investigate the relationship between HR practices and construction    safety management outcomes (severity and frequency of accidents). The    research method included exploratory interviews and industry surveys of    contractors in the US and Singapore by email and post. Data were    collected using structured questionnaires. Compared to Singapore    contractors, the results show that US contractors' project management    practices place significantly more emphasis on highlighting    organizational safety values to new workers and taking working    experience into account during the selection process. On the other hand,    Singapore contractors place more emphasis on providing appropriate rest    areas for workers. Many HR practices are significantly correlated with    safety management outcomes. These include: taking age into consideration    during selection process and giving feedback to workers about their    unsafe behaviour. It is recommended that project managers adopt relevant    HR practices that lead to more effective safety management on    construction projects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. and IPMA.

This study investigated whether this interaction is present in the realm    of email phishing. Additionally, a signal detection theory framework was    used to evaluate how the various persuasion principles influence    accuracy, sensitivity (d'), and response criterion placement. A    personality inventory and an email identification task (phishing or    legitimate) were used. These data support previous findings that high    extroversion is predictive of increased susceptibility to phishing    attacks.

IoT is    one of the fastest developing fields in the history of computing, with    an estimated 50 billion devices by the end of 2020. However, the    crosscutting nature of IoT systems and the multidisciplinary components    involved in the deployment of such systems have introduced new security    challenges. Implementing security measures, such as encryption,    authentication, access control, network and application security for IoT    devices and their inherent vulnerabilities is ineffective. Therefore,    existing security methods should be enhanced to effectively secure the    IoT ecosystem. Machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) have advanced    considerably over the last few years, and machine intelligence has    transitioned from laboratory novelty to practical machinery in several    important applications. Consequently, ML/DL methods are important in    transforming the security of IoT systems from merely facilitating secure    communication between devices to security-based intelligence systems.    The goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive survey of ML methods    and recent advances in DL methods that can be used to develop enhanced    security methods for IoT systems. IoT security threats that are related    to inherent or newly introduced threats are presented, and various    potential IoT system attack surfaces and the possible threats related to    each surface are discussed. We then thoroughly review ML/DL methods for    IoT security and present the opportunities, advantages and shortcomings    of each method.

Multiple studies have shown that human    factors influence the success of phishing attempts. However, these    studies were conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic, which is    significant because security reports show that the numbers of phishing    attacks have been rapidly increasing since the start of COVID-19. This    study investigates the extent to which users' fear, anxiety and stress    levels regarding COVID-19, impact falling for common and COVID-19 themed    phishing scams during the outbreak period. Prior studies have depicted    the effects of human behaviour on phishing attacks before the pandemic,    such as risk-taking preferences and users' demographic factors, hence    this study also focuses on the effects of those factors on the    likelihood of phishing victimisation. More concretely, we present the    results of a scenario-based roleplay experiment to study the    relationship between fear, anxiety, stress, risk-taking, and demographic    factors and the success of phishing attacks during the pandemic. The    findings indicate that fear of COVID-19 influences the success of    COVID-19 specific themed phishing scams, while anxiety, stress, and    risk-taking influences the success of both the COVID-19 themed and    common phishing scams.

In this respect, the    question of how an organizational user can differentiate between a    genuine communication and a similar looking fraudulent communication in    an email/APT threat vector remains a dilemma. Therefore, identifying and    evaluating the APT vector attributes and assigning relative weights to    them can assist the user to make a correct decision when confronted with    a scenario that may be genuine or a malicious APT vector.

A previous systematic review found no    articles describing PSE in dentistry. This article aimed to review the    evidence base for, and the current practice of, PSE in UK dental    schools.MethodsLiterature search and surveys were sent via email to all    16 UK dental schools.ResultsSix articles describing PSE interventions    were found: 2 small-scale studies for dental students and 4    interprofessional studies. Patient safety education is effective for    undergraduate dental students with significant improvement in knowledge    and interest. Interprofessional studies reported improved teamwork    skills and more positive attitudes toward interprofessional working.The    2018 and 2021 surveys had response rates of 56\% and 100\%,    respectively. An increase in integrated formal PSE and assessment in UK    dental schools is demonstrated. No barriers to implementation were    reported. Forty-six percent of schools deliver interprofessional PSE,    38\% deliver human factors, 81\% teach communication, 94\% teach    professionalism, and 31\% of schools have a patient safety (PS)    champion.ConclusionsLimited published literature on PSE in dentistry is    available. However, the lack of published articles does not mean that PS    is not being taught, as many UK dental schools were found to have formal    PSE integrated and assessed within their curriculum. Further development    is needed in terms of appointing PS champions for leadership and human    factors training.

"Jiang, Frank and Tang, Mingdong and Quang Anh Tran",User Preference-Based Spamming Detection with Coupled Behavioral    Analysis,,2016,10066,,466-477,,"Nowadays, the explosive growth of unsolicited emails on Internet has    been challenging the spam filtering systems when at the presence of big    data. Current spam filters suffer from the following problems: (1) Not    personalised; (2) Comparatively static association rules defined in the    firewalls, or gateways; (3) Cannot identify the extremely hidden    information that mixed in the syntax or semantics. To overcome these    problems, we develop and implement a new email spamming system leveraged    by coupled text similarity analysis on user preference and a virtual    meta-layer user-based email network, we take the social networks or    campus LANs as the spam social network scenario. Fewer current practices    exploit social networking initiatives to assist in spam filtering.    Social network has essentially a large number of accounts features to be    considered.    We construct a new model called meta-layer email network which can    reduce these features by only considering individual user's actions    i.e., replying network, reading network and deleting network. For the    first time, these common user actions are considered to construct a    social behavior-based email network. Further, a coupled selection model    is developed for this email network, we are able to consider all    relevant factors/features in a whole and recommend the emails    practically to the user individually. The experiment data comes from the    Enron email dataset, which has been recognized as a representative    dataset for testing and validation. The experimental results show the    new approach can achieve higher precision and accuracy with better email    ranking in favor of personalised preference.",SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",Proceedings Paper,English,"Tang, MD (Corresponding Author), Hunan Univ Sci \& Technol, Sch Comp Sci, Xiangtan 411201, Hunan, Peoples R China.

Successful training efforts focused on child behavior, including    individualized streetside training and training in large virtual    pedestrian environments, are laborious and expensive. This study    considers the usability and feasibility of a virtual pedestrian    environment ``game{''} application to teach children safe    street-crossing behavior via the internet, a medium that could be    broadly disseminated at low cost. Ten 7- and 8-year-old children    participated. They engaged in an internet-based virtual pedestrian    environment and completed a brief assessment survey. Researchers rated    children's behavior while engaged in the game. Both self-report and    researcher observations indicated the internet-based system was readily    used by the children without adult support. The youth understood how to    engage in the system and used it independently and attentively. The    program also was feasible. It provided multiple measures of pedestrian    safety that could be used for research or training purposes. Finally,    the program was rated by children as engaging and educational.    Researcher ratings suggested children used the program with minimal    fidgeting or boredom. The pilot test suggests an internet-based virtual    pedestrian environment offers a usable, feasible, engaging, and    educational environment for child pedestrian safety training. If future    research finds children learn the cognitive and perceptual skills needed    to cross streets safely within it, internet-based training may provide a    low-cost medium to broadly disseminate child pedestrian safety training.

Therefore, it deserves the same    level of security as the user authentication process. A common    simplistic procedure for account recovery requires that a user enters    the same email used during registration, to which a password recovery    link or a new username could be sent. Therefore, an impostor with access    to a user's registration email and other credentials can trigger an    account recovery session to take over the user's account. To prevent    such attacks, beyond validating the email and other credentials entered    by the user, our proposed recovery method utilizes keystroke dynamics to    further secure the account recovery mechanism. Keystroke dynamics is a    type of behavioral biometrics that uses the analysis of typing rhythm    for user authentication. Using a new dataset with over 500,000    keystrokes collected from 44 students and university staff when they    fill out an account recovery web form of multiple fields, we have    evaluated the performance of five scoring algorithms on individual    fields as well as feature-level fusion and weighted-score fusion. We    achieve the best EER of 5.47\% when keystroke dynamics from individual    fields are used, 0\% for a feature-level fusion of five fields, and 0\%    for a weighted-score fusion of seven fields.

Of particular    interest among them is forward security, which makes past messages    remain secure in the event that the secret key gets exposed. Traditional    forward-secure public key encryption can provide forward security for    asynchronous scenarios, but it is not flexible enough for instant    messaging systems. This is mainly because that, after updating his/her    secret key, the user totally loses the decryption capacity of    ciphertexts that have not been received. In this paper, to achieve    practical forward-security of asynchronous messaging systems, we    investigate the construction of a new primitive named forward-secure    puncturable encryption (FSPE) that captures fine-grained forward    security. Namely, the user can maintain the decryption capacity of those    encrypted messages that have not been received yet. Meanwhile, even if    the secret key is disclosed, those received messages can still remain    secure. Specifically, we propose a communication-efficient FSPE scheme    for achieving fine-grained forward-secure asynchronous messaging.    Moreover, to improve the efficiency of asynchronous messaging built upon    FSPE, we extend it to support outsourced decryption. We also implement    the proposed scheme and evaluate a proof-of-concept of main algorithms,    so as to increase confidence on its correctness and practicability.",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Article,English,"Chen, XF (Corresponding Author), Xidian Univ, State Key Lab Integrated Serv Networks ISN, Xian 710071, Peoples R China.

While a great deal of    effort has been devoted to solving the phishing problem by prevention    and detection of phishing emails and phishing Web sites, little research    has been done in the area of training users to recognize those attacks.    Our research focuses on educating users about phishing and helping them    make better trust decisions. We identified a number of challenges for    end-user security education in general and anti-phishing education in    particular: users are not motivated to learn about security; for most    users, security is a secondary task; it is difficult to teach people to    identify security threats without also increasing their tendency to    misjudge nonthreats as threats. Keeping these challenges in mind, we    developed an email-based anti-phishing education system called    ``PhishGuru{''} and an online game called ``Anti-Phishing Phil{''} that    teaches users how to use cues in URLs to avoid falling for phishing    attacks. We applied learning science instructional principles in the    design of PhishGuru and Anti-Phishing Phil. In this article we present    the results of PhishGuru and Anti-Phishing Phil user studies that    demonstrate the effectiveness of these tools. Our results suggest that,    while automated detection systems should be used as the first line of    defense against phishing attacks, user education offers a complementary    approach to help people better recognize fraudulent emails and websites.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA",Article,English,"Kumaraguru, P (Corresponding Author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.

Most of the existing    literature on this subject has focused on the technical aspects related    to phishing. The factors that cause humans to be susceptible to phishing    attacks are still not well-understood. To fill this gap, we reviewed the    available literature and systematically categorized the phishing    susceptibility variables studied. We classify variables based on their    temporal scope, which led us to propose a three-stage Phishing    Susceptibility Model (PSM) for explaining how humans are vulnerable to    phishing attacks. This model reveals several research gaps that need to    be addressed to understand and improve protection against phishing    susceptibility. Our reviewalso systematizes existing studies by their    sample size and generalizability and further suggests a practical impact    assessment of the value of studying variables: Some more easily lead to    improvements than others.

Nowadays, IoTenabled smart devices like smart mobile phones, PDAs, and    tablets are being used by them for such tasks due to rapid growth in    IoT. Smart homes have been widely accepted by individuals and    organizations world wide due to their many advantages. Home security    systems can be defined as monitoring of complete home/some portion of    home from a remotely located or centralized location. It allows the user    to watch all activities inside the home from a remote location that    ultimately gives satisfaction to the owner of the home. Many home    security systems exist, but they have some challenging issues like:    delay, non -web enabled and difficult to handle during transfer of    alerts to user in situation where any unusual event occurred inside the    home. If any unusual event encountered inside the home, where security    systems deployed, then system must be capable enough to send alert to    the user without any delay by phone, text, or email. Cameras and other    latest network technologies have enabled us to remotely monitor the home    more effectively and efficiently from our smart phone. Hence,    considering the above mentioned facts, in this paper, we have proposed    an advanced Internet of Thing based Security Alert System for Smart Home    in order to detect an intruder or any unusual event at home, when nobody    is available there. This low-cost home security system utilizes a small    pyroelectric Infrared (PIR) module and raspberry pi for minimizing the    delay during process of e-mail alert.

Home automation can be defined as accessing or    controlling many of our home appliances, security, climate, and video    monitoring from a remote or centralized location. A home automation    system allows us to check in on our home from a remote location, giving    us true peace of mind. Some systems will let us interact with the home    security system, providing the ability to arm and disarm our home    remotely. Some complete home automation systems will alert us by phone,    text or email if there is any unusual movements within our home. Cheaper    rates of cameras and different accessible network technologies have made    remote home monitoring more effective enabling us to control everything    from our cell phone.

The Domain Name System    (DNS) is the foundation of internet which translates user friendly    domains, named based Resource Records (RR) into corresponding IP    addresses and vice-versa. Nowadays usage of DNS services are not merely    for translating domain names, but it is also used to block spam, email    authentication like DKIM and the latest DMARC, the TXT records found in    DNS are mainly about improving the security of services. So, virtually    almost every internet application is using DNS. If not works properly    then whole internet communication will collapse. Therefore security of    DNS infrastructures is one of the core requirements for any organization    in current cyber security arena. DNS are favorite place for attackers    due to huge loss of its outcome. So breach in DNS security will in    resultant affects the trust worthiness of whole internet. Therefore    security of DNS is paramount, in case DNS infrastructure is vulnerable    and compromised, organizations lose their revenue, they face downtime,    customer dissatisfaction, privacy loss, confront legal challenges and    many more. As we know that DNS is now become the largest distributed    database, but initially at the time of DNS design the only goal was to    provide scalable and available name resolution service but its security    perspectives were not focused and overlooked at that time. So there are    number of security flaws exist and there is an urgent requirement to    provide some additional mechanism for addressing known vulnerabilities.    From these security challenges, most important one is DNS data integrity    and availability. For this purpose we introduced cryptographic framework    that is configured on open source platform by incorporating DNSSEC with    Bind DNS software which addresses integrity and availability issues of    DNS by establishing DNS chain of trust using digitally signed DNS data.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Jalalzai, MH (Corresponding Author), Natl Univ Sci \& Technol, Islamabad, Pakistan.

Many recent cyberattacks on    e-learning systems, educational content services, and trainee management    systems have created severe demands for specialized technological    solutions to protect the security of modern training methods. Email is    one of the most critical technologies of educational organizations that    are attacked daily by spam, phishing campaigns, and all kinds of    malicious programs. Considering the efforts made by the global research    community to ensure educational processes, this study presents an    advanced deep attention collaborative filter for secure academic email    services. It is a specialized application of intelligent techniques    that, for the first time, examines and models the problem of spam as a    system of graphs where collaborative referral systems undertake the    processing and analysis of direct and indirect social information to    detect and categorize spam emails. In this study, nonnegative matrix    factorization (NMF) is applied to the social graph adjacent table to    place users in one (or more) overlapping communities. Also, using a deep    attention mechanism, it becomes personalized for each user. At the same    time, with the introduction of exponential random graph models (ERGMs)    in the process of factorization, local dependencies are significantly    mitigated to achieve the revelation of malicious communities. This    methodology is being tested successfully in implementing mail protection    systems for educational organizations.

Modern organizations deploy an array of sensor and alarm    systems, encompassing keys, facial recognition, and fingerprint    authentication to fortify their security protocols. However, inherent    limitations in these methods render them vulnerable to potential theft.    This research presents a pioneering approach to overcome these    constraints by introducing an advanced smart locker system engineered to    significantly mitigate the risk of theft compared to the existing    systems. The system seamlessly integrates essential components, such as    Arduino, fingerprint sensors, micro-cameras, electronic door locks,    keypads, LCD displays, and node MCU culminating in a robust defense    mechanism. Three intricately designed protection layers harmonize to    form a comprehensive security framework. The first layer, termed the    ``shielding layer,{''} activates the micro-camera and fingerprint sensor    to capture images of unauthorized tampering. These images are    transmitted expeditiously to the email and phone of the administrator    for immediate intervention. Subsequently, the ``identification layer{''}    employs a sophisticated fingerprint sensor to authenticate registered    users, further enhancing security. Finally, ``Internet of Things    layer{''} generates a four-digit OTP dispatched to the mobile device of    the user. Upon entering the correct OTP, users receive a secure link via    email, thereby granting access to the locker. This synergistic    integration of security layers transcends conventional systems, offering    robust protection and intelligence within security paradigms. The    proposed system, tested against several state-of-the-art secure locker    systems, effectively addresses evolving challenges in safeguarding    valuable possessions and documents providing enhanced security.",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Article,English,"Younis, I (Corresponding Author), Nanjing Univ Sci \& Technol, Sch Comp Sci \& Engn, Nanjing 210094, Peoples R China.

It is    essential that all occupants know how to act in an emergency situation,    particularly during an emergency evacuation. In higher education    institutions (HEIs), which annually host not only their many employees,    but also national and international students, it is essential to know    and understand the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors that the academic    community demonstrates in this matter. This study aimed to characterize    the perception of occupants regarding safety, specifically in the    emergency evacuation phase, within the academic community of an HEI. In    this observational cross-sectional study, data on general knowledge and    attitudes regarding safety and actions during emergency situations were    collected through an anonymous questionnaire targeting students,    faculty, and non-teaching staff, which was sent via institutional email.    Valid responses were received from 392 participants and then scored and    assessed on different domains. The results obtained showed that, despite    a reasonable average regarding the general level of knowledge,    attitudes, and behaviors of the occupants on the subject, the community    falls somewhat short in terms of training. It is noteworthy that    approximately 64\% of the sample has never received awareness or    training related to emergency evacuation, and around 68\% are unaware of    the location of their institution's meeting/gathering point. Finally, by    identifying the most common gaps, namely the training dimension, some    simple measures could be improved, such as the dissemination of safety    instructions accessible through QR codes placed in strategic locations    or even conducting small drills during class sessions, as well as    learning with simulation concerning different scenarios of emergency.",MDPI,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Article,English,"Carvalhais, C (Corresponding Author), Polytech Porto, TBIO, ESS, Rua Dr Antonio Bernardino Almeida 400, P-4200072 Porto, Portugal.

IEEE,A Novel Bio-Inspired Predictive Model for Spam Filtering Based on    Dendritic Cell Algorithm,,2014,,,89-95,,"Electronic mail has become the most popular, frequently-used and    powerful medium for quicker personal and business communications.    However, one of the common security issues and annoying problems faced    by email users and organizations is receiving a large number of    unsolicited email messages, known as spam emails, every day. A    traditional countermeasure in most email systems nowadays is simple    filtering mechanisms that can block or quarantine unwanted emails based    on some keywords defined by the user. These filters require continual    effort to keep them relevant and current with some extensions proposed    to improve their performance. However, due to the gigantic volumes of    received emails and the continual change in spamming techniques to    bypass the implemented solutions, novel automated ideas and    countermeasures need to be investigated. This paper explores a novel    algorithm inspired by the immune system called dendritic cell algorithm    (DCA). This algorithm is evaluated on a number of benchmark datasets to    detect spam emails. The results demonstrate that this approach can be a    promising solution for email classification and spam filtering.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"El-Alfy, EM (Corresponding Author), King Fahd Univ Petr \& Minerals, Coll Comp Sci \& Engn, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia.

This paper describes the development of a Trust in Technical    Controls Scale (TTCS) that measures people's faith in four of these    technical controls. In an online study (N = 607), Australian employees    demonstrated a greater degree of trust in firewalls and anti-virus    software than they did in spam filters and social media privacy    settings. Lower scores on the four item TTCS were related to better    information security awareness (ISA) and higher scores on tests of    cognitive abilities such as non-verbal IQ and cognitive reflection. The    TTCS predicted an individual's ability to detect a phishing email to a    similar degree as other factors such as ISA, non-verbal IQ and cognitive    impulsivity. However, unlike ISA, the scale did not predict the strength    of passwords people constructed. Results suggest that the TTCS is a    useful complement to ISA in understanding and predicting certain cyber    security behaviours. Crown Copyright (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We propose to protect email privacy by building    encryption functionality into ESMTP mailers. Our solution, ssmail,    provides fast, simple encryption for sendmail that does not require user    intervention or reliance on public key infrastructure. We added a small    number of steps to an ESMTP session, thereby allowing a client and    server to create a secret, one-time session key used to encrypt the mail    transfer session, ssmail relies on caching to reduce key generation    overhead. The overhead imposed by our encryption scheme is minimal,    allowing even busy mail servers to support privacy.    We placed our encryption mechanism within the mail transfer agent itself    allowing people to use privacy protection software without having to    know how to run an encryption program explicitly Furthermore, we are    able to encrypt the email transmission session, protecting such    information as sender and recipient identities. The speed and simplicity    of ssmail make it a very useful addition to widely deployed ESMTP    mailers.

This exploratory study examines    user preferences with regard to virtual reference services and factors    that account for these preferences from a different vantage point than    previous literature by relying on semi-structured interviews with users.    Using NVivo qualitative data analysis software, I coded interview    transcripts and applied grounded theory to identify preferences from    among email to the library, email to a liaison librarian, chat and    texting. In terms of virtual reference methods currently offered by the    library, participants indicated a general preference for chat,    highlighting the importance of this service. However, participants were    reluctant to use chat on mobile phones, their most used communication    technology. Findings also show that relational aspects are major factors    influencing participants' choice of communication. Specifically,    participants expressed a preference for modes of communication that are    personal, informal, perceived as safe and secure and conversational.    Participants expressed reservations for texting due to ambiguity about    response times, the perception of the method as being too personal and    safety and security concerns. Participants were reluctant to use email    in general due to response times and its level of formality, but valued    email with their liaison librarian for its level of personalness and the    level of expertise they felt that the liaison librarian could offer.    Understanding these preferences and the factors that account for them is    important because it can influence which virtual reference services    librarians choose to offer. It can also help to determine how well    virtual reference provision is currently meeting user needs and identify    ways service delivery and promotion can be improved.",ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",Article,English,"Mawhinney, T (Corresponding Author), McGill Univ Lib, McLennan Redpath Lib Complex,3459 McTavish St, Montreal, PQ H3A 0C9, Canada.

This study    conducted a large-scale anti-phishing training with more than 31000    participants and 144 different simulated phishing attacks to develop a    data-driven model to classify how users would perceive a phishing    simulation. Furthermore, we analyze the results of our large-scale    anti-phishing training and give novel insights into users' click    behavior. Analyzing our anti-phishing training data, we find out that    66\% of users do not fall victim to credential-based phishing attacks    even after being exposed to twelve weeks of phishing simulations. To    further enhance the phishing awareness-training effectiveness, we    developed a novel manifold learning-powered machine learning model that    can predict how many people would fall for a phishing simulation using    the several structural and state-of-the-art NLP features extracted from    the emails. In this way, we present a systematic approach for the    training implementers to estimate the average ``convincing power{''} of    the emails prior to rolling out. Moreover, we revealed the top-most    vital factors in the classification. In addition, our model presents    significant benefits over traditional rule-based approaches in    classifying the difficulty of phishing simulations. Our results clearly    show that anti-phishing training should focus on the training of    individual users rather than on large user groups.

"Brunnstein, K",Analysis of JAVA security and hostile applets,,1997,,BH92U,293-295,,"Rapid growth of Internet was only possible when document description    languages (esp. HTML), exchange protocols (HTTP) and navigation tools    such as Netscape's browser and Internet Explorer were available for mass    usage. Basic Internet features (protocols, esp. TCP/IP, domain    organisation and routing concepts), navigation tools and document    description languages have been specified without observing relevant    security requirements, esp. concerning confidentiality of sensitive    processes and data. Moreover, essential safety aspects - availability,    reliability, maintainability, functionality - have also been neglected.    As security and safety are `'design-inherent'' features (i.e. they must    be specified in design and enforced in implemented systems), later    enhancements (such as IP v.6 including authentication and encryption,    protocols such as S-HTTP, SSL or SET) can at best reduce risks, but they    can NOT cure past design faults.    Within this insecure and unsafe Internet environment, `'agent''    technologies develop, which perform net-''work'' with usually small    processes which interoperate at an assumed benefit of users. A multitude    of agents applications has been discussed, including delegation of    tasks, handling email, coordination of group work and scheduling, mobile    knowledge robots, distributed searches and many others. Early examples    of agent technologies (though not named as such) have been XEROXs worms    (which materialized in several network experiements and attacks) and    chain letters. Started either automatically or from a users desktop (or    better: WebTop), agents work in hidden manners. Therefore, security and    safety aspects as well as mechanisms to control agents must be carefully    analysed from design to implementation and actual work.    JAVA was announced in 1996, by Sun Microsystems (in a `'White Paper'')    as 4G-language for Internet applications. It supports development and    execution of small agents, called `'applets'' which are executed upon a    specific software engine (conceptually similar to Niklaus Wirth's p-Code    for Pascal).    According to Sun's summary: Java is a simple, object-oriented,    distributed, interpreted, robust, secure, architecture neutral,    portable, high-performance, multi-threaded, and dynamic language.''    The C++-like JAVA-language has several deliberate restrictions, which    according to Sun shall guarantee applet security. Among such    restrictions, access to files and Internet address space (URLs) is    strictly prohibited, and memory management (including garbage    collection) is automatic; user-manipulated pointers are not supported in    JAVA. As manipulation of memory (e.g. via memory residence) and    manipulation of files are regarded as essential means with which    (traditional) viruses propagate, some experts and Sun assume that JAVA    viruses are `'impossible''; in a counterposition, others (such as Bill    Cheswick) have regarded JAVA as `'ideal virus writing language''.    Besides language restrictions, JAVA offers more security features. A    special class of services `'security.java'' supports encryption,    authentication (digital signatures), secure key exchange and integrity    mechanisms (checksumming). On this basis, applets may be authorized and    authenticated. This provides a secure channel to the manufacturer which    is `'secure'' if and when the manufacturer is regarded trustworthy. An    additional feature is that JAVA applets are executed upon ist own    interpreter; JAVA code can then be verified for conformance with    security prescriptions (byte-code verifier).    With these enhancements, JAVA is much better than almost all other    language systems though it is inferior to Secure ADA which offers also    formal methods for proof of specified features (this is not foreseen in    JAVA which does not hide its medium-level origin: it is similar to    C/C++). Nevertheless, JAVA applets are far from being `'secure''. First,    any hidden manipulation within the scope of the language is possible; it    is therefore no surprise that `'hostile applets'' have soon been    demonstrated on Internet, ranging from rather `'innocent'' Noisy.Bear''    which `'only'' consumes processor time and memory, to `'Killer-java''    which installs multiple threads and kills some browsers. These applets    can be classified as `'malicious trojan horses''; they do NOT replicate    but may nevertheless harmfully affect user data and processes.More    generally, `'security'' is a feature of a system whithin properly    specified boundaries. When JAVA applets execute on insecure systems    (ranging from hardware to operationg systems to browsers and file    systems), insecure use is possible despite JAVA restrictions. So far,    insecure interactions of JAVA applets with browsers (esp. Netscape's)    have been discussed (Princeton University). So far, self-reproduction    has not been demonstrated. Moreover, essential safety aspects -    availability, reliability, maintainability, functionality - have also    been neglected in JAVA design.    Conclusion: though JAVA has some security features, applets enlarges the    risk of agent technologies. Based on insecure systems such as operating    systems and browsers, risks of JAVA applets for sensitive information is    significant.",CHAPMAN \& HALL,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",Proceedings Paper,English,"Brunnstein, K (Corresponding Author), UNIV HAMBURG,MARTINISTR 52,HAMBURG,GERMANY.",,,,,Business \& Economics; Computer Science,"Business; Computer Science, Information Systems",inproceedings,WOS:A1997BH92U00023,"Yngstrom, L and Carlsen, J",INFORMATION SECURITY IN RESEARCH AND BUSINESS,,"IFIP TC11 13th International Conference on Information Security (SEC    97), COPENHAGEN, DENMARK, MAY 14-16, 1997",0-412-81780-2,,"Int Federat Informat Proc, TC11",,0,0,1,1,,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),WOS:A1997BH92U00023,2025-07-09,,,,,
AAAI,Optimizing Personalized Email Filtering Thresholds to Mitigate    Sequential Spear Phishing Attacks,,2016,,,658-664,,"Highly targeted spear phishing attacks are increasingly common, and have    been implicated in many major security breeches. Email filtering systems    are the first line of defense against such attacks. These filters are    typically configured with uniform thresholds for deciding whether or not    to allow a message to be delivered to a user. However, users have very    significant differences in both their susceptibility to phishing attacks    as well as their access to critical information and credentials that can    cause damage. Recent work has considered setting personalized thresholds    for individual users based on a Stackelberg game model. We consider two    important extensions of the previous model. First, in our model user    values can be substitutable, modeling cases where multiple users provide    access to the same information or credential. Second, we consider    attackers who make sequential attack plans based on the outcome of    previous attacks. Our analysis starts from scenarios where there is only    one credential and then extends to more general scenarios with multiple    credentials. For single-credential scenarios, we demonstrate that the    optimal defense strategy can be found by solving a binary combinatorial    optimization problem called PEDS. For multiple-credential scenarios, we    formulate it as a bilevel optimization problem for finding the optimal    defense strategy and then reduce it to a single level optimization    problem called PEMS using complementary slackness conditions.    Experimental results show that both PEDS and PEMS lead to significant    higher defender utilities than two existing benchmarks in different    parameter settings. Also, both PEDS and PEMS are more robust than the    existing benchmarks considering uncertainties.",ASSOC ADVANCEMENT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,"2275 E BAYSHORE RD, STE 160, PALO ALTO, CA 94303 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Zhao, MC (Corresponding Author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Comp Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore.

We ran three experiments to determine    whether the system could (1) reliably authenticate account holders, (2)    resist email attacks that target trustees by impersonating account    holders, and (3) resist phone-based attacks from individuals close to    account holders. Results were encouraging: seventeen of the nineteen    participants who made the effort to call trustees authenticated    successfully.

Various types of information security instruments in an institution    cannot provide maximum protection as long as employees still have a low    level of information security awareness. This study aims to measure the    level of information security awareness of government employees through    case studies at the Directorate General of ABC (DG ABC) in Indonesia.    This study used two methods, behavior approach through phishing    simulation and knowledge approach through a questionnaire on a Likert    scale. The simulation results were analyzed on a percentage scale and    compared to the results of the questionnaire to determine the level of    employees' information security awareness and determine which method was    the best. Results show a significant relationship between the simulation    results and the questionnaire results. Among the employees who opened    the email, 69\% clicked on the link that led to the camouflage page and    through the questionnaire, it was found that the information security    awareness level of DG ABC employees was at the level of 79.32\% which    was the lower limit of the GOOD category.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Ramli, K (Corresponding Author), Univ Indonesia, Dept Elect Engn, Depok, Indonesia.

The architecture of this integrated module provided many    advantages. First, the ESR module was developed based on a comprehensive    procedure which incorporated both computer logic processing steps and    human intervention steps in order to deal with the complex and    unexpected situations where pre-programmed computer logic may fail.    Second, safety and efficacy data were managed within the same relational    database. Relevant data captured on efficacy case report forms, such as    demographics, medical history, lab data and concomitant medications,    were directly retrievable for MedWatch report composition without    requiring redundant data entry. Finally, the ESR module shared the same    generic user interfaces and data processing functions with other modules    in the CTMS. These generic components include data editing, data    retrieving, data reporting, dictionary-based automatic and interactive    coding, event-driven and calendar-driven automatic email notifications,    and user privilege management. This integrated ESR module was    implemented in the Albumin in Acute Stroke (ALIAS) Trial Part 1. A total    of 397 serious adverse event reports were processed and 33 FDA MedWatch    reports, 28 initial reports, and 5 follow-up reports were submitted to    FDA and Health Canada using this system.

Hence this has given a growing    need for spam email analysis to identify these attacks. The use of these    intrusion detection systems has given rise to other two issues, 1) the    presentation and understanding of large amounts of spam emails, 2) the    user-assisted input and quantified adjustment during the analysis    process. In this paper we introduce a new analytical model that uses two    coefficient vectors: `density' and `weight' for the analysis of spam    email viruses and attacks. We then use a visual clustering method to    classify and display the spam emails. The visualization allows users to    interactively select and scale down the scope of views for better    understanding of different types of the spam email attacks.

Design/methodology/approach - A Web-based questionnaire (the Human    Aspects of Information Security Questionnaire - HAIS-Q) was used in two    separate studies to assess the ISA of individuals who used computers at    their workplace. The first study assessed 198 employees at an Australian    bank and the second study assessed 500 working Australians from various    industries. Both studies used a Qualtrics-based questionnaire that was    distributed via an email link.    Findings - The results showed that the average level of ISA among bank    employees was consistently 20 per cent higher than that among general    workforce participants in all focus areas and overall. There were no    significant differences between the ISA scores for those who received    more frequent training compared to those who received less frequent    training. This result suggests that the frequency of training is not a    contributing factor to an employee's level of ISA.    Research limitations/implications - This current research did not    investigate the information security (InfoSec) culture that prevailed    within the bank in question because the objective of the research was to    compare a bank's employees with general workforce employees rather than    compare organisations. The Research did not include questions relating    to the type of training participants had received at work.    Originality/value - This study provided the bank's InfoSec management    with evidence that their multi-channelled InfoSec training regime was    responsible for a substantially higher-than-average ISA for their    employees. Future research of this nature should examine the    effectiveness of various ISA programmes in light of individual    differences and learning styles. This would form the basis of an    adaptive control framework that would complement many of the current    international standards, such as ISO's 27000 series, NIST's SP800 series    and ISACA's COBIT5.",EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Pattinson, M (Corresponding Author), Univ Adelaide, Adelaide Business Sch, Adelaide, SA, Australia.

This threat is known as an ``Insider IT    Sabotage{''} threat. This involves employees misusing their access    rights to harm the organization. Events leading up to the attack are not    technical but rather behavioural. The problem is that owing to the high    volume and complexity of emails, the risk of insider IT sabotage cannot    be diminished with rule-based approaches.    Design/methodology/approach    Malicious human behaviours that insiders within the insider IT sabotage    category would possess are studied and mapped to phrases that would    appear in email communications. A large email data set is classified    according to behavioural characteristics of these employees. Machine    learning algorithms are used to identify occurrences of this insider    threat type. The accuracy of these approaches is measured.    Findings    It is shown in this paper that suspicious behaviour of disgruntled    employees can be discovered, by means of machine intelligence    techniques. The output of the machine learning classifier depends mainly    on the depth and quality of the phrases and behaviour analysis,    cleansing and number of email attributes examined. This process of    labelling content in isolation could be improved if other attributes of    the email data are included, such that a confidence score can be    computed for each user.

Many    organizations provide their employees with security awareness training    to counter and mitigate such threats. However, recent studies have shown    that current embedded phishing training programs and tools are often    ineffective or incapable of addressing modern, tailored social    engineering attacks. This paper presents a toolkit for the deployment of    sophisticated, tailored phishing campaigns at scale (e.g., to deploy    specific training within an organization). We enable the use of highly    customizable phishing email templates that can be instantiated with a    large range of information about the specific target and a    semi-automated process for the selection of the phishing domain name. We    demonstrate our tool by showing how tailored phishing campaigns proposed    in previous studies can be enhanced to increase the credibility of the    phishing email, effectively addressing the very limitations identified    in those studies.",SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",Proceedings Paper,English,"Zannone, N (Corresponding Author), Eindhoven Univ Technol, Eindhoven, Netherlands.

Every user has    access to the contents of a certain subset of storage nodes and wants to    decode an independent secret message. With knowledge of K secret    messages, the main node strategically places encoded shares in the    storage nodes, ensuring two crucial conditions: (i) each user can    recover its own secret message from the storage nodes that it has access    to; (ii) each user is unable to acquire any information regarding the    collection of \$K-1\$ secret messages for all the other users. The rate    of each user is defined as the size of its secret message normalized by    the size of a storage node. We characterize the capacity region of the    DMUSS problem, which is the closure of the set of all achievable rate    tuples that satisfy the correctness and perfect secrecy conditions. The    converse proof relies on a bound from the traditional single-secret    sharing regime. In the achievability proof, we firstly design the linear    decoding functions, based on the fact that each secret message needs to    be recovered from a single set of storage nodes. It turns out that the    perfect secrecy condition holds if K matrices, whose entries are    extracted from the decoding functions, are full rank. We prove that the    decoding functions can be constructed explicitly if the rate tuple    satisfies the converse and the field size is not less than K. At last,    the encoding functions are obtained by solving the system of linear    decoding functions, where some shares are equal to the randomness and    the other shares are linear combinations of the secret messages and the    randomness.",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Article,English,"Liu, N (Corresponding Author), Southeast Univ, Natl Mobile Commun Res Lab, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China.

IEEE,MPCAuth: Multi-factor Authentication for Distributed-trust Systems,,2023,,,829-847,,"Systems with distributed trust have attracted growing research attention    and seen increasing industry adoptions. In these systems, critical    secrets are distributed across N servers, and computations are performed    privately using secure multi-party computation (SMPC). Authentication    for these distributed-trust systems faces two challenges. The first    challenge is ease-of-use. Namely, how can an authentication protocol    maintain its user experience without sacrificing security? To avoid a    central point of attack, a client needs to authenticate to each server    separately. However, this would require the client to authenticate N    times for each authentication factor, which greatly hampers usability.    The second challenge is privacy, as the client's sensitive profiles are    now exposed to all N servers under different trust domains, which    creates N times the attack surface for the profile data. We present    MPCAuth, a multi-factor authentication system for distributed-trust    applications that address both challenges. Our system enables a client    to authenticate to N servers independently with the work of only one    authentication. In addition, our system is profile hiding, meaning that    the client's authentication profiles such as her email username, phone    number, passwords, and biometric features are not revealed unless all    servers are compromised. We propose secure and practical protocols for    an array of widely adopted authentication factors, including email    passcodes, SMS messages, U2F, security questions/passwords, and    biometrics. Our system finds practical applications in the space of    cryptocurrency custody and collaborative machine learning, and benefits    future adoptions of distributed-trust applications.",IEEE COMPUTER SOC,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Tan, SJ (Corresponding Author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.

"Heuer, Felix and Poettering, Bertram",Selective Opening Security from Simulatable Data Encapsulation,,2016,10032,,248-277,,"In the realm of public-key encryption, the confidentiality notion of    security against selective opening (SO) attacks considers adversaries    that obtain challenge ciphertexts and are allowed to adaptively open    them, meaning have the corresponding message and randomness revealed. SO    security is stronger than IND-CCA and often required when formally    arguing towards the security of multi-user applications. While different    ways of achieving SO secure schemes are known, as they generally employ    expensive asymmetric building blocks like lossy trapdoor functions or    lossy encryption, such constructions are routinely left aside by    practitioners and standardization bodies. So far, formal arguments    towards the SO security of schemes used in practice (e.g., for email    encryption) are not known.    In this work we shift the focus from the asymmetric to the symmetric    building blocks of PKE and prove the following statement: If a PKE    scheme is composed of a key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) and a    blockcipher-based data encapsulation mechanism (DEM), and the DEM has    specific combinatorial properties, then the PKE scheme offers SO    security in the ideal cipher model. Fortunately, as we show, the    required properties hold for popular modes of operation like CTR, CBC    and CCM.

The focus is on the writing of managers with    above-average levels of conscientiousness and agreeableness, as these    personality factors are predictors of efficacy in the completion of two    work-related goals, Achievement and Communion, according to the Theory    of Purposeful Work Behavior. The linguistic patterns responsible for    effective email communication are identified through both automated and    qualitative textual analyses of the email sample. The study has    implications for management training via the assumption that linguistic    patterns that a reflexive manager uses in writing are subjected to    monitoring and can be modeled and adapted to.

ACM,DIVINA: Discovering Vulnerabilities of Internet Accounts,,2015,,,203-206,,"Internet users typically have several online accounts such as mail    accounts, cloud storage accounts, or social media accounts. The security    of these accounts is often intricately linked: The password of one    account can be reset by sending an email to another account; the data of    one account can be backed up on another account; one account can only be    accessed by two-factor authentication through a second account; and so    forth. This poses three challenges: First, if a user loses one or    several of his passwords, can he still access his data? Second, how many    passwords does an attacker need in order to access the data? And    finally, how many passwords does an attacker need in order to    irreversibly delete the user's data? In this paper, we model the    dependencies of online accounts in order to help the user discover    security weaknesses.

Alphanumeric passwords are    more helpless to attacks like shoulder surfing, dictionary attacks,    etc., than graphical passwords. The creation of more muddled,    challenging to-break passwords can be made simpler for clients with    graphical authentication by consolidating the visuals and memory-based    strategies like recall and recognition. In an imaged-based password, the    user can choose pixels from the image to use as a secret key in the    grid-based strategy, the user-selected image would show up on the screen    with a framework overlay on it, and the client can pick explicit    lattices to set their secret phrase. Besides, graphical passwords are    powerless against shoulder surfing attacks, and due to this, clients are    given a one-time made password via email. We investigated the    limitations of image-based and grid-based authentication techniques and    propose a grid-based graphical authentication system that addresses the    limitations of image-based and grid-based techniques. The results of the    grid-based graphical technique, as well as the image-based and    grid-based approaches, have likewise been differentiated and analyzed.    The convenience objective of our authentication system is to assist    users in making better password selections, hence boosting security and    broadening the usable password field.

IEEE,Evaluation of the Effective Anti-Phishing Awareness and Training in    Governmental and Private Organizations in Riyadh,,2018,,,,,"Phishing is a form of attacks that conduct by tricking the users to be    as legitimate entity or user. With a huge usage of electronic mail,    email phishing attacks become the common type of electronic phishing. As    a result, the organizations become an attractive target to the attackers    in order to steal the organization's sensitive information or to do    malicious actions. From this point, the anti-phishing awareness and    training is considered as a persistent need. In this paper, the    researchers focus on the electronic mail phishing that target    governmental and private organizations in Riyadh. The researchers    evaluate the current security training and awareness of employees in    Riyadh through a survey. This paper discusses the result of measuring    the electronic mail phishing awareness of the governmental and private    organization in Riyadh.

USENIX Assoc,Security and Privacy Perceptions of Third-Party Application Access for    Google Accounts,,2022,,BT8TA,3397-3414,,"Online services like Google provide a variety of application programming    interfaces (APIs). These online APIs enable authenticated third-party    services and applications (apps) to access a user's account data for    tasks such as single sign-on (SSO), calendar integration, and sending    email on behalf of the user, among others. Despite their prevalence, API    access could pose significant privacy and security risks, where a    third-party could have unexpected privileges to a user's account. To    gauge users' perceptions and concerns regarding third-party apps that    integrate with online APIs, we performed a multi-part online survey of    Google users. First, we asked n = 432 participants to recall if and when    they allowed third-party access to their Google account: 89\% recalled    using at least one SSO and 52\% remembered at least one third-party app.    In the second survey, we re-recruited n = 214 participants to ask about    specific apps and SSOs they've authorized on their own Google accounts.    We collected in-the-wild data about users' actual SSOs and authorized    apps: 86\% used Google SSO on at least one service, and 67\% had at    least one third-party app authorized. After examining their apps and    SSOs, participants expressed the most concern about access to personal    information like email addresses and other publicly shared info.    However, participants were less concerned with broader-and perhaps more    invasive-access to calendars, emails, or cloud storage (as needed by    third-party apps). This discrepancy may be due in part to trust    transference to apps that integrate with Google, forming an implied    partnership. Our results suggest opportunities for design improvements    to the current third-party management tools offered by Google; for    example, tracking recent access, automatically revoking access due to    app disuse, and providing permission controls.",USENIX ASSOC,"SUITE 215, 2560 NINTH ST, BERKELEY, CA 94710 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Balash, DG (Corresponding Author), George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA.

However, when multiple systems are involved, the user is then required    to authenticate to each system individually and repeatedly. It results    in inconvenience to each authentication. Recently, to overcome the    problem, an identity-based single-sign-on scheme was proposed to achieve    user identification and authentication to multiple security-protected    systems simultaneously through a single operation. The security of the    scheme is claimed to be related to the well-Known RSA cryptosystem and    the discrete logarithm problem.

ACM,Use-After-FreeMail: Generalizing the Use-After-Free Problem and Applying    it to Email Services,,2018,,BO5BA,297-311,,"Use-after-free is a type of vulnerability commonly present in software    written in memory-unsafe languages like C or C++, where a program frees    a memory buffer too early. By placing counterfeit structures at the    freed memory location, an attacker can leak information or gain    execution control upon subsequent access.    In this paper, we show that the concept of use-after-free can be    generalized to any environment and situation where resources can be    silently exchanged. As an instance of our generalization we demonstrate    Use-After-FreeMail attacks. Use-After-FreeMail attacks gather email    addresses from publicly available database leaks. The fully automated    quantitative analysis brought to light that 33.5\% of all free-mail    addresses we tested are not valid anymore. In two user studies with 100    and 31 participants we found that 11-19\% of users are affected by our    attack. In qualitative case studies we investigated what information can    be gained in Use-After-FreeMail attacks, e.g., payment information, and    how far currently used accounts can be compromised (identity theft).    Finally, drawing the connection between mitigations against traditional    use-afterfree scenarios and the Use-After-FreeMail scenario, we provide    a concise list of recommendations to free-mail providers and users as a    protection against use-after-free attacks.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Proceedings Paper,English,"Gruss, D (Corresponding Author), Graz Univ Technol, Graz, Austria.

IEEE,Enabling Off-the-grid Communication for Existing Applications: A Case    Study of Email Access,,2018,,,,,"Most of today's applications require an Internet connection to reach    cloud servers essential for their functioning. However, in many    scenarios, such connectivity is unavailable, such as when a user is in a    remote location with no cellular coverage or during a natural disaster.    In these situations, nearby devices can still connect to each other, and    the applications running on each device can have data useful to each    other; however, the applications are unable to exchange data directly    between themselves.    In this paper, we describe mechanisms to enable off-the-grid    communication for existing applications, allowing them to directly    exchange data between themselves. To achieve this goal, an application    should be capable of discovering, fetching, and verifying data without    the help of a server. We believe that Named Data Networking (NDN) can    provide an application with these abilities. We utilize email access as    a study case and propose mailSync, a framework to the goal of app-to-app    communication for this application via NDN. Meanwhile, we identify the    various differences between TCP/IP and NDN applications, and we    generalize several steps to ``NDNize{''} an existing application,    including protocol translation, application layer framing, naming, data    discovery and security management. We implemented a prototype of    mailSync in Java on laptop and Android as a proof of concept.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Liang, T (Corresponding Author), Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.

This    paper presents a study investigating how human behavior, especially    mouse movements, may reflect cybersecurity awareness, in particular to    phishing emails. Using an email sorting task, we examined three key    mouse movement features: hover, slow movement, and response time. The    results suggest that slow mouse movements indicate high awareness of    phishing emails and could be used to determine the likelihood of users    falling victim to phishing attacks.

IEEE,Please Hold On: Unobtrusive User Authentication using Smartphone's    built-in Sensors,,2017,,,,,"Smartphones provide anytime-anywhere communications and are being    increasingly used for a variety of purposes, e. g, sending email,    performing online transactions, connecting with friends and    acquaintances over social networks. As a result, a considerable amount    of sensitive personal information is often generated and stored on    smartphones. Thus, smartphone users may face financial as well as    sentimental consequences if such information fall in the wrong hands. To    address this problem all smartphones provide some form of user    authentication, that is the process of verifying the user's identity.    Existing authentication mechanisms, such as using 4-digit passcodes or    graphical patterns, suffer from multiple limitations -they are neither    highly secure nor easy to input. As a results, recent studies found that    most smartphone's users do not use any authentication mechanism at all.    In this paper, we present a fully unobtrusive user authentication scheme    based on micromovements of the user's hand(s) after the user unlocks her    smartphone. The proposed scheme collects data from multiple 3    -dimensional smartphone sensors in the background for a specific period    of time and profiles a user based on the collected hand(s) movement    patterns. Subsequently, the system matches the query pattern with the    pre-stored patterns to authenticate the smartphone owner. Our system    achieved a True Acceptance Rate (TAR) of 9 6 \% at an Equal Error Rate    (EER) of 4 \%, on a dataset of 3 1 qualified volunteers (5 3, in total),    using Random Forest (RF) classifier. Our scheme can be used as a primary    authentication mechanism or can be used as a secondary authentication    scheme in conjunction with any of the existing authentication schemes,    e. g., passcodes, to improve their security.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Buriro, A (Corresponding Author), Univ Trento, Trento, Italy.

(2) We exploit in-band signaling in the    GnuPG API, the most widely used OpenPGP implementation. (3) We apply    MIME wrapping attacks that abuse the email clients' handling of    partially signed messages. (4) We analyze weaknesses in the binding of    signed messages to the sender identity. (5) We systematically test email    clients for UI redressing attacks.    Our attacks allow the spoofing of digital signatures for arbitrary    messages in 14 out of 20 tested OpenPGP-capable email clients and 15 out    of 22 email clients supporting S/MIME signatures.

"Chen, Gang and Wu, Sai and Wang, Yuan",The Evolvement of Big Data Systems: From the Perspective of an    Information Security Application,BIG DATA RESEARCH,2015,2,2,65-73,JUN,"Recently, Google revealed that it has replaced the 10-year old MapReduce    with its new systems (e.g., DataFlow) which can provide better    performances and support more sophisticated applications.    Simultaneously, other new systems, such as Spark, Impala and epiC, are    also being developed to handle new requirements for big data processing.    The fact shows that since their emergence, big data techniques are    changing very fast. In this paper, we use our experience in developing    and maintaining the information security system for Netease as an    example to illustrate how those big data systems evolve. In particular,    our first version is a Hadoop-based offline detection system, which is    soon replaced by a more flexible online streaming system. Our ongoing    work is to build a generic real-time analytic system for Netease to    handle various jobs such as email spam detection, user pattern mining,    game log analysis, etc. The example shows how the requirements of users    (e.g., Netease and its clients) affect the design of big data system and    drive the advance of technologies.

"Almeshekah, Mohammed H. and Atallah, Mikhail J. and Spafford, Eugene H.",Enhancing Passwords Security Using Deceptive Covert Communication,,2015,455,,159-173,,"The use of deception to enhance security has shown promising results as    a defensive technique. In this paper we present an authentication scheme    that better protects users' passwords than in currently deployed    password-based schemes, without taxing the users' memory or damaging the    user-friendliness of the login process. Our scheme maintains    comparability with traditional password-based authentication, without    any additional storage requirements, giving service providers the    ability to selectively enroll users and fall-back to traditional methods    if needed. The scheme utilizes the ubiquity of smartphones; however,    unlike previous proposals it does not require registration or    connectivity of the phones used. In addition, no long-term secrets are    stored in any user's phone, mitigating the consequences of losing it.    Our design significantly increases the difficulty of launching a    phishing attack by automating the decisions of whether a website should    be trusted and introducing additional risk at the adversary side of    being detected and deceived. In addition, the scheme is resilient    against Man-in-the-Browser (MitB) attacks and compromised client    machines. We also introduce a covert communication mechanism between the    user's client and the service provider. This can be used to covertly and    securely communicate the user's context that comes with the use of this    mechanism. The scheme also incorporates the use of deception that makes    it possible to dismantle a large-scale attack infrastructure before it    succeeds. As an added feature, the scheme gives service providers the    ability to have full-transaction authentication.    With the use of our scheme, passwords are no longer communicated in    plaintext format to the server, adding another layer of protection when    secure channels of communication are compromised. Moreover, it gives    service providers the ability to deploy risk-based authentication. It    introduces the ability to make dynamic multi-level access decisions    requiring extra authentication steps when needed. Finally, the scheme's    covert channel mechanisms give servers the ability to utilize a user's    context information - detecting the use of untrusted networks or whether    the login was based on a solicitation email.",SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",Proceedings Paper,English,"Almeshekah, MH (Corresponding Author), Purdue Univ, Dept Comp Sci, 305 N Univ St, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.

Assoc Comp Machinery,Upside and Downside Risk in Online Security for Older Adults with Mild    Cognitive Impairment,,2019,,,,,"Older adults are rapidly increasing their use of online services such as    banking, social media, and email - services that come with subtle and    serious security and privacy risks. Older adults with mild cognitive    impairment (MCI) are particularly vulnerable to these risks because MCI    can reduce their ability to recognize scams such as email phishing,    follow recommended password guidelines, and consider the implications of    sharing personal information. Older adults with MCI often cope with    their impairments with the help of caregivers, including partners,    children, and professional health personnel, when using and managing    online services. Yet, this too carries security and privacy risks:    sharing personal information with caregivers can create issues of    agency, autonomy, and even risk embarrassment and information leakage;    caregivers also do not always act in their charges' best interest.    Through a series of interviews conducted in the US, we identify a    spectrum of safeguarding strategies used and consider them through the    lens of `upside and downside risk' where there are tradeoffs between    reduced privacy and maintaining older adults' autonomy and access to    online services.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Proceedings Paper,English,"Mentis, HM (Corresponding Author), Univ Maryland Baltimore Cty, Dept Informat Syst, Baltimore, MD 21228 USA.

The lack of computing    resources in some consumer electronics (e.g., wearable medical devices)    and the inherent security issues such as untrustworthy cloud service    providers (CSPs) inevitably lead to unreliable data sharing. Therefore,    how to ensure the security, efficiency and scalability of private data    sharing with limited resources in consumer electronics is one of the hot    topics. However, data encryption schemes that use a single authority    typically have high key generation costs, and the data integrity of    which can hardly be guaranteed. In this paper, we propose a    blockchain-assisted, highly secure access control scheme for    AIoT-enabled, human centric consumer electronics. The novel scheme,    called ERACMA, supports expressive and revocable access control with    multi-authority using attribute-based encryption. The scheme uses    multiple attribute authorities to split the key generation, reducing the    generation time of the decryption key. Blockchain is utilized to ensure    the integrity of private consumer electronics data. Data source    identification can be used by human-centric consumer electronics    applications to determine the validity and legitimacy of data. The    scheme also supports dynamic user group management to address the user    license expiration issues involved in consumer applications. A formal    definition and concrete construction of ERACMA are also presented, with    a security proof under the random oracle. Extensive comparative and    experimental analysis has revealed the superior functionality and    efficient performance of our scheme which is well-suited for    human-centric consumer electronics.",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Article,English,"Wang, C (Corresponding Author), Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Sch Informat Sci \& Engn, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China.

The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of    the AAL field with a focus on healthcare frameworks, platforms,    standards, and quality attributes. To achieve this, we conducted a    literature survey of state-of-the-art AAL frameworks, systems and    platforms to identify the essential aspects of AAL systems and    investigate the critical issues from the design, technology,    quality-of-service, and user experience perspectives. In addition, we    conducted an email-based survey for collecting usage data and current    status of contemporary AAL systems. We found that most AAL systems are    confined to a limited set of features ignoring many of the essential AAL    system aspects. Standards and technologies are used in a limited and    isolated manner, while quality attributes are often addressed    insufficiently.

Parents cite a myriad of reasons    why they worry about their child using opioids. The MedSMART Families    intervention, which includes a Family Medication Safety Plan (FMSP), is    a tool designed to support families in learning and communicating about    safe prescription opioid use in their homes and with health care    providers.    Objective: This study's first aim was to examine adolescents'    experiences with using the FMSP. The second aim of this study was to    identify opportunities for future improvement.    Methods: Adolescents, aged 12-18 years, were recruited from April 2021    to October 2021. They were recruited through Qualtrics research panels,    email listservs, social media, and snowball sampling. Adolescents    reviewed the FMSP and then completed a semistructured follow-up    interview with a study team member virtually. The interviews were    professionally transcribed verbatim, reviewed by the study team for    accuracy, and downloaded into NVivo for analysis. Main themes were    identified using content and thematic analysis.    Results: Adolescents (N = 65) reviewed the FMSP and participated in the    study. Adolescents found the FMSP to be acceptable and useful for    prompting discussions with parents about not only opioids, but all    medications being used by the youth. Study participants suggested key    improvements such as the creation of a kid-friendly or Spanish language    version to improve accessibility and uptake by a diverse population of    teens.    Conclusion: Adolescents reported that the FMSP would be a helpful tool    for their families. Implementing this tool at the point of prescribing    or dispensing is a potential strategy to reduce the rates of opioid    misuse, reduce hesitancy, and allow adolescents more agency regarding    their health care and medication management.

But there are certain problems with this; the user may forget his    password or the account may be hacked by the attacker. The web services    nowadays provide users' with an alternative email address or security    question to recover password. Unfortunately, this authentication    mechanism is insecure or unreliable.    To overcome the drawbacks of this mechanism, a backup mechanism for    account recovery is considered. Backup authentication mechanism helps    the users' to regain accounts with the help of trusted friends. In this    mechanism user depends on multiple trustees and recover their account    via verification mails. A trust model which is implemented in social    networking sites is associated with an authentication protocol. Trust    evaluation models are really needed in smart environments is that they    create a secure yet more flexible environments because security policies    cannot do that.

Current enterprise systems are vulnerable to social    engineering attacks. In addition, existing detection methods are    relatively ineffective. Therefore, we propose a double-layer detection    framework based on deep learning technology. First, a phishing email    detection model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and extreme    gradient boosting tree (XGBoost) is designed from the perspective of    individual security. Then, an insider threat detection model based on    Bidirectional LSTM and Attention mechanism is designed from the    perspective of group security. Finally, combined with the social    engineering network attack simulation theory, a social engineering    attack and defense simulation platform is established. In the    double-layer frame-work, we use Bi-LSTM to obtain long-range dependent    features of email body and user sequence information. Then XGBoost and    Attention mechanism are used to further strengthen the network structure    and improve the classification accuracy. Compared with traditional    methods, our model does not require manual feature extraction, and can    accurately identify phishing emails and insider threats. Finally, our    proposed social engineering simulation platform verifies the    effectiveness of the two-layer model. The experimental results show that    our proposed framework has the characteristics of timely detection and    after-the-fact investigation, which can effectively detect phishing    attacks and insider threats faced by enterprise systems.",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Article,English,"He, DJ (Corresponding Author), Jiangxi Univ Sci \& Technol, Ganzhou, Peoples R China.

We analysed cumulative surveillance data for children aged 6    months to 4 years who received seasonal influenza vaccine in 2015 and/or    2016 to determine: adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) rates by    vaccine brand, age and concomitant vaccine administration.    Methods: Parent/carer reports of AEFI occurring within 3 days of their    child receiving an influenza vaccine in sentinel immunisation clinics    were solicited by Short Message Service (SMS) and/or email based survey.    Retrospective data from 2 years were combined to examine specific AEFI    rates, particularly fever and medical attendance as a proxy for serious    adverse events (SAE), with and without concomitant vaccine    administration. As trivalent influenza vaccines (TIV) were funded in    Australia's National Immunisation Program (NIP) in 2015 and quadrivalent    (QIV) in 2016, respectively, we compared their safety profiles.    Results: 7402 children were included. Data were reported weekly through    each vaccination season; no safety signals or excess of adverse events    were detected. More children who received a concomitant vaccine had    fever (7.5\% versus 2.8\%; p <.001). Meningococcal B vaccine was    associated with the highest increase in AEFI rates among children    receiving a specified concomitant vaccine: 30.3\% reported an AEFI    compared with 7.3\% who received an influenza vaccine alone (p <.001).    Reported fever was strongly associated with medical attendance (OR:    42.6; 95\% Confidence Interval (CI): 25.6-71.0). TIV and QIV safety    profiles included low and expected AEFI rates (fever: 4.3\% for TIV    compared with 3.2\% for QIV (p =.015); injection site reaction: 1.9\%    for TIV compared with 3.0\% for QIV (p <.001)). There was no difference    in safety profile between brands.    Discussion: Active participant-reported data provided timely vaccine    brand-specific safety information. Our surveillance system has    particular utility in monitoring the safety of influenza vaccines, given    that they may vary in composition annually. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It was sent    to all EUA members via email during December 2019. Participation was    voluntary and questions included participants' demographics such as age,    gender, years of experience, level of training and type of practice.    Other questions assessed some domains such as whether the participant    had radiation safety courses, and the extent to which she/he is adopting    these measures during daily practice.ResultsA total of 142 Egyptian    urology trainees and urologists responded to this electronic survey. The    mean hours of fluoroscopy-guided endourologic procedures per week were    4.32.1 h, and only 23\% reported that they always wear protective lead    aprons. In terms of the thyroid shield, X-ray protective gloves, eye    googles, a total of 70\% and 89\% and 89\% reported that they never wore    it, respectively. The ALARA principle was known by only 24\% of    respondents. About 94\% denied receiving any radiation safety courses.    Participants who received radiation safety course reported significantly    shorter FT during URS (p=0.04), PCNL (p=0.03) and JJ insertion (p=0.04)    and were significantly more compliant (p=0.02). In addition, the number    of years of experience (<5y,5-10y,10-15y,>15y) and the current job level    (resident, specialist, consultant, professor) was significantly    associated with higher compliance with lead aprons (p=0.006, p<0.001,    respectively).

"Wang, Chih-Chien and Chen, Sheng-Yi",Using header session messages to anti-spamming,COMPUTERS \& SECURITY,2007,26,5,381-390,AUG,"The Internet is popular, with email use functioning as the major    Internet activity. However, spam has recently become a major problem    impeding the use of email. Many spam filtering techniques have been    implemented so far. Most current anti-spamming techniques filter out    junk emails based on email subjects and body messages. Nevertheless,    subjects and email contents are not the only cues for judging spam. This    investigation presents a statistical analysis of the header session    messages of junk and normal emails, and explores the possibility of    utilizing these messages to perform spam filtering. The message head    session, including the sender's mail address, receiver's mail address    and time, which is of little interest to most users, also provides    further information for anti-spamming purpose. A statistical analysis is    undertaken on the content of 10,024 junk emails collected from a Spam    Archive database, and 599 regular emails in company with 635 solicited    listserv or commercial emails contributed by volunteers. Content    analysis results demonstrate that up to 92.5\% of junk emails are    filtered out when utilizing the message-ID, mail user agent, and sender    and receiver addresses in the header session as cues. Additionally, the    proposed approach may induce a low block error rate for normal emails    for the sample utilized in this investigation. This low rate of    over-block errors is a significant merit of the proposed anti-spamming    approach. The proposed approach of utilizing header session messages to    filter out junk emails may coexist with other anti-spamming approaches.    Therefore, no conflict arises between the proposed approach and existing    spam prevention approaches. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

IEEE,Privacy Token Technique for Protecting User's Attributes in a Federated    Identity Management System for the Cloud Environment,,2019,,,270-279,,"Once an individual employs the use of the Internet for accessing    information; carrying out transactions and sharing of data on the Cloud,    they are connected to diverse computers on the network. As such,    security of such transmitted data is most threatened and then    potentially creating privacy risks of users on the federated identity    management system in the Cloud. Usually, User's attributes or Personal    Identifiable Information (PII) are needed to access Services on the    Cloud from different Service Providers (SPs). Sometime these SPs may by    themselves violate user's privacy by the reuse of user's attributes    offered them for the release of services to the users without their    consent and then carrying out activities that may appear malicious and    then causing damage to the users. Similarly, it should be noted that    sensitive user's attributes (e.g. first name, email, address and the    likes) are received in their original form by needed SPs in plaintext.    As a result of these problems, user's privacy is being violated. Since    these SPs may reuse them or connive with other SPs to expose a user's    identity in the cloud environment. This research is motivated to provide    a protective and novel approach that shall no longer release original    user's attributes to SPs but pseudonyms that shall prevent the SPs from    violating user's privacy through connivance to expose the user's    identity or other means. The paper introduces a conceptual framework for    the proposed user's attributes privacy protection in a federated    identity management system for the cloud. On the proposed system, the    use of pseudonymous technique also called Privacy Token (PT) is    employed. The pseudonymous technique ensures users' original attributes    values are not sent directly to the SP but auto generated pseudo    attributes values. The PT is composed of: Pseudo Attribute values,    Timestamp and SP\_ID. These composition of the PT makes it difficult for    the User's PII to be revealed and further preventing the SPs from being    able to keep them or reuse them in the future without the user's consent    for any purpose. Another important feature of the PT is its ability to    forestall collusion among several collaborating service providers. This    is due to the fact that each SP receives pseudo values that have no    direct link to the identity of the user. The prototype was implemented    with Java programming language and its performance tested on    CloudAnalyst simulation.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Abur, MM (Corresponding Author), Ahmadu Bello Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Zaria, Nigeria.

IEEE Computer Society,A safety-oriented platform for Web applications,,2006,,,350+,,"The Web browser has become the dominant interface to a broad range of    applications, including online banking, Web-based email, digital media    delivery, gaming, and ecommerce services. Early Web browsers provided    simple access to static hypertext documents. In contrast, modem browsers    serve as de facto operating systems that must manage dynamic and    potentially malicious applications. Unfortunately, browsers have not    properly adapted to their new role. As a consequence, they fail to    provide adequate isolation across applications, exposing both users and    Web services to attack.    This paper describes the architecture and implementation of the Tahoma    Web browsing system. Key to Tahoma is the browser operating system    (BOS), a new trusted software layer on which Web browsers execute. The    benefits of this architecture are threefold. First, the BOS runs the    client-side component of each Web application (e.g., on-line banking,    Web mail) in its own virtual machine. This provides strong isolation    between Web services and the user's local resources. Second, Tahoma lets    Web publishers limit the scope of their Web applications by specifying    which URLs and other resources their browsers are allowed to access.    This limits the harm that can be caused by a compromised browser Third,    Tahoma treats Web applications as first-class objects that users    explicitly install and manage, giving them explicit knowledge about and    control over downloaded content and code.    We have implemented a prototype of Tahoma using Linux and the Xen    virtual machine monitor Our security evaluation shows that Tahoma can    prevent or contain 87\% of the vulnerabilities that have been identified    in the widely used Mozilla browser In addition, our measurements of    latency, throughput, and responsiveness demonstrate that users need not    sacrifice performance for the benefits of stronger isolation and safety.",IEEE COMPUTER SOC,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Cox, RS (Corresponding Author), Univ Washington, Dept Comp Sci \& Engn, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.

Although security    technologies have improved significantly in recent years, spear phishing    continues to be successful due to the bespoke nature of such attacks.    Crafting such emails requires attackers to conduct careful research    about their victims and collect personal information about them and    their acquaintances. Despite the widespread nature of spear-phishing    attacks, little is understood about the human factors behind them. This    is particularly the case when considering the role of attack    personalization on end-user vulnerability. To study spear-phishing    attacks in the laboratory, we developed a simulation environment called    SpearSim that simulates the tasks involved in the generation and    reception of spear-phishing messages. Using SpearSim, we conducted a    laboratory experiment with human subjects to study the effect of    information availability and information exploitation end-user    vulnerability. The results of the experiment show that end-users in the    high informationavailability condition were 2.97 times more vulnerable    to spear-phishing attacks than those in the low information-availability    condition.

However, existing identity    authentication systems face multiple challenges in trans-border    contexts. Firstly, the transnational transfer of identity data struggles    to meet the varying data-compliance requirements across different    jurisdictions. Secondly, centralized authentication architectures    exhibit vulnerabilities in trust chains, where single points of failure    may lead to systemic risks. Thirdly, the inefficiency of certificate    verification in traditional Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) systems    fails to meet the real-time response demands of globalized business    operations. These limitations severely constrain real-time identity    verification in international business scenarios. To address these    issues, this study proposes a trans-border distributed certificate-free    identity authentication framework (STALE). The methodology adopts three    key innovations. Firstly, it utilizes email addresses as unique user    identifiers combined with a Certificateless Public Key Cryptography    (CL-PKC) system for key distribution, eliminating both single-point    dependency on traditional Certificate Authorities (CAs) and the key    escrow issues inherent in Identity-Based Cryptography (IBC). Secondly,    an enhanced Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key-exchange protocol    is introduced, employing forward-secure session key negotiation to    significantly improve communication security in trans-border network    environments. Finally, a distributed identity ledger is implemented,    using the FISCO BCOS blockchain, enabling decentralized storage and    verification of identity information while ensuring data immutability,    full traceability, and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)    compliance.

The paper first develops a closed-form mathematical model for    ubiquitous uplink positioning using a single light-emitting diode with    the trilateration algorithm, considering the field-of-view constraints    due to the user's optical transmitter and access point receivers. SVD in    MIMO VLC is subsequently introduced to exploit the acquired user's    location to form a pair of public and private keys for secure data    transfer over the physical medium. The proposed system performance is    evaluated in terms of the root mean square positioning error epsilon(X    )and the achieved bit error rate (BER) for the uplink positioning and    the downlink data transmission, respectively. Results show that the    effective area of the photodiode significantly impacts epsilon(X ), with    smaller areas resulting in higher epsilon(X ). It is also observed that    the epsilon(X )directly relates to the strength of ambient light    inducing noise in the system. However, the proposed uplink positioning    is less prone to natural ambient light as compared to the traditional    downlink visible light positioning. The BER analysis of the downlink    data transmission shows that the proposed SVD-based PLS enhances the    system's confidentiality by significantly narrowing the communication    zone area by over 90\% in comparison to the zero-forcing beamforming    scheme and achieves reasonable secrecy capacity.",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Article,English,"Zia-Ul-Mustafa, R (Corresponding Author), Northumbria Univ, Fac Engn \& Environm, Dept Math Phys \& Elect Engn, Opt Commun Res Grp, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Northumberland, England.

We introduce a new    anti-phishing filter, phishwish, that has a number of advantages over    existing phishing filters: it does not need to be trained, as is the    case with Bayesian filters, nor does it consult centralized white or    blacklists to determine whether an email is suspect. Phishwish uses a    set of only 11 rules to determine the veracity of an incoming email; the    results can be used to quarantine the email or to alert the user. We    compare the performance of phishwish to SpamAssassin, a popular open    source filter, as well as the Google phishing filters accessed from the    Firefox browser. Our results indicate that phishwish outperforms    existing filters in identifying phishing emails, even identifying those    originated by the `rock phish' gang, and that it aids in detection of    zero-day attacks that were not caught by existing filters.

Participants were recruited through email and represented geographically    diverse academic and non-academic settings. The interview included    questions on culture of reporting and learning from diagnostic errors;    data gathering and analysis activities; diagnostic training and    educational activities; and engagement of clinical leadership, staff,    patients, and families in diagnostic safety activities. We conducted an    inductive content analysis of interview transcripts and two reviewers    coded all data. Results Of 32 participants, 12 reported having a    specific program to address diagnostic errors. Multiple barriers to    implement diagnostic safety activities emerged: serious concerns about    psychological safety associated with diagnostic error; lack of    infrastructure for measurement, monitoring, and improvement activities    related to diagnosis; lack of leadership investment, which was often    diverted to competing priorities related to publicly reported measures    or other incentives; and lack of dedicated teams to work on diagnostic    safety. Participants provided several strategies to overcome barriers    including adapting trigger tools to identify safety events, engaging    patients in diagnostic safety, and appointing dedicated diagnostic    safety champions. Conclusions Several foundational building blocks    related to learning health systems could inform organizational efforts    to reduce diagnostic error. Promoting an organizational culture specific    to diagnostic safety, using science and informatics to improve    measurement and analysis, leadership incentives to build institutional    capacity to address diagnostic errors, and patient engagement in    diagnostic safety activities can enable progress.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Article,English,"Giardina, TD (Corresponding Author), Michael E DeBakey Vet Affairs Med Ctr MEDVAMC, Ctr Innovat Qual Effectiveness \& Safety IQuESt 15, Houston, TX 77030 USA.

ACM,A Pilot Study of Cyber Security and Privacy Related Behavior and    Personality Traits,,2013,,,737-744,,"Recent research has begun to focus on the factors that cause people to    respond to phishing attacks as well as affect user behavior on social    networks. This study examines the correlation between the Big Five    personality traits and email phishing response. Another aspect examined    is how these factors relate to users' tendency to share information and    protect their privacy on Facebook (which is one of the most popular    social networking sites).    This research shows that when using a prize phishing email, neuroticism    is the factor most correlated to responding to this email, in addition    to a gender-based difference in the response. This study also found that    people who score high on the openness factor tend to both post more    information on Facebook as well as have less strict privacy settings,    which may cause them to be susceptible to privacy attacks. In addition,    this work detected no correlation between the participants estimate of    being vulnerable to phishing attacks and actually being phished, which    suggests susceptibility to phishing is not due to lack of awareness of    the phishing risks and that real-time response to phishing is hard to    predict in advance by online users.

Although post-program evaluations of program    content were conducted at the time of program delivery, little is known    about translation of these learned skills into clinical practice.    Objective This research sought to describe levels of self-reported    participant confidence in anticoagulation management; development,    implementation, and performance management of both core and supplemental    activities of anticoagulation clinics or services; and current    anticoagulation clinical practices subsequent to participating in the    Anticoagulation Training Program. Setting A federal Indian Health    Service healthcare facility in Oklahoma, USA. Methods A cross-sectional,    electronic mail survey was designed, pretested, and administered to 267    eligible Anticoagulation Training Program participants from 1999 to    2009. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and interpreted to    identify areas of strength and opportunities for improvement. Main    outcome measures Information about confidence in anticoagulation    management skills; development, implementation and improvement of both    core and supplemental activities of anticoagulation clinics or services;    and current anticoagulation clinical practices was collected. Results    After training, over 90 \% of participants reported agreement/strong    agreement with statements about confidence in performing patient-care    related anticoagulation activities. A smaller proportion (83.3-85.4 \%)    reported agreement/strong agreement with confidence in measuring,    analyzing and reporting anticoagulation outcomes. Improvement activities    were more common than development or implementation activities (65.4,    31.9 and 35.1 \%, respectively). Not having well established    reimbursement procedures, lack of dedicated clinic space, and lack of    dedicated personnel salaries (47.3, 38.3 and 32.6 \%, respectively) were    reported as the most common barriers to developing, implementing or    improving an anticoagulation clinic. Participants indicated that    anticoagulation outcomes tracking was the most common supplemental    development, implementation and improvement activity (37.9, 37.0 and    43.8 \% respectively). Benchmarking was the least commonly reported    outcomes-related activity by participants (33.6 \%). Although there was    only a modest gain in the number of established anticoagulation clinics    after attending the Anticoagulation Training Program, approximately 21    \% of participants reported using skills learned to establish other    disease state management clinics. Conclusion In general, a majority of    participants reported high levels of confidence related to direct    patient care activities after attending the Anticoagulation Training    Program. However there is a need to raise confidence in performance    improvement and outcomes management activities to align with current    accreditation standards in anticoagulation management as the    Anticoagulation Training Program evolves.",SPRINGER,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Schupbach, RR (Corresponding Author), Claremore Comprehens Hlth Care Facil, 101 South Moore Ave, Claremore, OK 74017 USA.

IEEE,Investigating the Fractal Nature of Individual User Netflow Data,,2014,,,,,"Modeling and characterizing Internet traffic has been a widely studied    problem since the conception of the Internet. The self-similar, bursty    nature of the traffic has led to a number of conventional statistical    models that unfortunately provide relatively weak modeling power.    Recently, fractal analysis techniques have emerged to better    characterize and model Internet traffic data. However, past research    studies have focused on describing and quantifying the fractal nature of    Internet traffic on user groups, instead of a single user. In this paper    the authors investigate the issue of individual users exhibiting fractal    (self-similar behavior) behavior across multiple application types.    Using real Internet traffic traces (collected via Net-Flow logs)    collected at a college campus for 30 days, our investigations reveal    that in a number of application categories (http, chatting, p2p, email    etc.) at least one user exhibits long-range correlations typical of    fractal behavior. Of the 10 application groups, 7 had over 80\% of users    demonstrating self-similar behavior with 3 of those groups having >    98\%.

As IoT    platforms that allows users to manage and control these IoT devices    become more prevalent, the security of IoT platforms has come under    increasing scrutiny. Cryptographic authentication (CA) has long been    central to authentication but poses significant security risks, such as    account takeovers due to credential disclosure. Unfortunately, CA    remains the most popular authentication scheme for IoT platforms, making    them vulnerable to phishing attacks. Current enhancement methods,    including challenge-response protocols and multifactor authentication,    are still susceptible to phishing and face usability issues,    particularly in cross-domain collaboration systems where seamless access    is crucial. This article introduces Context-Auth, a context-aware    authentication scheme designed to defend against phishing attacks    without requiring tamper-resistant hardware.

Information is the key to    patient empowerment. Without information, children and families cannot    engage in meaningful discussions or make thoughtful decisions regarding    medical care. Information sharing is a model for patient interaction    with the health care system that may significantly improve the care of    children and families. This article focuses on information technologies    that utilize user-centered design principles and interactive    capabilities to facilitate information sharing and to empower children    and families. Examples include electronic pediatric personal medical    records, customized health information systems, and interactive    physician offices with electronic mail (e-mail) and telemedicine    capabilities. Ideally, these systems would all be integrated. Successful    implementation of new technologies will require thoughtful attention and    balanced solutions to tensions between information sharing vs security,    and curatorship vs censorship. Issues related to access and the digital    divide must also be addressed. Acceptance and usability of new    technologies is predicated on close collaboration among physicians,    researchers in informatics, librarians, educators, and other    professionals with expertise in the human-computer interface.

Regular home users are left without protection    against phishing, other than the traditional rudimentary email    filtering. Furthermore, security toolbars on browsers have been shown to    be not effective. In this paper, we propose a light-weight user    whitelist technique to provide protection for home users.

"Ferreira, Ana and Teles, Soraia",Persuasion: How phishing emails can influence users and bypass security    measures,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES,2019,125,,19-31,MAY,"Phishing is a very dangerous form of social engineering with the aim to    deceive people into disclosing private/confidential information. Despite    widespread warnings and means to educate users to identify phishing    messages, these are still a prevalent practice and a lucrative business.    The authors believe that persuasion, as a style of human communication    designed to influence others, has a central role in successful digital    scams. Research on persuasion applied to phishing emails is scarce and    tends to build on Cialdini's work alone. Only a single study has    proposed a list of merged principles from three different perspectives    but it has methodological limitations regarding the analysis'    performance by a single researcher and the testing of principles in a    small, not validated sample of phishing emails. This paper aims to fill    those gaps by building on Cialdini's, Gragg's and Stajano \& Wilson's    works to derive a unique list of Principles of Persuasion in Social    Engineering (PPSE), resulting from the application of the relational    method by two independent researchers. The PPSE are identified, by two    independent researchers (Kappa > 0.789) on a sample of phishing email    subject lines (N = 194), dated from 2008 to 2017 and randomly selected    from a reliable phishing archive (millersmiles.co.uk ). A thematic    content analysis, together with the sample characterization in terms of    visual elements and targeted content, revealed that the most prominent    principles of persuasion in phishing emails were `Authority', `Strong    Affect', `Integrity' and `Reciprocation'. The larger percentage of    references with the presence of visual elements was found for the    `Strong Affect' principle. The use of the pronouns `you' and `your' was    more evident for the categories `Strong Affect' and `Authority', while    the employment of the pronouns `we, us, our' was more frequent in the    `Reciprocation' principle.

USENIX Assoc,SoK: Still Plenty of Phish in the Sea - A Taxonomy of User-Oriented    Phishing Interventions and Avenues for Future Research,,2021,,BS2AZ,339-357,,"Phishing is a prevalent cyber threat, targeting individuals and    organizations alike. Previous approaches on anti-phishing measures have    started to recognize the role of the user, who, at the center of the    target, builds the last line of defense. However, user-oriented phishing    interventions are fragmented across a diverse research landscape, which    has not been systematized to date. This makes it challenging to gain an    overview of the various approaches taken by prior works.    In this paper, we present a taxonomy of phishing interventions based on    a systematic literature analysis. We shed light on the diversity of    existing approaches by analyzing them with respect to the intervention    type, the addressed phishing attack vector, the time at which the    intervention takes place, and the required user interaction.    Furthermore, we highlight shortcomings and challenges emerging from both    our literature sample and prior meta-analyses, and discuss them in the    light of current movements in the field of usable security.

This project report outlines    the development and evaluation of a Chrome browser extension tailored to    bolster email security, specifically focusing on detecting and    mitigating phishing attempts in financial communications. The study    begins with a thorough examination of the techniques and tactics used by    phishing attackers in financial email campaigns. A sophisticated    awareness of the changing landscape of phishing assaults is required to    develop successful defences. The key contribution of this work is the    development of a powerful Chrome browser extension that easily    integrates with common email services in the financial sector. This    extension harnesses a blend of machine learning algorithms, URL    analysis, and user-friendly interfaces to identify potentially malicious    financial emails. It rigorously scans email content, scrutinizing    hyperlinks and attachments for signs of phishing. The extension    evaluates URL reputations, checks for typical phishing indicators, and    examines email headers. In case any suspicious elements are identified,    users receive real-time alerts, enabling them to make informed decisions    about the safety of financial emails. To ensure the extension's accuracy    and effectiveness within the financial context, an extensive dataset of    real-world phishing emails and legitimate financial messages is employed    for training and testing. The report offers a comprehensive analysis of    the extension's performance, emphasizing its capability to detect and    prevent phishing attempts in financial emails while minimizing false    positives. In addition to its detection capabilities, the extension    actively promotes user awareness and education regarding phishing    threats within the financial sector. It provides guidance on recognizing    phishing red flags and offers educational resources to enhance user    security practices. This work concludes with an evaluation of the    extension's usability and its potential impact on enhancing email    security within the financial domain.

The purpose of this    study is to characterize these perceptions with respect to frequency and    importance.    Methods: The study is a cross sectional survey of physician members of    the Society of Critical Care Medicine who report caring for critically    ill children. Perceived frequency and importance of risks to patient    safety across 11 domains in the pediatric ICU was obtained through a    validated survey. Mean problem score was tested for trend across    frequency categories.    Results: 140 responses were obtained from 199 opened email invitations    (73\%) and 822 total emails (17\%). The survey was internally valid with    a Cronbach alpha value of 0.87. The most frequent risks to patient    safety occurred in areas of ineffective communication, inadequate    training and orientation, and poor hand hygiene. The most problematic    risk domains were ineffective communication, healthcare acquired    infections, inadequate training and orientation, and medication error.    For most risk categories, as the perceived risk frequency increased, the    mean perceived problem score of that risk decreased, excepting hand    hygiene (p = 0.96) and central line infections (p = 0.27).    Conclusions: Risks related to communication, training and orientation,    and hand hygiene are perceived as frequent. Risks related to    communication, healthcare acquired infections, training and orientation,    and medication errors are perceived as the most important. Variance in    attitude toward these risks is significant for most domains.    Understanding variance will be important in changing human behavior    related to risk in the PICU.

IEEE,Confront Phishing Attacks - from a Perspective of Security Education,,2019,,,10-13,,"Recently, targeted attacks are drastically increasing in both indivduals    and companies. For technical countermeasure against such a targeted    attack, various methods such as email/web contents analysis etc., are    developed and realized. However, as it is often said, attackers    precisely exploit the most vulnerable part in order to achieve their    goals.    Therefore, spear phishing against human user is employed for such    attacks in a large propotion. Moreover, in order to increase success    probability of such attacks, attackers often adopt social engineering    technique.    In this paper, we present a current effort of our research group on    combating targeted attacks employing spear phishing with using social    engineering, through user education.    Specifically, at first we present relationship between human    psychological characteristics and vulnerability against social    engineering. The result can be used for testing whether a user has    vulnerability on some social engineering technique, and the testing    result can be utilized for countermeasure or user's training.

In encrypted email systems, an email    user not only needs to search on encrypted emails received from other    users, but also needs to search on encrypted emails sent to other users.    Motivated by this, the paper proposes a cryptographic method to allow    these two types of user (i.e., senders and receivers) to search on    encrypted keywords, which is called Public-key Encryption with    Bidirectional Keyword Search (PEBKS). We give formal definitions of a    PEBKS scheme and its indistinguishable security model to capture the    scenario that no adversary can efficiently distinguish two ciphertexts    of keywords from each other, even if the adversary can adaptively obtain    search trapdoors of many keywords. Specifically, we propose a concrete    PEBKS scheme, whose security relies on a standard hard problem, i.e.,    bilinear Diffie-Hellman problem, in the random oracle model.

The Impacts of Explanations for Machine Learning Models on    Human Decision-Making in Spam Detection,,2021,12797,,269-284,,"The impact of machine learning (ML) explanations and different    attributes of explanations on human performance was investigated in a    simulated spam detection task. Participants decided whether the metadata    presented about an email indicated that it was spam or benign. The task    was completed with the aid of a ML model. The ML model's prediction was    displayed on every trial. The inclusion of an explanation and, if an    explanation was presented, attributes of the explanation were    manipulated within subjects: the number of model input features (3, 7)    and visualization of feature importance values (graph, table), as was    trial type (i.e., hit, false alarm). Overall model accuracy (50\% vs    88\%) was manipulated between subjects, and user trust in the model was    measured as an individual difference metric. Results suggest that a    user's trust in the model had the largest impact on the decision    process. The users showed better performance with a more accurate model,    but no differences in accuracy based on number of input features or    visualization condition. Rather, users were more likely to detect false    alarms made by the more accurate model; they were also more likely to    comply with a model ``miss{''} when more model explanation was provided.    Finally, response times were longer in individuals reporting low model    trust, especially when they did not comply with the model's prediction.

Therefore, we designed a pilot study to assess the    capability of a regional health care information platform to actively    monitor the safety of a newly licensed vaccine.    Objective: This study aimed to conduct active surveillance of human    papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine safety based on this information platform.    Methods: In 2017, one of China's most mature information platforms with    superior data linkage was selected. A structured questionnaire and    open-ended interview guidelines were developed to investigate the    feasibility of active surveillance following HPV vaccination using the    regional health care information platform in Ningbo. The questionnaire    was sent to participants via email, and a face-to-face interview was    conducted to confirm details or resolve discrepancies.    Results: Five databases that could be considered essential to active    surveillance of vaccine safety were integrated into the platform    starting in 2015. Except for residents' health records, which had a    coverage rate of 87\%, the data sources covered more than 95\% of the    records that were documented in Ningbo. All the data could be inherently    linked using the national identity card. There were 19,328 women who    received the HPV vaccine, and 37,988 doses were administered in 2017 and    2018. Women aged 30-40 years accounted for the largest proportion.    Quadrivalent vaccination accounted for 73.1\% of total vaccination, a    much higher proportion than that of bivalent vaccination. Of the first    doses, 60 (60/19,328, 0.31\%) occurred outside Ningbo. There were no    missing data for vaccination-relevant variables, such as identity card,    vaccine name, vaccination doses, vaccination date, and manufacturer.    ICD-10 coding could be used to identify 9,180 cases using a predefined    list of the outcomes of interest, and 1.88\% of these cases were missing    the identity card. During the 90 days following HPV vaccination, 4    incident cases were found through the linked vaccination history and    electronic medical records. The combined incident rate of rheumatoid    arthritis, optic neuritis, and Henoch-Schonlein purpura was 8.84/100,000    doses of bivalent HPV, and the incidence rate of rheumatoid arthritis    was 3.75/100,000 doses of quadrivalent HPV.    Conclusions: This study presents an available approach to initiate an    active surveillance system for adverse events following HPV vaccination,    based on a regional health care information platform in China An    extended observation period or the inclusion of additional functional    sites is warranted to conduct future hypothesis-generating and    hypothesis-confirming studies for vaccine safety concerns.","JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC","130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",Article,English,"Zhan, SY (Corresponding Author), Peking Univ, Dept Epidemiol \& Biostat, Hlth Sci Ctr, 38 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.

Since    technical measures currently fall short of preventing phishing attacks    completely, educating end-users is an important factor in reducing the    risk of successful attacks. Here, game-based learning has emerged as a    scalable, motivational educational approach. While learning games that    focus on phishing emails have been created in the past, they mainly    include simple game mechanics, which do not map to the complex decisions    that are involved in recognizing malicious emails. To this end, we    present a novel anti-phishing learning game, consisting of two different    game modes: Either, players have to create phishing emails from given    templates themselves, or they have to analyze emails for malicious cues    and mark relevant parts. The game is designed for a broad target group    of adult users with little to no prior knowledge about phishing. To    facilitate immersion, the game content is generated automatically and    allows for personalization.

Traditionally, achievable secrecy    rate of this model is achieved by combining Marton's coding scheme for    the two-user broadcast channel (BC) and the secret-key based feedback    scheme, where both of the two feedback links are used to transmit secret    keys shared between the transceivers. Recently, it has been shown that    for the Gaussian wiretap channel with feedback, the Schalkwijk-Kailath    (SK) feedback scheme achieves its secrecy capacity. Then it is natural    to ask: can we do better when applying the SK-type scheme to the    GBC-WTC-CM-F? In this paper, we answer this question by proposing two    kinds of SK-type schemes. Specifically, first, we propose a hybrid    scheme where one feedback link is used to transmit a secret key, and the    other one is used for SK-type coding. We show that this hybrid scheme    may perform better than the existing one in some cases. Next, we show    that Ozarow's extended SK scheme for the two-user Gaussian BC with    feedback, where both feedback links are used for SK-type coding, is    self-secure (satisfying perfect weak secrecy constraint by itself) and    may perform the best. We further show that Ozarow's scheme is in fact a    secure finite blocklength coding scheme, and extend it to the static    fading SISO and SIMO cases.

It negatively affects    the joy of or motivation toward using digital content, and often causes    various problems related to content use when user's awareness declines    due to the lack of sensory reality. For example, while we can    conveniently send an email with a single click with today's email    clients, we often experience email issues such as sending one to an    unintended recipient due to mistouching or using a wrong address. This    is caused by `sending an email' with a single click, which deprives the    user of the sensory reality of the operation. This study focuses on the    email client interface and aims to represent the sensation of mailing a    letter by integrating the pressing gesture operation. In this paper, we    propose an email client interaction (MCI) system which realizes physical    movements of `sending a mail/holding out a letter' by the 3-dimensional,    pressure-sensitive functionality (3D Touch). We also design an email    interface to be operated only by gestures, featuring a 4-direction    display interface, and devise a mechanism to detect / notify mistakes in    the email content, using the function to give feedbacks of different    pressure intensities. The study emphasizes the sensory reality of    emailing tasks by integrating above functions and proposes a method to    prevent email mistakes by improving users' awareness while emailing.

Within    zero-trust architecture, the continuous authentication (CA) strategy has    been proposed to counter the network security threats posed by    traditional static authentication mechanisms. However, most studies have    focused on either device-to-device authentication or user    authentication. This limitation results in risks of identity spoofing or    credential theft despite the implementation of the CA mechanism, thus    concluding the parity in significance between authenticating users and    devices. Furthermore, considering the CA of users, it is essential to    face the issue posed by user authentication fatigue. In response to    these challenges, this work aims to introduce an unconsciously CA    protocol (UCAP) based on zero-trust concepts and behavior biometrics.    UCAP utilizes the behavior of keystroke dynamics as a main factor in    consistently evaluating the user trust level. This method enables the    continual updating of communication keys to preserve robust    authentication of both devices and users.

IEEE,Application- and User-sensitive Privacy Enforcement in Mobile Systems,,2015,,,162-163,,"The mobile era is marked by exciting opportunities for utilization of    contextual information in computing. Applications from different    categories-including commercial and enterprise email, instant messaging,    social, banking, insurance and retail-access, process and transmit over    the network numerous pieces of sensitive information, such as the user's    geographical location, device ID, contacts, calendar events, passwords,    and health records, as well as credit-card, social-security, and    bank-account numbers.    Understanding and managing how an application handles private data is a    significant challenge. There are not only multiple sources of such data    (including primarily social accounts, user inputs and platform    libraries), but also different release targets (such as advertising    companies and application servers) and different forms of release (for    example, passwords transmitted in the clear, hashed or encrypted). To    the end users, and particularly those who are not tech savvy, it is    nontrivial to manage these complexities.    In response, we have designed Labyrinth, a system for privacy    enforcement. The unique features of Labyrinth are (i) an intuitive    visual interface for configuration of the privacy policy, which consists    of enriched app screen captures annotated with privacy-related    information; combined with (ii) a lightweight mechanism to detect and    suppress privacy threats that is completely decoupled from the host    platform.

ACM,Multi-Account Dashboard for Authentication Dependency Analysis,,2022,,39,,,"User authentication is necessary for the majority of online services. If    users fail to authenticate due to the loss of an authentication factor,    fallback processes allow users to regain access to their accounts.    However, most of the proposed and deployed fallback methods have    substantial weaknesses that degrade security, e.g., guessable security    questions. This is even more serious since through account dependencies    (e.g., password reset via email), additional accounts can be    compromised. On the other hand, misconfiguration of (fallback)    authentication might result in locking a user out of an account.    To help users to analyze their account security and accessibility risk,    we present the multi-account dashboard (MAD). The MAD evaluates account    types, applied primary and fallback authentication methods as well as    the formed account network. By analyzing dependencies and transitive    risks, weak links are discovered and indicated, and improvements are    suggested. We further propose a service authentication description to    collect the required information in an transparent way. The MAD is    implemented as a plugin of the password manager KeePass.

As both    populations increased over time, contact and conflict with one another    became inevitable. Although human-alligator conflicts have been well    documented, there has been no detailed classification of risk factors    associated with human activities immediately preceding, and in most    cases precipitating, an encounter. Herein, we provide a ranking system    to categorize different human activities, based on risk levels,    immediately preceding an encounter with an alligator. To complete our    review in 2021, we initially gleaned data regarding alligator attacks on    humans from the CrocBITE website between the years 1734 and 2021. We    augmented the details of each incident with additional information    obtained by an internet search (e.g., Google) and then cross-referenced    all information with existing literature (e.g., books detailing specific    human-alligator interactions) and by communicating via email and/ or    telephone with state fish and wildlife agencies. Our ranking system    indicated that 96\% (26\% low risk, 48\% moderate risk, 22\% high risk)    of the recorded human-alligator incidents reviewed were caused by some    level of human inattention in the form of risky behaviors, often while    participating in recreational water activities. These results highlight    the need for increased and targeted public education concerning safe and    responsible human activities in areas inhabited by alligators.

"Greiman, Virginia and Bain, Christina",The Emergence of Cyber Activity as a Gateway to Human Trafficking,,2013,,,90-96,,"Human trafficking is a worldwide crisis and the U. S. Department of    State's 2012 Trafficking in Persons Report highlights the critical need    to address this issue both home and abroad. Today, it is estimated as    many as 27 million people around the world are victims of trafficking    into the sex trade and other forms of servitude known as modern slavery    or trafficking in persons. ``Trafficking in persons{''} and ``human    trafficking{''} has been used by the U. S. Department of State and other    governmental and multinational organizations as umbrella terms for the    act of recruiting, harboring, transporting, providing, or obtaining a    person for compelled labor or commercial sex acts through the use of    force, fraud, or coercion. Recent research reflects that the    exploitation of people through trafficking, is being channeled heavily    through cyber activity such as Internet service, local bulletin board    service, or any device capable of electronic data storage or    transmission including social networking sites like Craig's List,    Facebook, MySpace, and email instant messaging, text messaging,    fictitious employment advertisements, immigration assistance and online    bride websites. The goals of the research include: (1) identifying some    of the key present challenges in cybertrafficking investigations, (2)    understanding the impact of cybertrafficking in our society, locally,    nationally and globally; and (3) assessing the role of the private    sector in regulating the Internet for human trafficking activity.    Presently, human trafficking scholarship and education is in its early    stages particularly as it relates to understanding victim protection and    assistance, technological, evidentiary and surveillance issues and    international legal frameworks for the prevention of human trafficking.    Greater awareness and education is needed to assist in the challenges    faced by our Executive and Legislative Branches as they address    important issues of national security and the growing incidence of    cybercrime. This paper will introduce common law legal doctrines,    procedural and evidentiary tools, forensic analysis, and case studies    that will assist in creating a deeper understanding of the impact of    cyber activity on the human trafficking industry in the effort to find    greater solutions for the prevention, prosecution and protection of the    innocent from the growing incidence of cyber activity as it relates to    human trafficking around the globe.",ACAD  CONFERENCES LTD,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",Proceedings Paper,English,"Greiman, V (Corresponding Author), Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.

Security and privacy are, however, the    main concerns in IoT due to the openness of communication channels and    the unattended nature of common sensors. To provide security and privacy    for sensors and users in IoT-based systems; in 2019, Zhou et al.    proposed an unlinkable authentication scheme using bilinear pairings.    However, the vulnerability of their scheme against sensor node    impersonation attack as proved in this article renders the scheme of    their work impractical and insecure. A pairing free lightweight and    unlinkable authentication scheme for distributed IoT devices    (PFLUA-DIoT) is then proposed in this article. The security of    PFLUA-DIoT is proved using the formal method along with a discussion on    its provision of security features. The performance and security    comparisons show that PFLUA-DIoT provides known security features and    provides better performance. Due to the avoidance of bilinear    pairing-based expensive operations, PFLUA-DIoT completes authentication    in less than half running time as compared with their and related    schemes.

Hospitals with L\&D units were recruited from states with    projected availability of 2018 state inpatient data in the United    States. Measures included the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire Safety    Climate Subscale and the Perinatal Missed Care Survey. We estimated the    relationship between safety climate and missed care using Kruskal-Wallis    tests and mixed-effects linear regression.ResultsThe analytic sample    included 3429 L\&D registered nurses from 253 hospitals (response rate,    35\%). A majority of respondents (65.7\%) reported a perception of good    safety climate in their units, with a mean score of 4.12 (+/- 0.73) out    of 5. The mean number of aspects of care occasionally, frequently, or    always missed on respondents' units was 11.04 (+/- 6.99) out of 25.    chi(2) Tests showed that six mostly commonly missed aspects of care    (e.g., timely documentation) and three reasons for missed care    (communications, material resources, and labor resources) were    associated with safety climate groups (P < 0.001). The adjusted    mixed-effects model identified a significant association between better    nurse-perceived safety climate and less missed care (beta = -2.65; 95\%    confidence interval, -2.97 to -2.34; P < 0.001) after controlling for    years of experience and highest nursing education.ConclusionsOur    findings suggest that improving safety climate-for example, through    better teamwork and communication-may improve nursing care quality    during labor and birth through decreasing missed nursing care.    Conversely, it is also possible that strategies to reduce missed    care-such as staffing improvements-may improve safety climate.",LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS \& WILKINS,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",Article,English,"Lyndon, A (Corresponding Author), NYU, Rory Meyers Coll Nursing, 433 First Ave, New York, NY 10010 USA.

IEEE,Enhancing the Naive Bayes Spam Filter through Intelligent Text    Modification Detection,,2018,,,849-854,,"Spam emails have been a chronic issue in computer security. They are    very costly economically and extremely dangerous for computers and    networks. Despite of the emergence of social networks and other Internet    based information exchange venues, dependence on email communication has    increased over the years and this dependence has resulted in an urgent    need to improve spam filters. Although many spam filters have been    created to help prevent these spam emails from entering a user's inbox,    there is a lack or research focusing on text modifications. Currently,    Naive Bayes is one of the most popular methods of spam classification    because of its simplicity and efficiency. Naive Bayes is also very    accurate; however, it is unable to correctly classify emails when they    contain leetspeak or diacritics. Thus, in this proposes, we implemented    a novel algorithm for enhancing the accuracy of the Naive Bayes Spam    Filter so that it can detect text modifications and correctly classify    the email as spam or ham. Our Python algorithm combines semantic based,    keyword based, and machine learning algorithms to increase the accuracy    of Naive Bayes compared to Spamassassin by over two hundred percent.    Additionally, we have discovered a relationship between the length of    the email and the spam score, indicating that Bayesian Poisoning, a    controversial topic, is actually a real phenomenon and utilized by    spammers.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Huang, L (Corresponding Author), 2017 Honors Summer Math Camp, San Marcos, TX 78666 USA.

Humans    act as a weak link in cyberattacks, and as a result, organizations are    prone to phishing, business email compromise, and malware types of    cybersecurity attacks. In this study, we identify the human-centric    barriers and success factors that influence an organization's readiness    to handle cybersecurity threats. Moreover, we develop a readiness model    to help organizations assess and implement security practices for    cybersecurity from the human factor perspective. We conducted a    multivocal literature review on 120 primary studies to identify human    barriers, success factors, and best practices that positively influence    cybersecurity. The results show that researchers consider trust,    ignorance, and a lack of technological knowledge the significant    obstacles, while industry practitioners point to a lack of technological    knowledge, negligence, and impulsive or reckless behavior as the primary    barriers. On the other hand, knowledge, proactive awareness, and    cognitive ability are the most significant success factors from both    researchers' and industry practitioners' perspectives.

Finished product testing    may be considered as a control measure at the end of the production    process. However, testing gives only very limited information on the    safety status of a food. If a hazardous organism is found it means    something, but absence in a limited number of samples is no guarantee of    safety of a whole production batch. Finished product testing is often    too little and too late. Therefore most attention should be focussed on    management and control of the hazards in a more proactive way by    implementing an effective food safety management system. For    verification activities in a food safety management system, finished    product testing may however be useful. For three cases studies; canned    food, chocolate and cooked ham, the relevance of testing both of    finished products and the production environment is discussed. Since the    level of control of different processes can be largely different it is    beneficial if the frequency of sampling of finished products and    production environments would be related to the associated human health    risk, which can be assessed on the basis of risk assessment and    epidemiological data.

Modeling car-following behavior in such mixed traffic is crucial for    better understanding the differences in driving behavior between AVs and    HVs, thereby facilitating the development of AV driving strategies to    enhance traffic safety. In such mixed traffic, the car-following modes    typically include AVs following HVs, HVs following HVs and HVs following    AVs. Previous studies have compared the driving behavior of HVs    following HVs and HVs following AVs, but few have considered the driving    behavior of AVs following HVs in the comparison. To bridge this gap,    this paper first decomposes car-following events in mixed traffic    extracted from a Lyft level-5 dataset into driving primitives using the    Hidden Markov Model with Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM-HMM). Then, the    Latent Dirichlet Allocation with GMM (GMM-LDA) is introduced to cluster    the driving primitives into different car-following behavior patterns.    Based on the identified patterns, the differences across the three    car-following modes are further explored. The results show that the    driving behavior under three car-following modes differs from each    other. Specifically, compared to the HVs following HVs mode, in the AVs    following HVs mode, AVs tend to maintain car-following behavior patterns    with a longer distance gap and adopt a lower speed to ensure safety.    This study offers a comprehensive understanding of car-following    behavior in mixed traffic, which will facilitate the development of    human-like driving strategies for AVs and enhance the safety of mixed    traffic.",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Article,English,"Zou, YJ (Corresponding Author), Tongji Univ, Key Lab Rd \& Traff Engn, Minist Educ, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China.

Many scammers design a step-by-step approach to phishing in order to    gain the potential victim's trust and convince them to take the desired    actions. It is important to understand which behaviours and attitudes    can influence following the attacker in each step of a phishing scam.    This will enable us to identify the root causes of phishing and to    develop specific mitigation plans for each step of the phishing process    and to increase prevention points. This study investigates to what    extent people's risk-taking and decision-making styles influence the    likelihood of phishing victimisation in three specific phishing steps.    We asked participants to play a risk-taking game and to answer questions    related to two psychological scales to measure their behaviours, and    then conducted a simulated phishing campaign to assess their    phishability throughout the three phishing steps selected. We find that    the attitude to risk-taking and gender can predict users' phishability    in the different steps selected. There are however other possible direct    and indirect behavioural factors that could be investigated in future    studies.

This knowledge gap is especially    critical for the older adult population as new technology solutions are    increasingly embedded in clinical trials for this demographic. Our    objective was to investigate how older adults conceptualize    participation burden in contact for research participation and research    trials using technology. Methods We developed and conducted an    Internet-based survey consisting of 22 multiple choice and Likert-scale    type questions investigating older adults' preferred means and frequency    of being contacted about research opportunities, their willingness to    use specific kinds of technology and their concerns regarding technology    use in clinical trials. We received a total of 273 completed surveys    from eligible participants aged 50 or older. Results Older adults    preferred to be contacted about research opportunities monthly, over    email. Survey participants were least willing to use monitoring devices    and their biggest concern was the security of the storage of information    gathered by technology. This concern was positively correlated with age.    Participants indicated a preference to use technology daily, in short    sessions, preferably in a way that can be incorporated into their daily    routine.

RBA    monitors extra features during login and requests for an additional    authentication step if the observed feature values deviate from the    usual ones in the login history. In state-of-the-art RBA    re-authentication deployments, users receive an email with a numerical    code in its body, which must be entered on the online service. Although    this procedure has a major impact on RBA's time exposure and usability,    these aspects were not studied so far. We introduce two RBA    reauthentication variants supplementing the de facto standard with a    link-based and another code-based approach. Then, we present the results    of a between-group study (N = 592) to evaluate these three approaches.    Our observations show with significant results that there is potential    to speed up the RBA re-authentication process without reducing neither    its security properties nor its security perception. The link-based    re-authentication via ``magic links{''}, however, makes users    significantly more anxious than the code-based approaches when perceived    for the first time.

"Ferreira, Ana",Why Ransomware needs a human touch,,2018,,,237-241,,"Ransomware is currently one of the biggest threats in malware attacks.    Although the first known attack occurred in 1989, only in the last 6    years has this threat greatly increased and become more sophisticated.    The lack of adequate security measures and awareness propelled the rapid    spread and increased severity of ransomware variants (e.g., WannaCry    ransomware in 2017). Further, there is little research work on this    matter, only traditional protections are available and even    state-of-the-art mobile malware detection approaches are still    ineffective. This greatly increases the attack surface on the mobile    domain. To better understand the research work performed on this    subject, this paper presents a detailed review of the literature on    ransomware, existing mainly since 2015. Results show that most work    focus on the analysis of ransomware structures and development/testing    of detection solutions. Very few studies focus on human related    solutions or ransomware prevention. This paper also presents an analysis    of a sample of ransomware email subject lines regarding the integration    of persuasion content and targeted/personal aspects, so to identify and    understand more human aspects of the attack. In order to avoid mistakes    similar to other social engineering malware research approaches (e.g.,    email phishing and scams), which have been more comprehensively studied,    ransomware research direction must be completely reversed. It must focus    mainly on prevention and backup/restoring procedures, which are related    to socio-technical solutions that can manage and understand users'    awareness, workflow, behaviours and needs.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Ferreira, A (Corresponding Author), Univ Porto, Fac Med, CINTESIS Ctr Hlth Technol \& Serv Res, Porto, Portugal.

Few studies have analysed data from these    systems to further understand the nature or impact of unprofessional    behaviour amongst staff. Ethos is a whole-of-hospital professional    accountability programme that includes an online messaging system. Ethos    has now been implemented across multiple Australian hospitals. This    study examined reported unprofessional behaviour that staff indicated    created a risk to patient safety. This study included 1310 Ethos    submissions reporting co-worker unprofessional behaviour between 2017    and 2020 across eight Australian hospitals. Submissions that indicated    the behaviour increased the risk to patient safety were identified.    Descriptive summary statistics were presented for reporters and subjects    of submissions about unprofessional behaviour. Logistic regression was    applied to examine the association between each unprofessional behaviour    (of the six most frequently reported in the Ethos submissions) and    patient safety risk reported in the submissions. The descriptions in the    reports were reviewed and the patient safety risks were coded using a    framework aligned with the World Health Organization's International    Classification for Patient Safety. Of 1310 submissions about    unprofessional behaviour, 395 (30.2\%) indicated that there was a risk    to patient safety.

The two    main types of risks to patient safety described were related to clinical    process/procedure and clinical administration. Commonly reported events    included staff not following policy or protocol; doctors refusing to    review a patient; and interruptions and inadequate information during    handover.

"Lin, Hao and Gao, Fei and Zhang, Hua and Jin, Zhengping and Li, Wenmin    and Wen, Qiaoyan",Public Key Encryption With Equality Test Supporting Flexible Designated    Authorization in Cloud Storage,IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL,2022,16,1,1460-1470,MAR,"In cloud storage, public key encryption with equality test (PKEET) is    suitable for testing whether two ciphertexts generated from different    public keys contain the same message without decryption. Recently, (Y.    J. Wang et al., 2019) have proposed a public key signcryption scheme    with designated equality test (PKS-DET). In this scheme, since the    public key of the tester is used in the encryption, the tester needs to    use its secret key to test the ciphertexts. Without trapdoor, PKS-DET    prevents the attacker from testing the user's ciphertexts with the    stolen trapdoor. Therefore, the privacy of the user can be protected.    However, if the user in the PKS-DET wants to authorize the other tester    to test his/her ciphertexts for some reason, the message needs to be    encrypted again by the public key of the other tester. This will lead to    higher computational complexity. Hence, the PKS-DET is not flexible to    authorize multiple testers. In this article, we propose a construction    of PKEET supporting flexible designated authorization (PKEET-FDA). The    user in our PKEET-FDA can adaptively authorize multiple testers to test    his/her ciphertexts, and each authorized tester must use its secret key    to perform equality test for the ciphertexts. More importantly, the user    does not need to encrypt the message repeatedly any more. We demonstrate    the security of PKEET-FDA under two types of adversaries.

USENIX,Assessing Suspicious Emails with Banner Warnings Among Blind and    Low-Vision Users in Realistic Settings,,2024,,,2083-2100,,"Warning users about suspicious emails usually happens through visual    interventions such as banners. Evidence from laboratory experiments    shows that email banner warnings are unsuitable for blind and low-vision    (BLV) users as they tend to miss or make no use of them. However, the    laboratory settings preclude a full understanding of how BLV users would    realistically behave around these banner warnings because the    experiments don't use the individuals' own email addresses, devices, or    emails of their choice. To address this limitation, we devised a study    with n=21 BLV email users in realistic settings. Our findings indicate    that this user population misses or makes no use of Gmail and Outlook    banner warnings because these are implemented in a narrow sense, that    is, (i) they allow access to the warning text without providing context    relevant to the risk of associated email, and (ii) the formatting,    together with the possible actions, is confusing as to how a user should    deal with the email in question.

These excess    opioids increase the risks of new persistent opioid use, opioid-induced    ventilatory impairment and opioid diversion. This study tests the    effectiveness of two behavioural nudges, one based on peer behaviour and    one based on best practice guidelines, in reducing excessive    postoperative opioid prescriptions.    Methods and analysis The study will be conducted at 19 hospitals within    a large healthcare delivery system in northern California, USA. Three    surgical specialties (general surgery, orthopaedic surgery and    obstetric/gynaecological surgery) at each hospital will be randomised    either to a control group or to one of two active intervention arms. One    intervention is grounded in the theory of injunctive norms, and provides    feedback to surgeons on their postoperative opioid prescribing relative    to prescribing guidelines endorsed by their institution. The other    intervention draws from the theory of descriptive norms, and provides    feedback similar to the first intervention but using peers' behaviour    rather than guidelines as the benchmark for the surgeon's prescribing    behaviour. The interventions will be delivered by a monthly email. Both    interventions will be active for twelve months. The effects of each    intervention relative to the control group and to each other will be    tested using a four-level hierarchical model adjusted for multiple    hypothesis testing.    Ethics and dissemination Using behavioural nudges rather than rigid    policy changes allows us to target excessive prescribing without    preventing clinicians from using their clinical judgement to address    patient pain. All study activities have been approved by the RAND Human    Subjects Protection Committee (ID 2018-0988).

A user    usually needs to send an e-mail to a specific group of users via a    secure delivery mechanism. In this paper, a new e-mail delivery    mechanism using secure multicast key protocol with ID-based factorial    number structure (ID-based FNS) is proposed in an encryption multicast    system. In the e-mail delivery mechanism, the message of e-mail is    required to encrypt first before sending out in order to safeguard the    secrecy of the message on a public channel, such as wire-lined public    switching communication links and wireless communication systems.    Without loss generality, the public-key system is usually adopted in the    multicast environment for the convenience at the easy key management    need. As a manner of fact, the mechanism is having analyzed the space    occupation; our scheme outperforms the existed methods in the way of    magnitude order of reconstructing secure command key. Besides, the    extraction of direct secure command key associated each intended    receiver is fast operated to succeed the subsequent e-mail message    recovery.

IEEE,A Novel Non-Intrusive User Authentication Method based on Touchscreen of    Smartphones,,2013,,,212-216,,"In recent years, the functionality of smartphones has been rapidly    improved; then, the smartphones are not only used for telecommunication    but also for various applications, such as email and social network    accessing. These applications raise new security issues to smartphone    users; however, the current protection mechanisms of smartphones are not    sufficient due to convenience issue and shoulder-surfing issue. We    therefore propose a non-intrusive authentication approach based on    touchscreen of smartphones. To the best of our knowledge, this work is    the first publicly reported study that adopts the histogram features of    touchscreen to build an authentication model for smartphone users. Our    empirical results for fifty-five participants show that the proposed    approach is feasible.

One area where mobile applications are making a    remarkable impact is in the realm of Occupational Health and Safety    (OHS). The integration of mobile applications in OHS practices has    ushered in a new era of efficiency, accessibility, and data-driven    decision-making, elevating workplace safety standards to unprecedented    heights. Occupational health and safety are paramount concerns for    organizations as they strive to create safe and healthy work    environments for their employees. Historically, OHS management relied on    manual and paper-based processes, which could be time-consuming,    error-prone, and challenging to track comprehensively. However, with the    advent of mobile technology, organizations now have the opportunity to    streamline their OHS protocols, enhance communication, and proactively    manage workplace risks, all through the convenience of mobile    applications. This research aims to analyze the effects between    perceived ease of use and the attitude towards the use of the mobile    application. Perceived usefulness of applications on Attitude towards    the use of the app, attitude towards the use of the app on intention to    use the application. The population of this research is the employees    from the oil and gas industry in Malaysia. The theory of the Technology    Acceptance Model (TAM) was applied. Perceived danger, perceived utility,    perceived ease of use, and perceived intention to use were the    antecedents for mobile apps. Employees' intentions to use mobile    applications were shown to be significantly influenced by their    satisfaction with the information system and their inventiveness. In    this study, devices were categorized as large or small according to    their screen size, while respondents were categorized as young (<30    years old) or old (>30 years old) according to their age. A data    collection of 545 responses to an online survey with 32 questions was    obtained for analysis. The survey was distributed via email to    respondents using a Survey among employees. The factors impacting the    intention to use mobile applications were investigated using structural    equation modeling. We looked at the moderating impact of the app's    trustworthiness on users' intentions to use/adopt it. The variables'    responses for perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude    towards the use of the App, trust (integrity) of the App, and intention    to use/adopt the application varied significantly between the subgroups,    according to the results. The study also showed the existence of    moderating effects on the intention to use/adopt an app related to the    trust integrity of the app. This paper discusses the survey, the    findings, and the ramifications of the observations. This research    contributes to the current literature by presenting empirical evidence    on the importance of trustworthiness and user attitudes in mobile app    adoption in the oil and gas industry. It also discusses the broader    implications for improving workplace safety through the strategic use of    mobile devices in OHS practices.",SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",Article,English,"Naji, GMA (Corresponding Author), Univ Teknol PETRONAS, Dept Management \& Humanities, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia.

By using k-anonymity (K-A) and differential privacy (DP),    an algorithm model combining K-A and DP was proposed, which was    simulated through the experiments. In the Magic and EIA datasets, the    algorithm constructed was compared with K-A and the L-diversity model to    verify the performance of the model. The model constructed based on DP    had the lowest privacy-leakage risks, which increased with the number of    identifiers in the Magic and EIA datasets, and the information    disclosure was the least. In addition, in its usability analysis, it was    found that its value was the most obviously improved and its operation    efficiency was the highest. The K-A-DP algorithm can effectively reduce    the risk of privacy leakage and information loss, and has achieved    excellent results.

IOP,Impact of an on-line health safety exam on the students of college of    science laboratories,,2018,1032,012051,,,"In spite of education institutes subject their staff and students to a    compulsory health safety course; however, many events have proven that    college students do not follow the correct health safety instructions in    case of emergencies. In this paper, an on-line exam of health safety was    designed and implemented. PhP programming language was used to design    the web pages of the exam while the data base was manipulated by MySQL    language. The exam consists of about 20 specialized questions for each    of all College of Science departments. The user should be able to access    the exam through the website of the University or the College. Also, the    user should register by entering his name, email, and password. After    the exam practicing, the user will be notified about his score and if    he/she put the correct or wrong answer for every question individually.    The user can retry the exam again until he has got the full mark, which    is the only mark that allows the examinee to pass the exam and then will    be authorized to access the college laboratories and other workplaces.    The student can know his mark through his email directly. The admin will    also know all the examined students and their marks. Consequently, the    college departments could be provided with a list of practiced students.    The aim of this research focuses on increasing the education level of    the health safety of the students and staff inside the laboratories of    universities. So it ensures the entire workers at our laboratories will    be conscious in case of any emergencies.

ACM,The Influence of Context on Response to Spear-Phishing Atacks: an    In-Situ Deception Study,,2023,,619,,,"In today's digitized societies, phishing attacks are a security threat    with damaging consequences. Organizations remain vulnerable to phishing    attacks, and it is not clear how the work context influences people's    perceptions and behaviors related to phishing attempts. I investigate    (1) how contextual factors influence reactions to a spear-phishing    attempt, (2) why people report or do not report phishing attempts, (3)    which opportunities for security-enhancing interventions people    identify. I use an in-situ deception methodology to observe participants    (N=14) in their realistic work environment. I triangulate observational    and self-reported data to obtain rich qualitative insights into    participants' emotions, thoughts, and actions when receiving a targeted    phishing email. I find that task, IT, internal and social context play    an important role. The email's request being aligned with expectations    and perceived time pressure when responding to emails were associated    with insecure behavior.

First, building    from previous research, we examined the impact of individual    characteristics such as personality traits (Big 5 and Locus of Control),    expertise (security and phishing knowledge), and technology usage.    Second, social engineering tactics were considered as a potential    factor, based on the specifications of the NIST Phish Scale, a metric    for rating an email's human phishing detection difficulty. Third, the    impact of contextual factors, such as world events, were investigated.    Data was collected from study participants via a survey on their    individual differences, followed by campaigns in which they were emailed    a total of eight messages (four phishing and four controls) over a    fourweek period of time.

"Pagan, Jr., Alexander and Elleithy, Khaled",A Multi-Layered Defense Approach to Safeguard Against Ransomware,,2021,,1570697424,942-947,,"There has been a significant rise in ransomware attacks over the last    few years. Cyber attackers have made use of tried and true ransomware    viruses to target the government, health care, and educational    institutions. Ransomware variants can be purchased on the dark web by    amateurs giving them the same attack tools used by professional cyber    attackers without experience or skill. Traditional antivirus and    antimalware products have improved, but they alone fall short when it    comes to catching and stopping ransomware attacks. Employee training has    become one of the most important aspects of being prepared for attempted    cyberattacks. However, training alone only goes so far; human error is    still the main entry point for malware and ransomware infections. In    this paper, we propose a multi-layered defense approach to safeguard    against ransomware. We have come to the startling realization that it is    not a matter of ``if{''} your organization will be hit with ransomware,    but ``when{''} your organization will be hit with ransomware. If an    organization is not adequately prepared for an attack or how to respond    to an attack, the effects can be costly and devastating. Our approach    proposes having innovative antimalware software on the local machines,    properly configured firewalls, active DNS/Web filtering, email security,    backups, and staff training. With the implementation of this layered    defense, the attempt can be caught and stopped at multiple points in the    event of an attempted ransomware attack. If the attack were successful,    the layered defense provides the option for recovery of affected data    without paying a ransom.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Pagán, A (Corresponding Author), Univ Bridgeport, Dept Comp Sci \& Engn, Bridgeport, CT 06604 USA.

While hippotherapy has    been widely researched among pediatric populations with neuromuscular    disorders, limited evidence exists regarding hippotherapy for adult    populations. This study describes the practice patterns, safety    patterns, and changes in these trends over time for clinicians who    incorporate hippotherapy into treatment plans for adult populations in    the United States (USA). Design: A survey was distributed via email    listserv to American Hippotherapy Association, Inc. (AHA, Inc.) and    Professional Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship, International    (PATH, Intl.) members for 5 consecutive years. Clinicians were included    in the study if they worked with adults (ages 18-64), practiced in the    USA and were licensed physical therapists, physical therapy assistants,    occupational therapists, occupational therapy assistants,    speech-language pathologists, and speech-language pathologist    assistants. Descriptive analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel.    Results: The majority of the clinicians were physical therapists (2019 n    = 8; 2020 n = 21; 2021 n = 26; 2022 n = 20; 2023 n = 20) working with    clients who had cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorder, or attention    deficit disorder aged 18-26 and addressing neuromuscular client factors.    Across the five years, <0.001-0.012 out of every one session included an    emergency dismount, <0.001-0.003 out of every one session resulted in a    safety occurrence that required on-site first aid, and <0.001-0.01 out    of every one session resulted in an injury that required off-site first    aid. Conclusions: The study findings describe consistent practice and    safety patterns across time for adult clients with low numbers of    adverse events. As the population ages, hippotherapy should be    considered more often for adult clients. Clinicians can educate    referring providers to advertise hippotherapy as adult-inclusive or    age-friendly as appropriate. Researchers should examine the efficacy of    hippotherapy for specific adult populations to guide the practice of    clinicians incorporating hippotherapy into treatment plans for adult    clients. Educators in accredited therapy programs and the AHA, Inc.    should consider expanding their curriculum to include more    adult-specific information for hippotherapy and draw attention to how    and why the treatment strategy should be used with this population.",CABI PUBLISHING,"C/O PUBLISHING DIVISION, NOSWORTHY WAY, WALLINGFORD OX10 8DE, OXON,    ENGLAND",Article,English,"Hays, A (Corresponding Author), Univ Wisconsin, Dept Kinesiol, Madison, WI 53706 USA.

We developed an automated system    that notifies responsible physicians of TPAD results via secure, network    email. We sought to evaluate the impact of this system on self-reported    awareness of TPAD results by responsible physicians, a necessary    intermediary step to improve management of TPAD results.    Methods We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial at a major    hospital affiliated with an integrated healthcare delivery network in    Boston, Massachusetts. Adult patients with TPADs who were discharged    from inpatient general medicine and cardiology services were assigned to    the intervention or usual care arm if their inpatient attending    physician and primary care physician (PCP) were both randomized to the    same study arm. Patients of physicians randomized to discordant study    arms were excluded. We surveyed these physicians 72 h after all TPAD    results were finalized. The primary outcome was awareness of TPAD    results by attending physicians. Secondary outcomes included awareness    of TPAD results by PCPs, awareness of actionable TPAD results, and    provider satisfaction.    Results We analyzed data on 441 patients. We sent 441 surveys to    attending physicians and 353 surveys to PCPs and received 275 and 152    responses from 83 different attending physicians and 112 different PCPs,    respectively (attending physician survey response rate of 63\%).    Intervention attending physicians and PCPs were significantly more aware    of TPAD results (76\% vs 38\%, adjusted/clustered OR 6.30 (95\% CI 3.02    to 13.16), p<0.001; 57\% vs 33\%, adjusted/clustered OR 3.08 (95\% CI    1.43 to 6.66), p=0.004, respectively).

However, in an online email classi-fication    experiment ( N = 472), we found no empirical evidence that the presence    of these features was associated with better phishing email    discrimination. We also manipulated time pressure and found that it    significantly reduced detection accuracy. Participants rarely inspected    the URLs associated with links in the phishing emails but, when they    did, their detection performance improved. Better performance in    distinguishing between genuine and phishing emails was linked to lower    levels of an intuitive decision-making style and relatively lower    education levels amongst a highly educated sample. Older participants    and those with greater computer proficiency and stronger email habit    showed a slight increase in ten-dency to judge emails as suspicious. The    results are discussed in terms of intervention strategies such as cyber    security training to improve resilience to phishing attacks.Crown    Copyright (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We    compared traditional facts-and-advice training against training that    uses a simple story to convey the same lessons. We found a surprising    interaction effect: facts-and-advice training works better than not    training users, but only when presented by a security expert. Stories    don't work quite as well as facts-and-advice, but work much better when    told by a peer. This suggests that the perceived origin of training    materials can have a surprisingly large effect on security outcomes.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Wash, R (Corresponding Author), Michigan State Univ, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.

"Littlefield, Jon","THE US GUN CULTURE SEEN THROUGH THE LENS OF CONSUMER CULTURE THEORY:    SELF-SUFFICIENCY, SAFETY, AND PRIVACY",,2013,15,BD9SQ,25-40,,"Purpose - The discussion about firearms in the United States often    involves a contentious confrontation between two polarized groups: gun    owners and those that might increase regulation of guns. The former    group often uses rights-based arguments, including the Second Amendment    to the U.S. Constitution, while the latter assesses problems related to    gun violence from a collectivist perspective, focusing on the health,    social, and policy implications of firearm ownership. The National Rifle    Association (NRA) adds to the mix through communicating and lobbying    activities.    Methodology - The chapter uses qualitative data and interpretive methods    to gain an in-depth insight into the values of the gun culture and the    role of the NRA in this community. Data used are from nine depth    interviews with gun owners and field notes derived from participant    observation in addition to examination of email communications sent by    the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action.    Findings - Three significant values espoused by members of the culture -    self-sufficiency, safety, and privacy - are based on the individualist    perspective and this perspective is reinforced by public narrative    provided by the NRA.    Research limitations/implications - A limitation is the geographic    limitation on data collection, although it is expected that rural gun    culture does not vary significantly throughout the United States. The    study has implications for a more nuanced understanding of the gun    debate in the United States by suggesting how the narrative is    structured by lobbying groups such as the NRA.    Originality/value of paper - This chapter provides insight into the U.S.    gun culture that has not been previously addressed through a consumer    culture theory lens.",EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",Proceedings Paper,English,"Littlefield, J (Corresponding Author), Dalton State Coll, Dalton, GA 30720 USA.

IEEE,No Phishing With the Wrong Bait: Reducing the Phishing Risk by Address    Separation,,2020,,,646-652,,"Email-based phishing is still a widespread problem, that affects many    users worldwide. Although many aspects of phishing have been extensively    studied in the past, they mainly focus on the execution and prevention    of different types of phishing and do not consider the process how    attackers collect the contact information of potential victims. In this    paper, we analyze the collection process of email addresses in more    detail. Based on the results of this analysis, we propose email address    separation as a way for users to detect phishing emails, and reason    about its effectiveness against several typical types of phishing    attacks. We find, that email address separation has the potential to    greatly reduce the perceived authenticity of general phishing emails,    that target a large amount of users, e.g., by impersonating a popular    service and spreading malware or links to phishing websites. It is,    however, not likely to prevent more sophisticated phishing attacks, that    do not depend on the impersonation of a previously known organization or    entity. Our results motivate further studies to analyze the usability    and applicability of the proposed method, and to determine, whether    address separation has additional positive effects on users' phishing    awareness or automated phishing detection.",IEEE COMPUTER SOC,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Drury, V (Corresponding Author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Comp Sci, Aachen, Germany.

IEEE,A taxonomy of SQL Injection Attacks,,2013,,,269-273,,"Nowadays web applications play an important role in online business    including social networks, online services, banking, shopping, classes,    email and etc. Ease of use and access to web application make them more    popular in offering online services instead of in person services. a    simple user just need a computer and an internet connection to access    web application and use online services provided by that application.    There is one core in common between all dynamic web application and that    is their need to use a database to store information inside that and    retrieve that information upon the user request or add, edit and delete    them. Among all database types, rational databases are very popular.    Most of relational database management systems such as MySQL, Oracle, MS    SQL Server, MS Access, Postgres use SQL as their language. Flexibility    of SQL makes it a powerful language. It allows the user to ask what    information he wants without having any knowledge about how the    information will be fetch. However vast use of SQL based databases make    it the center of attention of hackers. SQL injection attack is a    well-known security threat to database driven web applications. A    successful SQL injection attack reveals critical confidential    information to the hacker. In this paper first we provided background    information on this vulnerability. Next we present a comprehensive    review of different types of SQL injection attack. For each attack we    provide an example that shows how the attack launches.

However, despite the obvious benefits, progress    towards this is frustratingly slow. In the meantime, many systematic    reviews have already collected IPD from clinical trials. We propose that    a central repository for these IPD should be established to ensure that    these datasets are safeguarded and made available for use by others,    building on the strengths and advantages of the collaborative groups    that have been brought together in developing the datasets.    Objective: Evaluate the level of support, and identify major issues, for    establishing a central repository of IPD.    Design: On-line survey with email reminders.    Participants: 71 reviewers affiliated with the Cochrane Collaboration's    IPD Meta-analysis Methods Group were invited to participate.    Results: 30 (42\%) invitees responded: 28 (93\%) had been involved in an    IPD review and 24 (80\%) had been involved in a randomised trial. 25    (83\%) agreed that a central repository was a good idea and 25 (83\%)    agreed that they would provide their IPD for central storage. Several    benefits of a central repository were noted: safeguarding and    standardisation of data, increased efficiency of IPD meta-analyses,    knowledge advancement, and facilitating future clinical, and    methodological research. The main concerns were gaining permission from    trial data owners, uncertainty about the purpose of the repository,    potential resource implications, and increased workload for IPD    reviewers. Restricted access requiring approval, data security,    anonymisation of data, and oversight committees were highlighted as    issues under governance of the repository.    Conclusion: There is support in this community of IPD reviewers, many of    whom are also involved in clinical trials, for storing IPD in a central    repository. Results from this survey are informing further work on    developing a repository of IPD which is currently underway by our group.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",Article,English,"Smith, CT (Corresponding Author), Univ Liverpool, Dept Biostat, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England.

The design and development of a home security system, based on    human face recognition technology and remotely monitoring technology, to    confirm visitor identity and to control door accessibility has been    reported in this paper. This paper describes about the implementation    and deployment of wireless control system and accessibility in to a home    environment for authenticated people only. A wireless network technique    ZigBee based and image processing technique PCA based, dedicatedly make    the security system alive as per the request. ZigBee module and    electromagnetic door lock module combinedly operate the door    accessibility, has been designed and developed. Face detection and    recognition algorithms, as well as a wireless interface are used to    detect and identify visitors and send an email and/or an alert message    about the current home environment status via GSM network automatically    to the home owner's mobile phone or any communication devices. The    concerned authority can control the system through his/her mobile phone    or any communication devices by sending AT Commands to GSM MODEM or by    taking necessary actions for authentication through email, which is    again password protected. Users can monitor visitors and control the    door lock on active Web pages enhanced with JavaScript and HTML.

Evidence-based tools often fail to have the intended impact because of    suboptimal uptake or poor implementation.Objective: In this paper, we    aimed to describe the process of developing evidence-based    implementation strategies to support the deployment and use of the CSRS    in real-world emergency department settings to improve syncope    management among physicians.Methods: We followed a systematic approach    for intervention development, including identifying who needs to do what    differently, identifying the barriers and enablers to be addressed, and    identifying the intervention components and modes of delivery to    overcome the identified barriers. We used the Behaviour Change Wheel to    guide the selection of implementation strategies. We engaged CSRS end    users (ie, emergency medicine physicians) in a user-centered design    approach to generate and refine strategies. This was achieved over a    series of 3 qualitative user-centered design workshops lasting 90    minutes each with 3 groups of emergency medicine physicians. Results: A    total of 14 physicians participated in the workshops. The themes were    organized according to the following intervention development steps:    theme 1-identifying and refining barriers and theme 2-identifying the    intervention components and modes of delivery. Theme 2 was subdivided    into two subthemes: (1) generating high-level strategies and developing    strategies prototypes and (2) refining and testing strategies. The main    strategies identified to overcome barriers included education in the    format of meetings, videos, journal clubs, and posters (to address    uncertainty around when and how to apply the CSRS); the development of a    web-based calculator and integration into the electronic medical record    (to address uncertainty in how to apply the CSRS); a local champion (to    address the lack of team buy-in); and the dissemination of evidence    summaries and feedback through email communications (to address a lack    of evidence about impact).Conclusions: The ability of the CSRS to    effectively improve patient safety and syncope management relies on    broad buy-in and uptake across physicians. To ensure that the CSRS is    well positioned for impact, a comprehensive suite of strategies was    identified to address known barriers.(JMIR Hum Factors 2023;10:e44089)    doi: 10.2196/44089","JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC","130 QUEENS QUAY East, Unit 1100, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",Article,English,"Rouleau, G (Corresponding Author), Womens Coll Hosp, Inst Hlth Syst Solut \& Virtual Care, 76 Grenville St, Toronto, ON M5S1B2, Canada.

Since then, the use of intravitreal bevacizumab    has spread worldwide, but the drug-related adverse events associated    with its use have been reported only in a few retrospective reviews. The    International Intravitreal Bevacizumab Safety Survey was initiated to    gather timely information regarding adverse events from doctors around    the world via the internet.    Methods: An internet-based survey was designed to identify adverse    events associated with intravitreal bevacizumab treatment. The survey    web address was disseminated to the international vitreoretinal    community via email. Rates of adverse events were calculated from    participant responses.    Results: 70 centres from 12 countries reported on 7113 injections given    to 5228 patients. Doctor-reported adverse events included corneal    abrasion, lens injury, endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, inflammation    or uveitis, cataract progression, acute vision loss, central retinal    artery occlusion, subretinal haemorrhage, retinal pigment epithelium    tears, blood pressure elevation, transient ischaemic attack,    cerebrovascular accident and death.

Despite the intricacies of spam    classification, reliance on user feedback may inadvertently skew filters    to misclassify legitimate and malicious emails, as users are prone to    flag innocuous commercial mail as spam rather than unsubscribing.    Current spam datasets have a propensity to include such user-flagged    spam which can lead to further misclassification, leading to filters    biased against warranted commercial correspondence. Motivated to address    this concern, we introduce two new classification categories that delve    deeper into the nuances of spam. `Warranted spam', refers to consensual    communications, from a credible source with transparent and safe opt-out    mechanisms, and `unwarranted spam' describes unsolicited messages, often    of a malicious nature. Utilizing these classifications, we propose an    innovative and dynamic `warranted spam' dataset that seeks to pave the    way for researchers to develop more sophisticated spam filtering    techniques. Furthermore, our study delves into pioneering machine    learning and natural language processing approaches, harnessing our    dataset's potential. The overarching aspiration of our work is to    augment online safety, preserve brand integrity, and optimize both the    user experience and the efficacy of email marketing campaigns.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Proceedings Paper,English,"Martin, EBS (Corresponding Author), Dept Comp Sci, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.

By understanding trial participants' attitudes and    experiences, researchers may be better able to accommodate their    interests when designing and conducting research studies. This study    sought insight into attitudes and experiences of spinal muscular atrophy    (SMA) clinical trial participants by surveying people who participated    in SMA clinical trials in the USA. The data used in analysis reflected    70 unique clinical trial experiences. Survey responses revealed positive    attitudes about clinical trial management overall. Top motivators for    trial participation included clinical benefit, investigational drug    access, and the opportunity to help others. Top concerns were safety,    whether benefits would justify risks, and concerns about pain    accompanying tests. The greatest stressors were fear of pain, adverse    event concerns, and challenges managing medical complications of SMA.    Top benefits of trial participation were hope for a better future,    helping others, and relationships with the study team. Whether or not    specific motivators, concerns, stressors, and benefits were important    was predicted by participant gender, age, and race, as well as    respondent type (participant or caregiver), knowledge about SMA,    distance to the trial site, and treatment era. Top recommendations for    improving study management all related to receiving more information.    This research provides new perspective on patient experiences in SMA    clinical trials, and may be used to inform future study design and    interactions with research participants.    Introduction Understanding clinical trial experiences can illuminate    opportunities to optimize trial design and management, with potential    benefits for recruitment and retention. This study sought to better    understand clinical trial participant experiences and attitudes within    spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and how the evolving treatment landscape    and participant characteristics may predict attitudes. Methods A survey    was developed following a review of published literature and discussions    with caregivers of SMA trial participants. This was distributed via    email to known trial participants in Cure SMA's database, announcements    in Cure SMA's newsletter, and emails to SMA clinical trial principal    investigators. Results Seventy complete surveys reflecting unique    clinical trial experiences were included in analysis. Responses revealed    positive attitudes about clinical trial management overall. Top    motivators for trial participation included clinical benefit,    investigational drug access, and the opportunity to help others. Top    concerns were safety, whether benefits would justify risks, and concerns    about pain accompanying tests. The greatest stressors were fear of pain,    adverse event concerns, and challenges managing medical complications of    SMA. Top benefits of trial participation were hope for a better future,    helping others, and relationships with the study team. In regression    analysis, participant gender, age, and race all emerged as significant    predictors (p < 0.05) of motivators, concerns, stressors, and benefits,    as did respondent type, knowledge about SMA, distance to the trial site,    and treatment era. Top recommendations for improving study management    all related to receiving more information. Conclusion This research    provides new perspective on patient experiences in SMA clinical trials.    It underscores the importance of information and efforts to anticipate    and accommodate participant needs. These findings may inform study    design and interactions with research participants.

The Mixed Platoon Hierarchical Control (MPHC)    model innovatively addresses these dynamics by integrating advanced    control strategies that optimize the coexistence of CAVs and HVs.    Specifically, the model introduces two novel approaches: the Incorporate    Real-time Changes in Dynamic Headway (IRC\_DH), which dynamically    adjusts CAV headways by utilizing real-time traffic data and road    conditions, enhancing platoon efficiency and reducing headway by up to    24.35\%; and the Incorporate Controls to Improve Response Speed    (IC\_IRS) for HVs, a multi-variable control strategy that considers    vehicle states, reducing speed differentials by as much as 53.125\%,    thereby stabilizing platoon dynamics and significantly lowering    collision risks. These strategies distinguish themselves from existing    approaches by providing a more precise, adaptable, and robust solution    to the dynamic challenges of mixed traffic flow, addressing both    efficiency and safety. Simulation results confirm that these strategies    significantly improve traffic flow efficiency and safety, providing a    scalable and adaptable framework for traffic management in mixed    vehicular environments. This work makes a substantial contribution to    the field by emphasizing a comprehensive, real-time, and    multi-dimensional approach to managing mixed traffic environments,    thereby advancing the state-of-the-art in CAV-HV integration.",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Article,English,"Liang, J (Corresponding Author), Jiangsu Univ, Automot Engn Res Inst, Zhenjiang 212013, Peoples R China.

Phishing is one of the most prevalent methods used to socially engineer    human targets, and as such it is important to establish which factors    may influence susceptibility to phishing emails. The majority of    research has thus far been dedicated to individual level and semantic    factors of susceptibility, while other important issues such as    organisational context have been largely absent. This paper explores    whether industry type influences behaviours resulting from phishing    simulations. Here we present a large sample of real-world data from    phishing simulations deployed to employees from banking, education,    healthcare and pharmaceutical organisations and construction. Analyses    were conducted across multiple potential responses - opening an email,    clicking a link, replying to the email, entering data, and reporting the    email as suspicious. The results revealed significant differences in    susceptibility to phishing depending on which industry type employees    belonged to. Consistent with previous work, the banking industry had the    fewest number of employees engaged in opening phishing emails and    clicking links.

Various factors can cause damage and    interference between different users of the same radio spectrum.    Cognitive radio provides an ideal and balanced solution to these types    of problems (overload and congestion in the spectrum). The cognitive    radio concept is based on the flexible use of any available frequency    band of the radio spectrum that could be detected. In the world of    cognitive radio, we distinguish two categories of networks, namely the    primary ones, which have priority and control over access to the radio    spectrum, and the secondary ones, called cognitive radio networks, which    allocate the spectrum dynamically. In this paper, we focus on the    dynamic management of the radio spectrum based on a multi-criteria    algorithm to ensure the quality of service (QoS) of the utilization by    secondary users. Our approach is to use a multi-agent system based on    autonomous learning and focused on a competitive cognitive environment.    In this paper, we evaluate the secondary user's performance in an ideal    environment of cognitive radio systems; we use the multi-agent platform    called Java Agent Development (JADE), in which we implement a program    that applies the multi-criteria TOPSIS algorithm to choose the best    primary user (PU) among several PUs detected in the radio spectrum.

The basic    requirement for each user is to have a separate ID known as Mail    Identity. That ID is used for all purposes specified above. Each user    can have more than one ID for different mail services including social    networking. But most of the Mail ID's are not really safe and are easily    accessible by anyone. Nowadays, most of the mail servers providing Email    communication for their valuable users. Among the mail servers, some of    them only have well secured communications. We analyzed some well    secured mail servers regarding their security based on some unchancy    hacking techniques. From our analysis, we found some of the loopholes    are in existing mail servers, which are allowing the hackers, to hack    the victim's account. In this paper, we described some dangerous    techniques that are considered as loopholes in the existing mail    servers. Beyond the loopholes, we analyzed some vulnerabilities from    existing mail servers. To compromise the loopholes and vulnerabilities,    we planned to create a new mail server as a solution to block the given    problems.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Rahim, MA (Corresponding Author), Velammal Coll Engn \& Technol, Dept Informat Technol, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India.

However,    most ORE constructions merely support ciphertext comparison for    single-user. Recently, a variant of ORE named delegatable ORE has been    introduced, which achieves cross-user ciphertext comparison by employing    token mutual authorization technique at the cost of weak security, i.e.,    reveals the most significant differing bit of underlying plaintexts. To    tackle this problem, we first present a deterministic    property-preserving hash called DPPH with short-size hash value, and    then propose a novel multi-client ORE scheme (m-ORE) from DPPH that    supports ciphertext comparison among multiple users while hiding the    most significant differing bits. Furthermore, we present an enhanced    construction dubbed m-H-ORE by introducing a two-phase comparison    method, which can achieve supper-efficient comparison in some cases,    i.e., two ciphertexts with different bit-length. Finally, we provide    formal security proofs of the proposed schemes and run extensive    experiments to evaluate their performance on real-world and synthetic    datasets. The results demonstrate that both of the proposed schemes can    achieve a speedup of 47x and 138x in comparison cost to that of    parameter-hiding ORE, respectively.",IEEE COMPUTER SOC,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",Article,English,"Wang, JF (Corresponding Author), Xidian Univ, Sch Cyber Engn, Xian 710071, Peoples R China.

Design and setting Observational cohort study conducted in 194 sentinel    surveillance immunisation sites (primary care, hospital and    community-based clinics) across Australia.    Participants Individuals aged >= 6 months who received a routine    seasonal influenza vaccine at a participating site (n=102 911) and    responded to a survey (via short message service or email) sent 3 days    after vaccination about adverse events experienced (n=73 892; 71.8\%).    Main outcome measure Near real-time and cumulative participant-reported    rates of any adverse event, fever or medical attendance experienced    within 3 days after vaccination overall, by brand, age, pregnancy status    and concomitant vaccine receipt.    Results Participant median age was 57 years (range: 6 months to 102    years); 58.1\% (n=42 869) were female and 2.7\% (n=2018) were pregnant.    Near real-time fast initial response cumulative summation and Bayesian    analyses of weekly event rates did not demonstrate a safety signal.    Children aged 6 months to 4 years had higher event rates (522/6180;    8.4\%) compared with older ages; participants aged >= 65 years reported    fewer events (1695/28 154; 6.0\%). There were no clinically significant    differences in safety between brands, by age group or overall.

IEEE,Classifying User Activities in the Encrypted WeChat Traffic,,2018,,,,,"The security and privacy of encrypted mobile applications have attracted    the attention of researchers. However, most of the existing researches    focus on analysis of SSL/TLS traffic, while few studies focus on    proprietary encrypted traffic, which is also important and challenging.    In this paper, we make a deep study of WeChat, which is one of the most    popular social applications in the world with over one billion active    users. The application uses a proprietary encryption protocol called as    MMTLS for most of its communications. It is designed based on Transport    Layer Security (TLS) 1.3 drafts for both performance and security. We    explore the fine-grained classification of typical user activities    inside the MMTLS encrypted channels and compare the MMTLS with the HTTPS    (e.g. flow duration and packet size), which are jointly used in WeChat.    It is found that MMTLS is suitable for scenarios of low latency and    lightweight messaging. With the WeChat traffic collected from different    platforms (Android, iOS) and devices (Huawei, Samsung, iPhone, iPad,    etc.) by different users, we classify seven typical activities,    encrypted by MMTLS protocol such as payment, advertisement click,    browsing moments and so on. The experimental results show that both of    the average precision and recall can reach over 92\%. Our work is the    first to perform classification on this proprietary encrypted protocol    and understanding the difference between MMTLS and TLS. It is believed    that the work will benefit the security and privacy of WeChat and other    proprietary encryption applications.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Hou, CS (Corresponding Author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Informat Engn, Beijing, Peoples R China.

However, existing patient self -reporting systems often cannot    address patients' various experiences and concerns regarding medication    safety over time. In addition, these systems are usually not designed    for patients' just -in -time reporting. There is a significant knowledge    gap in understanding the nature, scope, and causes of medication safety    events after patients' transition back home because of a lack of patient    engagement in self -monitoring and reporting of safety events. The    challenges for patients with cancer in adopting digital technologies and    engaging in self -reporting medication safety events during transitions    of care have not been fully understood. Objective: We aim to assess    oncology patients' perceptions of medication and communication safety    during care transitions and their willingness to use digital    technologies for self -reporting medication safety events and to    identify factors associated with their technology acceptance. Methods: A    cross-sectional survey study was conducted with adult patients with    breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal cancer (N=204) who had experienced    care transitions from hospitals or clinics to home in the past 1 year.    Surveys were conducted via phone, the internet, or email between    December 2021 and August 2022. Participants' perceptions of medication    and communication safety and perceived usefulness, ease of use, attitude    toward use, and intention to use a technology system to report their    medication safety events from home were assessed as outcomes. Potential    personal, clinical, and psychosocial factors were analyzed for their    associations with participants' technology acceptance through bivariate    correlation analyses and multiple logistic regressions. Results:    Participants reported strong perceptions of medication and communication    safety, positively correlated with medication self -management ability    and patient activation. Although most participants perceived a    medication safety self -reporting system as useful (158/204, 77.5\%) and    easy to use (157/204, 77\%), had a positive attitude toward use    (162/204, 79.4\%), and were willing to use such a system (129/204,    63.2\%), their technology acceptance was associated with their    activation levels (odds ratio {[}OR] 1.83, 95\% CI 1.12-2.98), their    perceptions of communication safety (OR 1.64, 95\% CI 1.08-2.47), and    whether they could receive feedback after self -reporting (OR 3.27, 95\%    CI 1.37-7.78). Conclusions: In general, oncology patients were willing    to use digital technologies to report their medication events after care    transitions back home because of their high concerns regarding    medication safety. As informed and activated patients are more likely to    have the knowledge and capability to initiate and engage in self    -reporting, developing a patient -centered reporting system to empower    patients and their families and facilitate safety health communications    will help oncology patients in addressing their medication safety    concerns, meeting their care needs, and holding promise to improve the    quality of cancer care.","JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC","130 QUEENS QUAY East, Unit 1100, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",Article,English,"Jiang, Y (Corresponding Author), Univ Michigan, Sch Nursing, 400 North Ingalls St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.

While AR offers    potential in aviation weather education and instructors desire to use it    in the classroom, they face challenges due to limited digital    proficiency and complexity of authoring tools. Many existing AR    authoring tools prioritize technical aspects over user experience. To    address these challenges, a no-programming-required AR authoring tool    was developed based on instructor-informed requirements, such as    incorporating features of flight waypoints and weather phenomena. A    total of 41 participants tested the tool by crafting three AR learning    modules. After using the tool, there was a significant increase in    participants' confidence in AR content creation (+30\%), AR authoring    process (+51\%), and interactive AR development (+50\%). In addition,    there was a significant decrease in their concerns about technical    complexity (-19\%), mental effort (-30\%), and time consumption (-30\%).    Participants rated the incorporated functions highly preferable and    indicated the tool has high usability. Participants completed the most    challenging task quickly and with a low cognitive load. The findings    demonstrate the tool's effectiveness in enabling participants to    competently and efficiently author AR content, reducing technical    concerns. Such tools can facilitate the integration of AR technology    into the classroom, offering students improved access to interactive 3-D    visualizations of dynamic subjects, such as aviation weather, which    require students to mentally visualize weather conditions and understand    their manifestations.",IEEE COMPUTER SOC,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",Article,English,"Dorneich, MC (Corresponding Author), Iowa State Univ, Ind \& Mfg Syst Engn Dept, Ames, IA 50011 USA.

ACM,Type Me the Truth! Detecting Deceitful Users via Keystroke Dynamics,,2017,,A60,,,"In this paper, we propose a novel method, based on keystroke dynamics,    to distinguish between fake and truthful personal information written    via a computer keyboard. Our method does not need any prior knowledge    about the user who is providing data. To our knowledge, this is the    first work that associates the typing human behavior with the production    of lies regarding personal information. Via experimental analysis    involving 190 subjects, we assess that this method is able to    distinguish between truth and lies on specific types of autobiographical    information, with an accuracy higher than 75\%. Specifically, for    information usually required in online registration forms (e.g., name,    surname and email), the typing behavior diverged significantly between    truthful or untruthful answers. According to our results, keystroke    analysis could have a great potential in detecting the veracity of    self-declared information, and it could be applied to a large number of    practical scenarios requiring users to input personal data remotely via    keyboard.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Monaro, M (Corresponding Author), Univ Padua, Padua, Italy.

Existing    service-providers provide individual solutions that rely on a trusted    third party and are in general limited in their scope and    interoperability; as a consequence, they are unsuitable for cross-border    application as required by transnational unions like the EU.    In contrast to existing service-providers, we present a working system    for certified email that does not rely on a trusted third party for fair    non-repudiation of receipt. We achieve fair non-repudiation of receipt    through a novel protocol that involves splitting an encrypted message    into a chain of parts, which the addressee gradually acquires,    generating proof-of-receipt for each individual part. The protocol    cryptographically prevents the addressee from obtaining the message in    case they terminate the protocol prematurely.    The universality of the presented system makes it feasible for    unobtrusive operation using existing user agents and e-mail providers.    The system is presented as a proof-ofconcept implementation for the    open-source Mozilla Thunderbird user agent. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

As technology is developed, so also do the risks and threats    associated with it - especially in the forthcoming quantum era. Existing    loT networks, however, lack a quantum-resistant secret key sharing    scheme to meet confidential message transmission demands in wide-area    mobile applications. To address this issue, this article proposes a new    scheme, channel reciprocity (CR), based on quantum key distribution    (QKD) CR-QKD, accomplishes the secret key sharing goal by combining    emerging QKD and CR-based key generation (CRKG) techniques. Exploiting    the laws of quantum physics and wireless channels properties, the    proposed scheme is able to ensure key secrecy, even against    computationally unbounded adversaries. Elaborated for a single-user    case, the basic mechanism is extended into a multi-user case - by    redesigning a multi-user edge forwarding strategy. In addition, to make    CR-QKD more practical, some enhancement strategies are studied to reduce    the time delay, and to improve the secret key generation rate in a    secure manner. A CR-QKD prototype is demonstrated in a metropolitan area    network, where secret keys are shared between two remote loT devices    roughly fifteen kilometers apart. Experimental results have verified    CR-QKD allows a secret key rate of 424 bits per second, with a    retransmission rate of 2.1 percent.",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Article,English,"Li, GY (Corresponding Author), Southeast Univ, Sch Cyber Sci \& Engn, Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Anomaly based    insider detection approaches are generally associated with high false    positives; thus, there has been increased focus on including prediction    of user psychology and attack motivations. However, data relating to    psychological profile and personality trait of employees are challenging    to collect, and do not generally adequately capture attack motivations    such as disgruntlement (e.g. towards certain behavior). Therefore, in    this paper, we demonstrate how one can build a user psychological    profile based on the sentiment analysis of their network browsing and    email content. We then evaluate our approach using real-world datasets,    and the findings suggest that our approach can proactively and    accurately detect malicious insiders with extreme or negative emotional    tendencies.

Therefore,    they exert tremendous effort in securing account authentication.    Although threats from complete outsiders, such as account hijacking for    monetization, still occur, recent studies have shed light on threats to    privacy from insiders. This paper sheds light on the latter threats.    Specifically, we present the first comprehensive study of an attack from    insiders that identifies the existence of a target's account by using    the target's email address and insecure login-related messages    displayed. Such a threat may violate intimates' or acquaintances'    privacy because the kinds of service accounts a user has implies his/her    personal preferences or situation. We conducted surveys regarding user    expectations and behaviors on online services and a measurement study of    the login-related messages on online services that are considered    sensitive. We found that over 80\% of participants answered that there    are sensitive services and that almost all services were vulnerable to    our attack. Moreover, about half the participants who have sensitive    services are insecurely registered on them and thus could be potential    victims.

For this purpose,    authen-tication protocol plays a vital role in web communication which    securely transfers data from one party to another. This authentication    works via OpenID, Kerberos, password authentication protocols, etc.    However, there are still some limitations present in the reported    security protocols. In this paper, the presented anticipated strategy    secures both Web-based attacks by leveraging encoded emails and a novel    password form pattern method. The proposed OpenID-based encrypted    Email's Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (EAAA) protocol    ensure security by relying on the email authenticity and a Special    Secret Encrypted Alphanumeric String (SSEAS). This string is deployed on    both the relying party and the email server, which is unique and    trustworthy. The first authentication, OpenID Uniform Resource Locator    (URL) identity, is performed on the identity provider side. A second    authentication is carried out by the hidden Email's server side and    receives a third authentication link. This Email's third SSEAS    authentication link manages on the relying party (RP). Compared to    existing cryptographic single sign-on protocols, the EAAA protocol    ensures that an OpenID URL's identity is secured from MITM and phishing    attacks. This study manages two attacks such as MITM and phishing    attacks and gives 339 ms response time which is higher than the already    reported methods, such as Single Sign-On (SSO) and OpenID. The    experimental sites were examined by 72 information technology (IT)    specialists, who found that 88.89\% of respondents successfully    validated the user authorization provided to them via Email. The    proposed EAAA protocol minimizes the higher-level risk of MITM and    phishing attacks in an OpenID-based atmosphere.",TECH SCIENCE PRESS,"871 CORONADO CENTER DR, SUTE 200, HENDERSON, NV 89052 USA",Article,English,"Bilal, M (Corresponding Author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Comp Sci \& Technol, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China.

This study improves our understanding of the risk factors contributing    to young and elderly drivers' elevated crash risk by examining    self-report data from the E-Survey of Road User's Safety Attitudes    (ESRA). The primary objective of this study is to compare the attitudes    and behaviours of young, elderly, and middle-age drivers in Canada, the    United States, and Europe. The main focus is on the practice of driving    while distracted by mobile phones and driving while fatigued, as these    are two dangerous behaviours that demonstrate the impact age may have.    The analyses consistently showed that there are differences in the    responses attributable to age. In all regions, drivers aged 18-21 years    consistently reported higher rates of distracted and fatigued driving    and higher rates of perceived social and personal acceptability of these    behaviours than drivers aged 35-54 years. Elderly drivers aged 65+ years    reported even lower rates of these behaviours and acceptability. Young    drivers were also the least likely to believe that distraction and    fatigue are frequent causes of road crashes, while elderly drivers were    the most likely to believe this. This pattern with respect to age    repeats in the support for policy measures as well; young drivers are    least likely to support zero tolerance policies for mobile phone use    when driving, while elderly drivers are the most likely to support this    measure. Multivariate logistic regression modeling confirmed that    elderly drivers were the least likely to engage in the use of mobile    phones while driving or driving while fatigued. Statistically    significant results showed that the middle-age group was less likely    than young drivers to read a text message/email or check social media    while driving and driving while fatigued.

"Liu, Sha and Zhu, Shuhua",A Novel QR Code and mobile phone based Authentication protocol via    Bluetooth,,2015,28,,41-49,,"Password based authentication schemes are widely used in our daily life    when we log into websites. However, there are varieties of problems with    the simple methods, including susceptibility to unintentional exposure    via phishing and cross-sites password reuse. We present a novel mobile    phone based authentication scheme, which intends to provide security and    usability greater than that of traditional two-factor authentication    protocols. It contains four parties, i.e. the user, the mobile phone,    the current computer and the remote server. At first, a user's personal    device-mobile phone-stores the key token by scanning QR code, which is    sent from the server after user completes the registration phase.    Secondly, the current computer can use the Bluetooth device address    registered in remote server to launch a connection request and then it    can communicate with the mobile phone via Bluetooth. Thirdly, when user    wants to log into a website, server would transmit an OTP(One time    password) to user's mobile phone through the current computer in order    to verify the user. Finally, our scheme has achieved the mutual    authentication via Bluetooth. Our scheme only needs lower computation.    In terms of users' requirements, our scheme provides request about    changing bind-phone for legal users over the email address registered    during registration phase. After usability and security analysis, we can    demonstrate that the new scheme fits for the complicated network    environment.",ATLANTIS PRESS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",Proceedings Paper,English,"Liu, S (Corresponding Author), Jinan Univ, Sch Informat Sci \& Technol, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.

This approach    uses surveys to collect, aggregate and visualize data in a dashboard to    support cyber coordination and knowledge management. Furthermore, the    online surveys are easy to use and respond to and therefore simplify the    participation of stakeholders.

Nevertheless, there is still poor data on vaccination coverage against    HPV in several countries, including Cyprus. The main target of the    present research was to assess the vaccination status of female students    in Cyprus.Methodology An online survey was conducted via a cloud-based    short questionnaire on Google Forms. Students with a known email address    were initially invited via email to complete the survey. The    questionnaire was distributed to 340 students, aged 18-49 years old, who    lived in Cyprus (60\% response rate).Results The total vaccination    coverage was 38.1\%. The mean age of participants was 23.5 (+/- 6.5)    years. The major reason for non-vaccination was the belief that    participants were not at risk of serious illness from HPV infection    (22\%), followed by the reported lack of time to get vaccinated (16\%)    and inertia (13\%). The students who had information about the safety of    HPV vaccines from electronic sources of information (television,    websites, and blogs) had lower vaccination coverage compared to those    who had received information from alternative sources (primary health    centers, family doctors, or obstetricians) (relative risk (RR) = 1.923,    95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.9669-3.825; p = 0.033).

A    maximum weighted sum secrecy rate problem is formulated by jointly    optimizing the active beamforming (BF) at the base stations and passive    BF at the RISs. To handle this non-trivial problem, we adopt the    alternating optimization to decouple the original problem into two    sub-ones, which are solved using the semidefinite relaxation and    continuous convex approximation theory. To decrease the complexity for    obtaining overall channel state information (CSI), we extend the    proposed framework to the case that only requires part of the RIS' CSI.    This is achieved via deliberately discarding the RIS that has a small    contribution to the user's secrecy rate. Based on this, we formulate a    mixed integer non-linear programming problem, and the linear conic    relaxation is used to obtained the solutions. Meanwhile, we also study    the system performance under the imperfect CSI.

"Weill, Sharon",Reducing the Security Gap through National Courts: Targeted Killings as    a Case Study,JOURNAL OF CONFLICT \& SECURITY LAW,2016,21,"1, SI",49-67,SPR,"This article examines the potential role of national courts in reducing    the `security gap' in the context of armed conflicts. Judges in    democratic States assume different roles. They may variously serve as a    legitimating agent of the State; avoid exercising jurisdiction for    extra-legal considerations; defer to other branches of the government;    enforce the law in line with the rule of law ideal; or develop the law    and introduce forms of ethical judgment that go beyond positive    application of the law. Identifying the various roles assumed by    national judiciaries, their institutional limits and interactions with    the executive offers a useful tool for assessing their potential role in    advancing human security. In relation to the concept of human security,    it has been suggested that the distinction between internal and external    notions of security is becoming increasingly blurred, whereby `internal'    implies judicial guarantees and human rights based security and    `external' implies war-based security. In this context, the changing    roles of national courts in situations of armed conflict that are    explored in the article could be understood as a method for    strengthening human security. The analysis of Israeli and US cases    involving targeted killings suggests that while national courts have    been largely reluctant to limit government action and have tended to    apply international law in a selective manner, they have nonetheless    become increasingly willing to review armed conflict cases, including    State action beyond its territorial borders.",OXFORD UNIV PRESS,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Weill, S (Corresponding Author), Sci Po, Int Law, Paris, France.

Electronic mail, data transfer, and the development of the    Internet have changed the way the world communicates.

Intertwined    herewith, is the significant increase in business related use and    transmission of critical data, ultimately leading to a significant    increase in security risks. This has attracted and encouraged the entry    of common criminals with a high level of computer based skills.

ACM,Bypassing Push-based Second Factor and Passwordless Authentication with    Human-Indistinguishable Notifications,,2021,,,447-461,,"Second factor (2FA) or passwordless authentication based on    notifications pushed to a user's personal device (e.g., a phone) that    the user can simply approve (or deny) has become widely popular due to    its convenience. In this paper, we show that the effortlessness of this    approach gives rise to a fundamental design vulnerability. The    vulnerability stems from the fact that the notification, as shown to the    user, is not uniquely bound to the user's login session running through    the browser, and thus if two notifications are sent around the same time    (one for the user's session and one for an attacker's session), the user    may not be able to distinguish between the two, likely ending up    accepting the notification of the attacker's session. Exploiting this    vulnerability, we present HIENA1, a simple yet devastating attack    against such ``one-push{''} 2FA or passwordless schemes, which can allow    a malicious actor to login soon after the victim user attempts to login    triggering multiple near-concurrent notifications that seem    indistinguishable to the user. To further deceive the user into    accepting the attacker-triggered notification, HIENA can optionally    spoof/mimic the victim's client machine information (e.g., the city from    which the victim logs in, by being in the same city) and even issue    other third-party notifications (e.g., email or social media) for    obfuscation purposes. In case of 2FA schemes, we assume that the    attacker knows the victim's password (e.g., obtained via breached    password databases), a standard methodology to evaluate the security of    any 2FA scheme. To evaluate the effectiveness of HIENA, we carefully    designed and ran a human factors lab study where we tested benign and    adversarial settings mimicking the user interface designs of well-known    one-push 2FA and passwordless schemes. Our results show that users are    prone to accepting attacker's notification in HIENA with high rates,    about 83\% overall and about 99\% upon using spoofed information, which    is almost similar to the rates of acceptance of benign login sessions.    Even for the non-spoofed sessions (our primary attack), the attack    success rates are about 68\%, which go up to about 90-97\% if the attack    attempt is repeated 2-3 times. While we did not see a statistically    significant effect of using third-party notifications on attack success    rate, in real-life, the use of such obfuscation can be quite effective    as users may only see one single 2FA notification (corresponding to    attacker's session) on top of the notifications list which is most    likely to be accepted.

"Kleitman, Sabina and Law, Marvin K. H. and Kay, Judy",It's the deceiver and the receiver: Individual differences in phishing    susceptibility and false positives with item profiling,PLOS ONE,2018,13,e0205089,,OCT 26,"Phishing email is one of the biggest risks to online information    security due to its ability to exploit human trust and naivety. Prior    research has examined whether some people are more susceptible to    phishing than others and what characteristics may predict this    susceptibility. Given that there are no standardised measures or    methodologies to detect phishing susceptibility, results have    conflicted. To address this issue, the current study created a 40-item    phishing detection task to measure both cognitive and behavioural    indicators of phishing susceptibility and false positives (misjudged    genuine email). The task is based on current real-life email stimuli    (i.e., phishing and genuine) relevant to the student and general    population. Extending previous literature we also designed a methodology    for assessing phishing susceptibility by allowing participants to    indicate perception of maliciousness of each email type and the actions    they would take (keep it, trash it or seek further information). This    enabled us to: (1) examine the relationships that psychological    variables share with phishing susceptibility and false positives-both    captured as consistent tendencies; (2) determine the relationships    between perceptions of maliciousness with behavioural outcomes and    psychological variables; and (3) determine the relationships between    these tendencies and email characteristics. In our study, 150    undergraduate psychology students participated in exchange for partial    course credit (98 Females; Mean age = 19.70, SD = 2.27). Participants    also completed a comprehensive battery of psychometric tests assessing    intelligence, pre- and on-task confidence, Big 6 personality, and    familiarity/competence in computing and phishing. Results revealed that    people showed distinct and robust tendencies for phishing susceptibility    and false positives. A series of regression analyses looking at the    accuracy of both phishing and false positives detection revealed that    human-centred variables accounted for a good degree of variance in    phishing susceptibility (about 54\%), with perceptions of maliciousness,    intelligence, knowledge of phishing, and on-task confidence contributing    significantly, directly and/or indirectly via perception of    maliciousness. A regression model looking at discriminating false    positives has also shown that human-centred variables accounted for a    reasonable degree of variance (41\%), with perceptions of maliciousness,    intelligence and on-task confidence contributing significantly, directly    and/or indirectly via perception of maliciousness. Furthermore, the    characteristics of the most effective phishing and misjudged genuine    email items were profiled. Based on our findings, we suggest that future    research should investigate these significant variables in more detail.    We also recommend that future research should capture consistent    response tendencies to determine vulnerability to phishing and false    positives (rather than a one off response to a single email), and use    the collection of the most current phishing email obtained from relevant    sources to the population. It is important to capture perceptions of    maliciousness of email because it is a key predictor of the action taken    on the email. It directly predicts accuracy detection of phishing and    genuine email, as well as mediating the relationships between some other    predictors whose role would have been overlooked if the perceptions were    not captured.    The study provides the framework of human-centred variables which    predict phishing and false positive susceptibility as well as the    characteristics of email which most deceive people.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",Article,English,"Kleitman, S (Corresponding Author), Univ Sydney, Sch Psychol, Sydney, NSW, Australia.

Phishing attempts, in particular through email, persistently    challenge organizations despite substantial investments in IT security    and awareness training. Recognizing the limitations of unilateral    technology- or human-centered approaches, this study explores how visual    risk indication can support employees in detecting phishing attempts. To    do so, we conducted an eyetracking lab experiment in which participants    rated the trustworthiness of emails with varying levels of credibility.    Our analysis focuses on human information processing in identifying    phishing attempts, indicating that the availability of a visual risk    indicator can significantly influence trust and response behavior,    without incapacitating implicit phishing cues (such as conspicuous    senders or anonymous recipients). Our findings suggest that    organizations should appropriately calibrate visual risk indicators to    achieve the intended guiding effects.

The weakest link in any computer security system    is the people and the success of phishing attacks is substantially based    on manipulating human emotions. Therefore, we cannot solely rely on    humans to detect phishing attacks as phishing attacks are becoming more    and more sophisticated and can bypass filters set by anti-phishing    techniques. More effective and automatic phishing detection mechanisms    are required and many detectors have been proposed. However, the high    number of phishing emails and attacks urges additional efforts. In this    study, the effectiveness of word embedding in classifying phishing    emails is investigated. Pre-trained transformer model BERT    (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is fine-tuned    to execute the task of classifying emails into phishing and    non-phishing.

Satish and Revathy, S.",A hybrid soft computing with big data analytics based protection and    recovery strategy for security enhancement in large scale real world    online social networks,THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE,2022,927,,15-30,AUG 26,"In recent years, Online Social Networks (OSN) have become an integral    part of human society. OSN has become an important and crucial mode of    interaction among people around the world. For the past two decades, the    need for data privacy security among the participants of an OSN has been    challenged as technological advances have provided a lot of benefits and    exposure to all active members sharing content in various online    communities. Large amounts of data are usually stored on different    network nodes, which can lead to malicious data security and privacy    issues. When OSN users share any private content with the other    participants of same network like with their friends and colleagues,    their information may be inadvertently leaked to various other    individuals to whom it is not supposed to be shared. Those individuals    may include one's enemies, social robots, and users with fake    credentials, spammers or data cutters. In addition, the spread of    malicious through OSN can lead to massive damage to the network and    privacy leakage. To overcome this problem, we propose a hybrid soft    computing with big data analytics based protection and recovery strategy    (HSBD-PR) for security enhancement in large scale OSNs. First, we    introduce a modified teaching-learning with fish swarm optimization    (MTL-FS) technique to classify the abnormal network users as five    classes are susceptive, contagious, doubt, immune and recoverable users.    Second, we fuse a block window optimization with Bayesian belief network    (BWB2) for analyze the propagation mechanism of abnormal users in    network. After that, deep belief neural network (DBNN) based protection    and recovery strategy is developed to improve the immunity of abnormal    users and reduce the count of it. Finally, the performance of proposed    HSBD-PR approach evaluate by standard benchmark datasets is Enron email,    Epinions and Facebook. The results of this proposed method are compared    with the existing state-of-art methods in terms of different performance    metrics are detection failure rate, detection success rate, marginal    detection gain and detection accuracy respectively.(c) 2022 Published by    Elsevier B.V.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Kumar, AS (Corresponding Author), Sathyabama Inst Engn \& Technol, Sch Comp, Chennai, India.

Nevertheless, the existing PPRE    scheme not only suffers from the burden of certificate management but    also merely achieves selective security based on the nonstandard    assumption. In this article, a puncturable identity-based PRE (P-IB-PRE)    scheme is proposed to efficiently protect the security and privacy of    the group message. The proposed scheme introduces a message server as    the proxy to transform ciphertext for each participant in the group;    thus, the heavy computation overhead is delegated to the message server    with abundant resources. Most importantly, our scheme enables the    recipient to revoke its private key's decryption capability of the    specific messages without affecting other messages. Moreover, the    identity-based mechanism eliminates the burden of certificate management    as well as improves efficiency. The proposed scheme achieves adaptive    security under the standard decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH)    assumption.

IEEE,OPSEC VS Leaked Credentials: Password reuse in Large-Scale Data Leaks,,2023,,,74-79,,"Security and authentication are ubiquitous problems that impact all    modern networked systems. Password-based authentication systems are    still prevalent, and information leaked via other channels may be used    to attack networked systems. Researchers have previously used email    addresses as an identifier in leaked data breach information to    understand password reuse and behaviours, but this has its limitations.    In this work, we explore the use of passwords themselves as identifiers    in linking accounts together to provide an alternative view of    large-scale reuse. We filter for high entropy passwords on the    Compilation of Many Breaches (COMB) data set, which contains 3.2 billion    email/password combinations. Using this approach, we find that passwords    are reused 13 times on average, with a username reuse rate of 66.7\%    (compared to 40\% when considering emails mergers).

ACM,Careless Participants Are Essential for Our Phishing Study:    Understanding the Impact of Screening Methods,,2021,,,36-47,,"Online surveys using crowdsourcing services have been widely adopted in    academic research projects aimed at understanding human perception and    behavior. Because there is a concern that online surveys may include    dishonest or careless responses by crowdworkers who perform a large    number of tasks, or responses by bots, several screening methods have    been proposed to discard such low-quality responses. However, in    security research, especially in phishing research where the attention    of participants is considered to influence the results, the elimination    of careless responses may lead to the removal of participants who should    be included in the research. In this study, we address the following    research question: ``Does the adoption of existing screening methods    bias the results of security surveys?{''} Using Amazon Mechanical Turk    and Prolific Academic, two popular crowdsourcing platforms used in    online surveys, we conducted online user studies (N = 600) on security    knowledge, security behavior, and phishing email detection performance    to elucidate the influence of screening methods on the results. The    obtained results indicate that the adoption of the instructional    manipulation check (IMC) screening method triggers bias in the    demographics of the participants, as well as differences in the results    of phishing email detection performance. In addition, the degree of    these differences depends on the crowdsourcing platform. We also    demonstrated that it is non-trivial to determine the correlation between    screening methods and factors that can influence the results of a survey    on security behavior. These findings suggest that caution should be    exercised when applying screening methods such as attention checks and    IMC in studies where the extent of user attention could have a    significant impact on the results.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Proceedings Paper,English,"Matsuura, T (Corresponding Author), Waseda Univ Japan, Tokyo, Japan.

IEEE,Improving of Current CAPTCHA Systems,,2019,,,,,"the internet these days plays an important role in our daily lives, as    the number of web services are increasing such as search engines and    email, they are threatened by different types of attacks from computer    programs such as robots. In order to solve this problem, CAPTCHA    (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans    Apart) was implemented to be used as a base to distinguish between human    users and computer bots. Although this technique limits the automatic    registration to web services to provide security but, still some    CAPTCHAs have several weaknesses which allow the computer bots to    infiltrate the mechanism of the CAPTCHA.

No serious adverse events (SAES) have    been reported so far in over 18,000 sessions administered to healthy    subjects, neurological and psychiatric patients, as summarized here.    Moderate adverse events (AEs), as defined by the necessity to intervene,    are rare, and include skin burns with tDCS due to suboptimal    electrode-skin contact. Very rarely mania or hypomania was induced in    patients with depression (11 documented cases), yet a causal    relationship is difficult to prove because of the low incidence rate and    limited numbers of subjects in controlled trials. Mild AEs (MAEs)    include headache and fatigue following stimulation as well as prickling    and burning sensations occurring during tDCS at peak-to-baseline    intensities of 1-2 mA and during tACS at higher peak-to-peak intensities    above 2 mA.\& para;\& para;The prevalence of published AEs is different    in studies specifically assessing AEs vs. those not assessing them,    being higher in the former. AEs are frequently reported by individuals    receiving placebo stimulation. The profile of AEs in terms of frequency,    magnitude and type is comparable in healthy and clinical populations,    and this is also the case for more vulnerable populations, such as    children, elderly persons, or pregnant women. Combined interventions    (e.g., co-application of drugs, electrophysiological measurements,    neuroimaging) were not associated with further safety issues.\& para;\&    para;Safety is established for low-intensity `conventional' TES defined    as <4 mA, up to 60 min duration per day. Animal studies and modeling    evidence indicate that brain injury could occur at predicted current    densities in the brain of 6.3-13 Afin(2) that are over an order of    magnitude above those produced by tDCS in humans. Using AC stimulation    fewer AEs were reported compared to DC. In specific paradigms with    amplitudes of up to 10 mA, frequencies in the kHz range appear to be    safe.\& para;\& para;In this paper we provide structured interviews and    recommend their use in future controlled studies, in particular when    trying to extend the parameters applied. We also discuss recent    regulatory issues, reporting practices and ethical issues.

Survivors of brain injury experience stigma and    challenges related to the misattribution of symptoms to other causes    that are significant barriers to recovery and adjustment. Changes in    policy and other large-scale interventions are cited as an    underexplored, yet critical path to reducing the impact of brain injury.    The present study sought to comprehensively characterize the impact of    one such initiative-Brain Injury Identification Cards-among survivors to    further refine the resource. Research Method/Design: In this    cross-sectional qualitative focus group study, we recruited 16    individuals with a history of brain injury via email listservs of    individuals who registered for a Brain Injury Identification Card. We    used rapid data analysis with a hybrid of deductive and inductive    analytic strategies to identify themes within a priori domains. Results:    We extracted themes within four domains: (a) process and reasons for    obtaining cards; (b) overall impressions of the cards; (c) uses of the    cards; and (d) feedback and proposed changes. Participants described the    process of obtaining cards as straightforward and shared wide-ranging    benefits across domains, including improving survivors' sense of safety,    self-advocacy, and ability to participate in daily activities.

However, this technology encounters several challenges, and security is    one of them. Given that, authentication and verification of legitimate    devices with data privacy pose key concerns in a wireless communication    environment. Even though, the literature highlights the growing security    threats of this technology, where attackers can easily compromise the    existing authentication and data preservation schemes. Therefore, it is    crucial for all involved stakeholders to address these concerns using    Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL),    and Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms, as they offer cost-effective    solutions. While some algorithms have been used in the literature to    accurately and effectively predict, detect, and prevent vulnerabilities    in this technology, they may not adequately handle modern or advanced    security threats. Therefore, in this article, we provide a comprehensive    survey of the existing literature from 2014 to 2022, specifically    focusing on AI, ML, DL, and RL-enabled prototypes. Our goal is to    highlight the contributions and limitations of the considered articles.

It helps the users to share knowledge and to exchange    viewpoints, and also to represent themselves in interactive online    communities and to connect other users with common interests. OSN has    transformed users' social domain into commercial space. It generates a    problem around privacy and protection for OSN users. The OSN service    providers store their consumers' private and confidential data securely,    and sometimes it may be misused by data administrators, third parties,    or unauthorized users. In this article, the trend of social networking    websites aims to review and analyse these types of cyber threats of SN    and develop measures to shield the identity in cyberspace, i.e., the    security of non-public data and identity in social networks is studied.

"Huang, Ching-Yu",An Integrated Mechanism for Resetting Passwords in Web Applications,,2017,,,50-54,,"It is very common for people to forget their passwords and request to    reset their password through web browsers. This leads to the critical    question of how a software developer should simply and safely, store and    change a user's password for a web application. When an application    stores a user's password in a database, the password must be encrypted    so nobody can query the fields and see the original value. It is bad    design to send or display the original password to the user when a user    resets their password, as the information could be seen or intercepted.    On the other hand, it is also inconvenient that users must memorize    additional information in the form of security questions when attempting    to reset the password. When resetting a password, it is better to use a    user's basic personal information and email or text them a reset URL    link with encrypted codes. This paper presents an integrated mechanism    that utilizes PHP and MySQL functions to reset user passwords and    improve the security for resetting passwords. The method can also    protect the database from being attacked by reducing unnecessary access    to the database.

Practices collected monthly    data on: net revenue, no-show rates, total encounters, and number of    encounters for young children and pregnant women. We analyzed    quantitative data using paired t-tests before and after the    collaborative and collected supplemental qualitative feedback from    clinic staff through focus groups and directed email. Results All mean    measures improved, including: higher monthly revenue (\$28,380-\$33,102,    p = 0.37), decreased no-show rate (17.7-14.3\%, p = 0.11), higher    monthly dental health encounters (283-328, p = 0.08), and higher monthly    encounters for young children (8.8-10.5, p = 0.65), and pregnant women    (2.8-9.7, p = 0.29). Results varied by practice, with some demonstrating    largest increases in encounters for young children and others pregnant    women. Focus group participants reported that the collaborative improved    access for pregnant women and young children, and that QI methods were    often new and difficult. Conclusion for practice Participation by safety    net dental practices in a QI collaborative is feasible and acceptable.    Individual sites saw greater improvements in different outcomes areas,    based on their own structures and needs. Future efforts should focus on    specific needs of each dental practice and should offer additional QI    training.",SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",Article,English,"Vander Schaaf, EB (Corresponding Author), Populat Hlth Improvement Partners, Morrisville, NC USA.

We performed longitudinal entomological and    epidemiological surveys in households along a 1900 x 125 m transect of    Arequipa, Peru, a major city of nearly one million inhabitants, in which    the transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi, the aetiological agent of Chagas    disease, by the insect vector Triatoma infestans, is an ongoing problem.    The transect spans a cline of urban development from established    communities to land invasions. We find that the vector is tracking the    development of the city, and the parasite, in turn, is tracking the    dispersal of the vector. New urbanizations are free of vector    infestation for decades. T. cruzi transmission is very recent and    concentrated in more established communities. The increase in land    tenure security during the course of urbanization, if not accompanied by    reasonable and enforceable zoning codes, initiates an influx of    construction materials, people and animals that creates fertile    conditions for epidemics of some vector-borne diseases.",ROYAL SOC,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Levy, MZ (Corresponding Author), Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Dept Biostat \& Epidemiol, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.

Despite advancements, the undesirable    generation of these models remains a critical concern, particularly due    to vulnerabilities exposed by text-based jailbreak attacks, which have    represented a significant threat by challenging existing safety    protocols. Motivated by the unique security risks posed by the    integration of new and old modalities for MLLMs, we propose a unified    multimodal universal jailbreak attack framework that leverages iterative    image-text interactions and transfer-based strategy to generate a    universal adversarial suffix and image. Our work not only highlights the    interaction of image-text modalities can be used as a critical    vulnerability but also validates that multimodal universal jailbreak    attacks can bring higher-quality undesirable generations across    different MLLMs. We evaluate the undesirable context generation of MLLMs    like LLaVA, Yi-VL, MiniGPT4, MiniGPT-v2, and InstructBLIP, and reveal    significant multimodal safety alignment issues, highlighting the    inadequacy of current safety mechanisms against sophisticated multimodal    attacks.

IEEE,SAWBRID: SmArt WhiteBoard Replacement Interactive Device,,2021,,,140-145,,"The idea of attending a professor's office hours seems very basic to the    average college student. The beginning of each semester brings about a    wave of invitations to visit each professor in their office, at the    allotted time for the section of their class. Recent developments such    as the growing prevalence of texting and email, as well as specific    events such as the Covid-19 pandemic have brought the norm away from    these in person meetings between students and professors, to the    detriment of the students' education. The SmArt WhiteBoard Replacement    Interactive Device (SAWBRID) is an innovative solution composed of an    interactive device with a Low-power screen that, through a user friendly    mobile application, makes the facilitation of office hours and the    student/professor interactions outside of the classroom far more    flexible and simple. In whole, the project is centered around the    individual professor, their schedule, and how that schedule is    communicated. The SAWBRID sits in an accessible casing outside of the    professor's office, relaying information about their schedule, available    time slots to be scheduled through the mobile application, and    personalized messages. The device is self-updating whenever a change is    detected in the professor's schedule, or when they decide to update    their personalized message. The student can access a professor's    schedule through the mobile application and schedule an appointment,    which will place their initials in the selected time slot on both the    mobile application and the SAWBRID. The professor has a different    interface to interact with their SAWBRID from the mobile application    giving them more control over their schedule, the personalized messages    they want to display and other features. We use security services such    as confidentiality and authentication throughout the system to protect    user credentials, user data, and to ensure the privacy of the users. Our    solution effectiveness and performance are evaluated through power    measurements to determine the device's ability to self-sustain for long    periods of time and the ease of use.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Beasley, J (Corresponding Author), James Madison Univ, Sch Integrated Sci, Harrisonburg, VA 22807 USA.

We sought to understand how the pandemic has    exacerbated preexisting patient safety issues and created novel patient    safety challenges in ICUs in the United States. Method We performed a    national, multi-institutional, mixed-methods survey of critical care    clinicians to elicit experiences related to patient safety during the    pandemic. The survey was disseminated via email through the Society of    Critical Care Medicine listserv. Data were reported as valid    percentages, compared by COVID caseload and peak of the pandemic;    free-text responses were analyzed and coded for themes. Results We    received 335 survey responses. On general patient safety, 61\% felt that    conditions were more hazardous when compared with the prepandemic    period. Those who took care of mostly COVID-19 patients were more likely    to perceive that care was more hazardous (odds ratio, 4.89; 95\% CI,    2.49-9.59) compared with those who took care of mostly non-COVID-19 or    no COVID-19 patients. In free-text responses, providers identified    patient safety risks related to pandemic adaptations, such as    ventilator-related lung injury, medication and diagnostic errors,    oversedation, oxygen device removal, and falls. Conclusions Increased    COVID-19 case burden was significantly associated with perceptions of a    less safe patient care environment by frontline ICU clinicians.

Fog computing offers solutions to those limitations;    nevertheless, owning to its intrinsic distributed architecture, it faces    challenges in the form of security of fog devices, secure authentication    and privacy. Blockchain technology has been utilised to offer solutions    for the authentication and security challenges in fog systems. This    paper proposes an authentication system that utilises the    characteristics and advantages of blockchain and smart contracts to    authenticate users securely. The implemented system uses the email    address, username, Ethereum address, password and data from a biometric    reader to register and authenticate users. Experiments showed that the    proposed method is secure and achieved performance improvement when    compared to existing methods.

Charging stations    (CSs) utilize electric vehicles (EVs) to manage demand response and    provide sustainable energy solutions. However, the transmission of    information between EVs and CSs via public channels causes critical    security vulnerabilities. Although much effort has been made to overcome    the challenge of protecting security and privacy in V2G environments,    these efforts have either been proposed based on a centralized    architecture or do not ensure essential security requirements, such as    self-sovereignty, reliable, and blockchain scalability. Furthermore, in    decentralized network, it is difficult to provide reliable energy    distribution because a malicious participant can easily try to inflate    trading volumes and manipulate energy prices. In this paper, we propose    a new blockchain-enabled, reliable, privacy-preserving scheme using    decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for preventing energy wash trading in    V2G networks called BAPS-DITS. BAPS-DITS guarantees to tackle the above    challenges without a trusted third-party intervention. Additionally, we    use informal and formal (mathematical) analysis to prove the security of    BAPS-DITS and conduct a comparative analysis comparing the security    properties, computational cost, and communication cost of BAPS-DITS to    previous studies. Furthermore, we implement BAPS-DITS on a practical    Ethereum network, demonstrating its efficiency and feasibility, showing    that BAPS-DITS provides self-sovereignty, accountability, and blockchain    scalability; thus, it is suitable for actual V2G environments.",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Article,English,"Park, Y (Corresponding Author), Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Elect \& Elect Engn, Daegu 41566, South Korea.

In TPH-UOKM, a    group of key servers share a user-specific secret key for a user, and    assist the user in producing her/his password-derived private key in a    threshold and oblivious way, where the password is hardened to resist    offline dictionary guessing attacks. Anyone can outsource data protected    with the user's password-derived public key to the cloud server, and    merely the user holding the correct password can recover the    password-derived private key for data access. TPH-UOKM can accomplish    decryption of N ciphertexts with the complexity \$O(1)\$ of    communication between a user and the key servers, which outperforms    existing schemes. TPH-UOKM supports password update. The cloud server    can update all protected data of a user with an update token to be    accessible only with the new password, which resists password leakage.    We present a two-level proactivization mechanism to periodically update    user-specific secret key shares and the key servers to thwart perpetual    compromise of them, where the renewal of user-specific secret key shares    reduces computation and communication costs compared to existing    approaches.

IEEE,Implement Time Based One Time Password and Secure Hash Algorithm 1 for    Security of Website Login Authentication,,2019,,,115-119,,"The use of information systems is a solutions to support the operations    of the institution. In order to access information systems in accordance    with their access rights, usually the user will enter a username and    password as the authentication process. However, this has a weakness if    the other side is cheating by sniffing or tapping user passwords. This    makes the password unsafe to use for access information systems. If the    username and password if it is stolen, abuse will occur for the crime or    theft of the owner's identity accounts like name, email, telephone    number, biological mother's name, account number and others. One    solution is to apply two factor authentication method which is    Time-Based One Time Password (TOTP) and Secure Algorithm Hash Algorithm    1 (SHA1). With this method, the system Authentication of a website or    site does not only depend on the username and password to enter the    account user but the user will get a token or code which is used to log    in to the user's account. After testing hundred times, the    authentication process who use Two Factor Authentication can tackle    possible attacks on abuse o user access rights. Time Based Application    One Time Password and Secure Hash Algorithm 1 Generate code that can't    be the same because of the code it can only be used once with a time    limit certain so it is difficult to guess. SHA1 with long input    different strings will produce output with a fixed length string of 160    bits. Test results are obtained the results that 30 seconds is enough to    prevent hackers log in and take over the account without permission and    also prove that two-factor authentication can increase the security of    the authentication process well. The time above is the result of testing    the process user authentication until the hacker sniffing against tokens    to try to take over the account.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Seta, H (Corresponding Author), Univ Pembangunan Nas Vet Jakarta, Jakarta, Indonesia.

Methods: Individuals with CP and their family members were invited to    participate in the web-based survey via email (NSW/ACT CP Register) or    via posts on social media by Cerebral Palsy Alliance, CP Research    Network, and CP Now. Survey responses included yes/no/unsure, multiple    choices, and Likert scales. Fisher's exact and chi(2) tests were used to    assess if there were significant differences between subgroups. Results:    Individuals with CP and their families (n = 145) were willing to    participate in genomics research (68\%), data sharing (82\%), and    biobanking efforts (75\%). This willingness to participate was    associated with completion of tertiary education, previous genetic    testing experience, overall higher genomic awareness, and trust in    international researchers. The survey respondents also expressed ongoing    communication and diverse information needs regarding the use of their    samples and data. Major concerns were associated with privacy and data    security. Discussion: The success of genomic research and international    data sharing efforts in CP are contingent upon broad support and    recruitment. Ongoing consultation and engagement of individuals with CP    and their families will facilitate trust and promote increased awareness    of genomics in CP that may in turn maximize participant uptake and    recruitment.",KARGER,"ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Article; Early Access,English,"Wilson, YA (Corresponding Author), Univ Sydney, Fac Med \& Hlth, Discipline Child \& Adolescent Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia.

ACAD CONF LTD,Taxonomy of Social Engineering Attacks: A Survey of Trends and Future    Directions,,2022,,,185-193,,"Hackers have many techniques available for breaching the security flaws    of organizations. The human approach, called Social Engineering (SE), is    probably the most difficult one to be dealt with. Social engineering is    considered one of the most creative methods for gaining unauthorized    access to information systems. This type of cyber threat does not    require advanced technical knowledge because it relies mainly on human    nature. Social engineers use different techniques, such as phishing, to    manipulate people and cause significant damage to the organizations    where they work. Therefore, organizations must raise the awareness of    their users about social engineering attacks. Most organizations are    putting all defense efforts into advanced technologies to prevent    various threats. This is considered a wrong approach because employees    of an organization use email, social networks, or other online sites as    part of their work activities. Therefore, the prevention of attacks    cannot be accomplished through advanced technologies alone, but the    human aspect must also be studied. This paper comprehensively analyzes    the existing literature in the taxonomy of social engineering attacks    focusing on human aspects.

There are few adolescent-focused interventions designed to    educate them about opioid medication safety. The MedSMARxT: Adventures    in PharmaCity, is a serious educational video game that teaches parents    and their youths about safe opioid practices. Objective: This study    aimed to elucidate parent's perceptions of MedSMARxT: Adventures in    PharmaCity and its potential use by parents and their adolescents.    Methods: Parents of adolescents aged 12 to 18 years who live in the    United States were recruited from April to October 2021 via Qualtrics    research panels, social media, email listserves, and snowball sampling.    The study participants played MedSMARxT: Adventures in PharmaCity for 30    minutes and then participated in a 30-minute postgame interview via    WebEx (Cisco). Questions were developed and piloted to examine adults'    perceptions of the game. Participants were asked three sets of    open-ended questions: (1) questions about the game and elements of the    game, (2) what they learned from the game, and (3) questions about their    experience with games. Audio recordings were transcribed verbatim.    Interview transcripts were coded using content and thematic analysis by    study team members to identify major themes and subthemes from the data.    Results: Parent participants (N=67) played MedSMARxT: Adventures in    PharmaCity and completed a postgame interview. Analysis extrapolated    four primary themes from the data: (1) participant gaming experience,    (2) perception of game features, (3) educational purpose of the game,    and (4) future use of the game. Most participants (n=56, 84\%), had at    least some experience with video games. More than half of the    participants (n=35, 52\%) participants, had positive reactions to the    game characters and scenes depicted in MedSMARxT: Adventures in    PharmaCity and stated they were realistic for adolescents. Most    participants (n=39, 58\%), would recommend the game to others.    Significant difficulties with gameplay navigation were reported by 38    (57\%) participants, as well as a slow game pace. All participants were    able to accurately identify the overarching goal of the game: opioid or    medication safety. The game reinforced existing knowledge for    participants, though many (n=15, 22\%), reported a new awareness of the    need to store opioid medications in a locked area and the availability    of medication disposal drop boxes at pharmacies. Participants stated    that they would recommend the game for future use by families and youths    in various health care and non-health care settings. Conclusions: The    use of a tailored serious game is a novel, engaging tool to educate    adolescents on opioid safety. MedSMARxT: Adventures in PharmaCity can be    used as a tool for parents and adolescents to facilitate meaningful    dialogue about safe and appropriate opioid use.","JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC","130 QUEENS QUAY East, Unit 1100, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",Article,English,"Abraham, O (Corresponding Author), Univ Wisconsin Madison, Sch Pharm, Social \& Adm Sci Div, Room 2515 Rennebohm Hall,777 Highland Ave, Madison, WI 53705 USA.

Hackers are    always looking for ways to breach the security of the internet. Good    researchers continuously develop solutions to the problems of breaches    in security. Human interaction proofs are also one of the most    affordable solutions to problems. The completely automated public Turing    test to tell computers and humans apart (CAPTCHA) has a wide range of    applications, including website authentication, preventing bogus email    registration, preventing bogus online polls, preventing bogus ticket    booking, and so on. CAPTCHAs come in various formats, but text-based    schemes are the most common. Unfortunately, these text-based CAPTCHAs    are available in foreign languages and have a high success rate. The    usability of these foreign language-based schemes for native people is    also very low. These days, Hindi CAPTCHAs are available, but before    using them, we must test the security of these schemes. In this study,    ten different coloured CAPTCHAs are broken using the k-nearest    neighbours, the support vector machine, and the random forest    classifiers. The breaking rate for two-colour schemes is 90\%, while the    breaking rate for multi-colour schemes is 93\%. The solving time for the    support vector machine and the random forest classifier ranges from 0.06    s to 0.09 s and 0.1 to 0.2 s in the case of two-colour schemes. For    multi-colour schemes, it ranges from 0.06 s to 0.09 s and 0.09 s to 0.2    s for the support vector machine and random forest classifier,    respectively.",SPRINGER,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Article,English,"Kumar, M (Corresponding Author), Maharaja Ranjit Singh Punjab Tech Univ, Dept Computat Sci, Bathinda, PB, India.

IEEE,Detecting SPIT calls by checking human communication patterns,,2007,,,1979-1984,,"SPam over Internet Telephony (SPIT) is expected to become a very serious    issue in the next years. The threat is going to spin out from the well    known email spam problem by bot nets being re-programmed to initiate not    just spam emails but also Voice over IP (VoIP) calls. Preventing SPIT is    a new problem, because many well-established methods for blocking email    spam cannot be applied. Currently, several SPIT prevention methods are    being proposed but SPIT prevention research is still at a very early    stage. In this paper, we propose an innovative way to detect SPIT calls    by comparing applying hidden Turing tests that compare them with typical    human communication patterns. For passing these tests, significant    resource consumptions at the SPIT generating hot nets would be required    which contradicts the spammer's objective of placing as many SPIT calls    as possible,    The proposed method has several advantages compared to other methods    that also interact with the caller.

This work proposes    ADVERT, a human-technical solution that generates adaptive visual aids    in real-time to prevent users from inadvertence and reduce their    susceptibility to phishing attacks. Based on the eye-tracking data, we    extract visual states and attention states as system-level sufficient    statistics to characterize the user's visual behaviors and attention    status. By adopting a data-driven approach and two learning feedback of    different time scales, this work lays out a theoretical foundation to    analyze, evaluate, and particularly modify humans' attention processes    while they vet and recognize phishing emails. We corroborate the    effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of ADVERT through a case study    based on the data set collected from human subject experiments conducted    at New York University. The results show that the visual aids can    statistically increase the attention level and improve the accuracy of    phishing recognition from 74.6\% to a minimum of 86\%.

In 2008, it was estimated that phishing    resulted in close to \$50 billion in damages to U.S. consumers and    businesses. Even so, research has yet to explore many of the reasons why    Internet users continue to be exploited. The goal of this paper is to    better understand the behavioral factors that may increase one's    susceptibility for complying with a phisher's request for personal    information. Using past research on deception detection, a research    model was developed to help explain compliant phishing responses. The    model was tested using a field study in which each participant received    a phishing e-mail asking for sensitive information. It was found that    four behavioral factors were influential as to whether the phishing    e-mails were answered with sensitive information. The paper concludes by    suggesting that the behavioral aspect of susceptible users be integrated    into the current tools and materials used in antiphishing efforts.","ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR \& FRANCIS LTD","2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Wright, RT (Corresponding Author), Univ San Francisco, Dept Technol Innovat \& Entrepreneurship, San Francisco, CA 94117 USA.

As every single article on this planet is being digitalized    quickly, it is more important to protect those items. Numerous cyber    threats effectively deceive ordinary individuals to take away their    identifications. Phishing is a kind of social engineering attack where    the hackers are using this kind of attack in modern days to steal the    user's credentials. After a systematic research analysis of phishing    technique and email scam, an intrusion detection system in chrome    extension is developed. This technique is used to detect real-time    phishing by examining the URL, domain, content and page attributes of an    URL prevailing in an email and any web page portion. Considering the    reliability, robustness and scalability of an efficient phishing    detection system, we designed a lightweight and proactive rule-based    incremental construction approach to detect any unknown phishing URLs.    Due to the computational intelligence and nondependent of the blacklist    signatures, this application can detect the zero-day and spear phishing    attacks with a detection rate of 89.12\% and 76.2\%, respectively. The    true positive values acquired in our method is 97.13\% and it shows less    than 1.5\% of false positive values.

The existing security    mechanisms, though effective, often fall short in addressing advanced    and evolving intrusion techniques. This motivates the need for a more    robust, efficient, and intelligent access control system that can not    only detect intrusions but also prevent unauthorized access in    real-time. This study proposes an Optimized Dual Access Control    mechanism for secure cloud-based data storage and distribution using    Global-Context Residual Recurrent Neural Network (DACGCRRNN-FOFMOA-CDS).    This novel approach aims to enhance both data protection and access    management in cloud environments. The proposed methodology contains    three distinct phases: (i) registration phase, (ii) intrusion detection    phase, (iii) intrusion prevention phase. During the registration phase,    user credentials are created for secure data uploads. The data undergoes    pre-processing in the intrusion detection phase, where redundant and    noisy information is filtered out using Poisson Multi-Bernoulli Mixture    Filtering (PMBMF). This ensures data normalization and sanitization,    preparing it for the classification process. The core of this process    involves the use of the Global-Context Residual Recurrent Neural Network    (GCRRNN), which automatically classifies users as legitimate or    unauthorized. To further enhance classification accuracy, the GCRRNN is    optimized using the Fractional-Order Fish Migration Optimization    Algorithm (FOFMOA). The intrusion prevention phase involves verifying    user identity through login credentials, ensuring robust protection    against unauthorized access. The effectiveness of the proposed    DAC-GCRRNN-FOFMOA-CDS model is validated using the Enron Email Database,    and its performance is measured through key metrics like sensitivity,    precision, F-score, specificity, error rate, accuracy, and ROC curve    analysis. The proposed method attains 23.98 \%, 21 \%, 29\% higher    accuracy, 27.94\%, 21.09\%, 30\% higher precision, 10.87 \%, 17.98 \%,    22 \% lower error rate compared with the existing techniques.",ELSEVIER ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY,"OXFORD FULFILLMENT CENTRE THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON,    OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Rafi, SM (Corresponding Author), Bharath Inst Higher Educ \& Res, Dept Comp Sci \& Engn, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.

ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,Combatting Senior Scams Using a Large Language Model-Created Rubric,,2024,,,130-136,,"This paper addresses the critical issue of internet scams targeting    seniors by developing a robust, Machine Learning (ML) based solution    employing a Large Language Model (LLM), specifically ChatGPT, to enhance    scam detection and prevention. Elderly internet users are particularly    vulnerable to digital fraud due to a lack of familiarity with    technological safeguards and a tendency not to report incidents.    Traditional security measures often fail to accommodate the unique    challenges faced by this demographic, prompting our focus on a    specialized, user-friendly solution. We propose an innovative approach    using ChatGPT 3.5 to analyze and score emails based on their likelihood    of being scams, thus providing seniors with a tool that requires minimal    interaction while offering maximum protection. This system uses a custom    rubric developed through ML techniques to evaluate potential threats    effectively. By integrating word embeddings and a diverse training    dataset, the model adapts to the nuanced and evolving nature of scam    tactics. The methodology utilized in this paper ensures that the ML    model not only identifies common scam indicators but also provides    actionable feedback to users, making it a practical tool for real-world    applications. Preliminary results demonstrate the system's efficacy in    recognizing scam emails, thereby significantly reducing the risk of    financial loss among seniors and enhancing their confidence in digital    communication.

However, most currently proposed anonymous    routing protocols are primarily designed for networks with stable    connections, making it challenging to protect user identities in MONs.    To address these challenges, we propose FLAG-POR (Forward Legal    Anonymous Group Pairing-Onion Routing), a novel anonymous routing    protocol specifically tailored to enhance message delivery anonymity and    security in MONs. Specifically, we abstract the mobile opportunistic    network as a contact graph. By introducing the concept of ``groups{''}    into the pairing-onion routing protocol, which encrypts messages and    relay nodes layer by layer, we develop a novel group-based pairing-onion    routing protocol. This protocol ensures message confidentiality and    relay node anonymity, while also improving message forwarding rates, as    any node within a group can potentially act as a relay. To ensure    message authenticity, we employ the efficient SM2 signing algorithm to    generate signatures for the message source. Furthermore, by    incorporating parameters such as the public key validity period and    master key validity period into the group pairing-onion routing    protocol, we achieve forward security in message delivery.

Digital    signature plays an important role to ensure authentication,    non-integrity and non-repudiation on a message. Digital signature can be    computed using RSA, DSA and elliptic curve cryptography. It can be    simple signature in which hash of the message is encrypted with the    private key of the sender. This private key and corresponding public    keys are generated by CA, and public key are bind in the digital    certificate. Another approach is Identity Based (ID) signature in which    private keys are generated by PKG and public key is derived from the    user's identity. This is also known as certificate less communication.    In ID based signature, there is no need to transmit public key over    unsecure channel. Public keys are efficiently derived from the    receiver's identity information such as name, email address, network    address, IP address and now aadhar number. Email address can be forged    by unauthorized persons. Today aadhar number is used as unique identity    proof that can be used as ID to derive public key of the user. In this    paper we have used aadhar number to propose an efficient and secure    identity based multiple signature schemes using RSA.

"Birney, Amelia J. and Gunn, Rebecca and Russell, Jeremy K. and Ary,    Dennis V.",MoodHacker Mobile Web App With Email for Adults to Self-Manage    Mild-to-Moderate Depression: Randomized Controlled Trial,JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,2016,4,e8,100-118,JAN-MAR,"Background: Worldwide, depression is rated as the fourth leading cause    of disease burden and is projected to be the second leading cause of    disability by 2020. Annual depression-related costs in the United States    are estimated at US \$210.5 billion, with employers bearing over 50\% of    these costs in productivity loss, absenteeism, and disability. Because    most adults with depression never receive treatment, there is a need to    develop effective interventions that can be more widely disseminated    through new channels, such as employee assistance programs (EAPs), and    directly to individuals who will not seek face-to-face care.    Objective: This study evaluated a self-guided intervention, using the    MoodHacker mobile Web app to activate the use of cognitive behavioral    therapy (CBT) skills in working adults with mild-to-moderate depression.    It was hypothesized that MoodHacker users would experience reduced    depression symptoms and negative cognitions, and increased behavioral    activation, knowledge of depression, and functioning in the workplace.    Methods: A parallel two-group randomized controlled trial was conducted    with 300 employed adults exhibiting mild-to-moderate depression.    Participants were recruited from August 2012 through April 2013 in    partnership with an EAP and with outreach through a variety of    additional non-EAP organizations. Participants were blocked on    race/ethnicity and then randomly assigned within each block to receive,    without clinical support, either the MoodHacker intervention (n=150) or    alternative care consisting of links to vetted websites on depression    (n=150). Participants in both groups completed online self-assessment    surveys at baseline, 6 weeks after baseline, and 10 weeks after    baseline. Surveys assessed (1) depression symptoms, (2) behavioral    activation, (3) negative thoughts, (4) worksite outcomes, (5) depression    knowledge, and (6) user satisfaction and usability. After randomization,    all interactions with subjects were automated with the exception of    safety-related follow-up calls to subjects reporting current suicidal    ideation and/or severe depression symptoms.    Results: At 6-week follow-up, significant effects were found on    depression, behavioral activation, negative thoughts, knowledge, work    productivity, work absence, and workplace distress. MoodHacker yielded    significant effects on depression symptoms, work productivity, work    absence, and workplace distress for those who reported access to an EAP,    but no significant effects on these outcome measures for those without    EAP access. Participants in the treatment arm used the MoodHacker app an    average of 16.0 times (SD 13.3), totaling an average of 1.3 hours (SD    1.3) of use between pretest and 6-week follow-up. Significant effects on    work absence in those with EAP access persisted at 10-week follow-up.    Conclusions: This randomized effectiveness trial found that the    MoodHacker app produced significant effects on depression symptoms    (partial eta(2) = .021) among employed adults at 6-week follow-up when    compared to subjects with access to relevant depression Internet sites.    The app had stronger effects for individuals with access to an EAP    (partial eta(2) = .093). For all users, the MoodHacker program also    yielded greater improvement on work absence, as well as the mediating    factors of behavioral activation, negative thoughts, and knowledge of    depression self-care. Significant effects were maintained at 10-week    follow-up for work absence. General attenuation of effects at 10-week    follow-up underscores the importance of extending program contacts to    maintain user engagement. This study suggests that light-touch,    CBT-based mobile interventions like MoodHacker may be appropriate for    implementation within EAPs and similar environments. In addition, it    seems likely that supporting MoodHacker users with guidance from    counselors may improve effectiveness for those who seek in-person    support.","JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC","130 QUEENS QUAY East, Unit 1100, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",Article,English,"Birney, AJ (Corresponding Author), ORCAS, POB 1226, Eugene, OR 97440 USA.

The way to establish trust between devices and    authenticate these networks depends completely on the scenario. In Body    Area Networks human biometrics can serve as a shared secret among    devices. In real-time voice communication, the ZRTP protocol allows for    interactive trust establishment by recognizing the peer's voice. In    asynchronous networks, such as email, other interactive mechanisms have    been deployed, such as key fingerprint verification.    In our research, we are analyzing the security and usability of existing    trust mechanisms for heterogeneous networks. Furthermore, we are    proposing protocol changes and new mechanisms to establish trust between    devices. In this paper an overview is given over existing and upcoming    research in this area. For synchronous networks, human biometrics, such    as human gait or a peer's voice, are used as trust anchors.

This paper introduces a novel approach for cryptographic message    authentication where this problem does not arise: A linkable message    tagging scheme (LMT) identifies pairs of messages and accompanying    authentication tags as related if and only if these tags were created    using the same secret key. Importantly, our primitive fully avoids    public keys, and hence elegantly sidesteps the key distribution problem    of signature schemes.    As an application of LMT we envision an email authentication system with    minimal user interaction. Email clients could routinely equip all    outgoing messages with corresponding tags and verify for incoming    messages whether they indeed originate from the same entity as    previously or subsequently received messages with identical sender    address.    As technical contributions we formalize the notions of LMT and its (more    efficient) variant CMT (classifiable message tagging), including    corresponding notions of unforgeability.

To find out how language and    social network structure interlink, we studied communication on Twitter,    a broadly-used online messaging service.    Results: We show that the network emerging from user communication can    be structured into a hierarchy of communities, and that the frequencies    of words used within those communities closely replicate this pattern.    Consequently, communities can be characterised by their most    significantly used words. The words used by an individual user, in turn,    can be used to predict the community of which that user is a member.    Conclusions: This indicates a relationship between human language and    social networks, and suggests that the study of online communication    offers vast potential for understanding the fabric of human society.

Venkateshwara",Blockchain-Based Digital Identity Management System for Cybersecurity,,2025,1273,,277-289,,"Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution for enhancing    the security and integrity of various applications, including identity    management systems. This research paper presents the design and    implementation of an Identity Management System (IMS) using the Solidity    programming language and the Ethereum blockchain platform. The IMS    allows users to register and manage their identities in a secure and    decentralized manner. The system employs a struct-based data structure    to store user identity information, including name, email, age, and    verification status. The functionalities of registering an identity,    verifying an identity, and retrieving identity information are    implemented as smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The paper    discusses the advantages of using blockchain technology for identity    management, such as immutability, transparency, and enhanced security.    It also explores the potential applications of the IMS in sectors like    finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. The research findings demonstrate    the feasibility and effectiveness of blockchain-based identity    management systems in mitigating identity fraud and unauthorized access.    Future research directions and challenges for scaling and    interoperability are also discussed, highlighting the need for    standardization and integration with existing identity frameworks. The    IMS serves as a foundation for further research and development in the    field of blockchain-based identity management, paving the way for more    secure and user-centric digital identities in the era of decentralized    systems.",SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,"152 BEACH ROAD, \#21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",Proceedings Paper,English,"Prashanth, MS (Corresponding Author), Vardhaman Coll Engn, Dept Comp Sci \& Engn, Hyderabad, India.

"Zhao, Yi and Ning, Jianting and Liang, Kaitai and Zhao, Yanqi and Chen,    Liqun and Yang, Bo",Privacy preserving search services against online attack,COMPUTERS \& SECURITY,2020,95,101836,,AUG,"Searchable functionality is provided in many online services such as    mail services or outsourced data storage. To protect users privacy, data    in these services is usually stored after being encrypted using    searchable encryption. This enables the data user to securely search    encrypted data from a remote server without leaking data and query    information. Public key encryption with keyword search is one of the    research branches of searchable encryption; this provides    privacy-preserving searchable functionality for applications such as    encrypted email systems. However, it has an inherent vulnerability in    that the information of a query may be leaked using a keyword guessing    attack. Most of existing works aim to make the system resistant to    offline keyword guessing, but this does not protect against online    attacks on real world services. In this paper, we move a step forward to    present a generic framework able to resist online keyword guessing    attack using a server-assisted model. Specifically, we design a novel    primitive C mirrored all-but-one lossy encryption, which can prevent a    specific user from generating valid encryptions. This primitive can be    seen as an access control on encryption ability. Combining searchable    encryption technique with the new primitive makes online keyword    guessing attack impossible for the specified user, even if the attack is    launched online. We further give formal security analysis for the    generic framework, and a concrete implementation with efficiency    analysis to show that our design is practical. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: A qualitative research study was conducted    utilizing semi-structured interviews with persons (N=15) who    self-identified as being involved in the development and/or the delivery    of simulations related to equity, diversity, and/or inclusion.    Participants were recruited via email using internal and public lists    for standardized patient programs and through snowball sampling.    Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim and transcripts were    analyzed qualitatively in an iterative coding process, anchored by    direct content analysis methodology, and informed by three theoretical    perspectives: the standardized patient journey, psychological safety,    and empowerment theory. Results: We constructed three main themes: (1)    safety should be prioritized throughout the journey; (2) empowerment is    key to engagement; and (3) standardized patient trainers are central    connectors for safety and empowerment. Conclusions: Through the    perspectives of standardized patients, this study has provided insight    on strategies to engage and support those participating in    equity-seeking simulations. Focused attention on safety and empowerment    is warranted, with trainers having a critical role in empowering    standardized patients to succeed in equity-seeking simulations.

Identity-based signatures can reduce the    complexity and the cost for managing the public key because the public    key is replaced by any known information of a user's identity. In this    paper, we discuss a new issue related to integrating forward-secure and    identity-based primitives into standard applications of personal network    communication security such as pretty good privacy suite and    secure/multipurpose internet mail extensions in which the secret key is    additionally protected by an extra secret that is possibly derived from    a password. One major contribution of this paper is to construct the    first forward-secure identity-based signature scheme in untrusted update    environments. In this scheme, the public key can be derived from some    arbitrary identification value such as an email address or a phone    number, and the signing key is additionally shielded by a second factor    derived from a user's password. Key update can be completed by the    encrypted version of signing keys. The second factor is only needed when    the signatures are produced. In addition, we give the definitions of    forward security and update security in this kind of signature.

Frequently, these leaks    contain only the passwords themselves, or basic information such as    usemames or email addresses. While metadata-rich leaks exist, they are    often limited in the variety of demographics they cover.    In this work, we analyze a meta-data rich data leak from a Middle    Eastern bank,with a demographically-diverse user base. We provide an    analysis of passwords created by groups of people of different cultural    backgrounds, some of which are under-represented in existing data leaks,    e.g., Arab, Filipino, Indian, and Pakistani.    The contributions provided by this work are many-fold. First, our    results contribute to the existing body of knowledge regarding how users    include personal information in their passwords. Second, we illustrate    the differences that exist in how users from different    cultural/linguistic backgrounds create passwords. Finally, we study the    (empirical and theoretical) guessability of the dataset based on two    attacker models, and show that a state of the art password strength    estimator inflates the strength of passwords created by users from    nonEnglish speaking backgrounds. We improve its estimations by training    it with contextually relevant information. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, to the best of our knowledge, all the    existing solutions still fail to protect users' privacy under coercion.    That is, the user's communication transcripts might be tracked and    cached, and later coerced to reveal the underlying messages associated    with the ciphertexts due to law enforcement reasons or for evil    purposes. In addition, anonymity alone is not enough for some practical    scenarios. For instance, a journalist just wants to communicate with    those intended informants, and thereby gather information from anonymous    but authenticated sources. In this paper, to address the above-mentioned    issues, we introduce an authenticated and deniable anonymous messaging    framework. Its core component is a new cryptographic primitive dubbed    deniable identity-based matchmaking encryption (DIB-ME), which captures    plausible deniability under coercion and mutual authentication without    interactions simultaneously.

IEEE,Multi-Factor Authentication to Systems Login,,2021,,,1092-1095,,"Multi-Factor Authentication is an electronic authentication method in    which a computer user is granted access to an application or a website    only after successfully presenting two or more factors, or pieces of    evidence. It is the first step to protect systems against intruders    since the traditional log-in methods (username and password) are not    completely protected from hackers, since they can guess them easily.    using tools. Current Systems use additional methods to increase    security, such as using two-factor authentication based on a one-time    password via mobile or email, or authentication based on biometrics    (fingerprint, eye iris or retina, and face recognition) or via token    devices. However, these methods require additional hardware equipment    with high cost at the level of small and medium companies. This paper    proposes a multi-factor authentication system that combines ease of use    and low-cost factors. The system does not need any special settings or    infrastructure. It relies on graphical passwords, so the user, in    registration phase, chooses three images and memorizes them. In the    login phase, the user needs only to choose the correct images that he    considered during the registration process in a specific order. The    proposed system overcomes many different security threats, such as    key-loggers, screen capture attack or shoulder surfing. The proposed    method was applied to 170 participants, 75\% of them are males and 25\%    are females, classified according to their age, education level, web    experience.

ACM,A Real World Study on Employees' Susceptibility to Phishing Attacks,,2020,,A4,,,"Phishing email attacks have been around for fifteen years but they are    still among the top security risks faced by organisations. The most    common approach to mitigate these attacks is employees' education and    awareness. Employees' awareness on phishing attacks is achieved by    embedded training that educate employees when they fall for the attack.    However, the effectiveness of embedded training in workplace settings is    uncertain given the large number of employees that remain vulnerable to    phishing email attacks. Similarly, the role of persuasion techniques in    making employees vulnerable to phishing attacks is yet to be    investigated in the workplace settings. Therefore, in this paper we    investigate which persuasion technique between authority and urgency is    more effective in making employees susceptible to phishing, the relation    between employees' susceptibility and their demographic data, and the    effectiveness of embedded training in reducing employees' susceptibility    to phishing attacks. To this end, we conducted a real phishing study    with 191 employees of an Italian company.

Due to this    tremendous growth, there has been a significant increase in spam    traffic. Spam messes up user's inbox, consumes network resources and    spread worms and viruses. In this paper we study the characteristics of    spam and the technology used by spammers. In order to counter anti spam    technology, spammers change their mode of operation, therefore continues    evaluation of the characteristics of spam and spammers technology has    become mandatory. These evaluations help us to enhance the existing anti    spam technology and thereby help us to combat spam effectively. In order    to characterize spam, we collected four hundred thousand spam mails from    a corporate mail server for a period of 14 months from January 2006 to    February 2007. For analysis we classified spam based on attachment and    contents. We observed that spammers use software tools to send spam with    attachment. The main features of this software are hiding sender's    identity, randomly selecting text messages, identifying open relay    machines, mass mailing capability and defining spamming duration.    Spammers do not use spam software to send spam without attachment. From    our study we observed that, four years old heavy users email accounts    attract more spam than four years old light users mail accounts.    Relatively new email accounts which are 14 months old do not receive    spam. But in some special cases like DDoS attacks, we found that new    email accounts receive spam and 14 months old heavy users email accounts    have attracted more spam than 14 months old light users. We believe that    this analysis could be useful to develop more efficient anti spam    techniques.",SCIENCE \& ENGINEERING RESEARCH SUPPORT SOC,"RM 402, MAN-JE BLDG, 449-8 OJUNG-DONG, DAEDOEK-GU, DAEJON, 00000, SOUTH    KOREA",Article,English,"Nagamalai, D (Corresponding Author), Wireilla Net Solutions Inc, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.

Whilst delivering an online randomised    trial, we detected unusual recruitment activity. We describe our    approach to detecting and managing suspected fraud and share lessons for    researchers.MethodsOur trial investigated the single and combined    effects of different ways of presenting clinical audit and feedback.    Clinicians and managers who received feedback from one of five United    Kingdom national clinical audit programmes were emailed invitations that    contained a link to the trial website. After providing consent and    selecting their relevant audit, participants were randomised    automatically to different feedback versions. Immediately after viewing    their assigned feedback, participants completed a questionnaire and    could request a financial voucher by entering an email address. Email    addresses were not linked to trial data to preserve participant    anonymity. We actively monitored participant numbers, questionnaire    completions, and voucher claims.ResultsFollowing a rapid increase in    trial participation, we identified 268 new voucher claims from three    email addresses that we had reason to believe were linked. Further    scrutiny revealed duplicate trial completions and voucher requests from    24 email addresses. We immediately suspended the trial, improved    security measures, and went on to successfully complete the study.We    found a peak in questionnaires completed in less than 20 seconds during    a likely contamination period. Given that study and personal data were    not linked, we could not directly identify the trial data from the 268    duplicate entries within the 603 randomisations occurring during the    same period. We therefore excluded all 603 randomisations from the    primary analysis, which was consequently based on 638 randomisations. A    sensitivity analysis, including all 961 randomisations over the entire    study except for questionnaire completions of less than 20 seconds,    found only minor differences from the primary analysis.ConclusionOnline    studies offering incentives for participation are at risk of attempted    fraud. Systematic monitoring and analysis can help detect such activity.    Measures to protect study integrity include linking participant    identifiers to study data, balancing study security and ease of    participation, and safeguarding the allocation of participant    incentives.",BMC,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Willis, TA (Corresponding Author), Univ Leeds, Leeds Inst Hlth Sci, Worsley Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, England.

Data were obtained from the 2021    APhA/NASPA National State-Based Pharmacy Workplace Survey, launched in    the United States in April 2021. Promotion of the online survey to    pharmacists and pharmacy technicians was accomplished through social    media, email, and online periodicals. Responses continued to be received    through the end of 2021. A data file containing 6973 responses was    downloaded on 7 January 2022 for analysis. Qualitative thematic analysis    was applied for developing operational definitions and coding guidelines    for content analysis of the data. The patterns of responses for the    dependent variables were compared among community-based practice setting    types (chain, supermarket/mass merchandiser, and independent) and work    positions (manager, staff pharmacist, technician/clerk, and owner).    Chi-square analysis was used for determining statistically significant    differences. The findings showed that personnel working in    community-based pharmacies reported undesirable work environments and    work stress that affected their ability to perform assigned duties for    optimal patient care and ensure patient safety. Four work system    elements were identified that were both facilitators and barriers to the    ability to perform duties and ensure patient safety: (1) people, (2)    tasks, (3) technology/tools, and (4) organizational context.

Large-scale personal data integration can reveal user identity,    enabling new insights and earn revenue for the organizations. Similarly,    aggregation of Android app permissions by the app owning parent    organizations can also cause privacy leakage by revealing the user    profile. This work classifies risky personal data by proposing a threat    model on the large-scale app permission aggregation by the app    publishers and associated owners. A Google-play application programming    interface (API) assisted web app is developed that visualizes all the    permissions an app owner can collectively gather through multiple apps    released via several publishers. The work empirically validates the    performance of the risk model with two case studies. The top two Korean    app owners, seven publishers, 108 apps and 720 sets of permissions are    studied. With reasonable accuracy, the study finds the contact number,    biometric ID, address, social graph, human behavior, email, location and    unique ID as frequently exposed data.

To maintain the Quality of Service (QoS) in the    multi-hop networking schema, FANETs utilize the available resources    efficiently. However, due to open wireless boundary and high mobility of    the drones, the FANETs are vulnerable to malicious nodes that can    penetrate the network and, thus, pose serious security threats,    particularly at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer. Such    susceptibility compromises the network security and privacy and harms    the information exchange operation within the network. The attacker can    either transmit a large number of reservation requests to waste the    bandwidth, listen to the control messages, conduct power-efficient    jamming or falsify the information to manipulate the network control.    Therefore, secure access control and a key agreement mechanism are    required. The mechanism must utilize the two phases, i.e., node    authentication and key agreement, to counter the aforementioned attacks.    Our contribution, in this paper, is a certificate-based access control    and key agreement scheme, which is based on the technique of    Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography (HECC) and employs a    collision-resistant one-way cryptographic hash function. In order to    assess the viability and performance of the proposed scheme, we analyze    it using formal security analysis techniques, such as the Real-Or-Random    (ROR) model and Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and    Applications (AVISPA) tool. The scheme is also evaluated using the    informal security analysis technique, or the non-mathematical approach.

We    analyze existing PbTA schemes and reveal a potential threat:    vulnerability against perpetual credential leakage, in which    ``perpetual{''} adversaries could perpetually attempt to compromise    long-lived credential databases maintained by identity servers.    Compromising a threshold number of credential databases enables the    adversaries to launch offline dictionary guessing attacks (DGA) or    illegally obtain users' tokens. To address these issues, we first    propose a basic device-enhanced PbTA scheme (DE-PbTA), where an    auxiliary device collaborates with identity servers in hardening a    user's password during authentication, such that perpetual adversaries    cannot learn the password from compromised credentials via offline DGA.    Using the hardened password, a private key can be derived to decrypt    ciphertexts from identity servers for token construction, which protects    the user's tokens against perpetual adversaries. Then, we extend basic    DE-PbTA to support dynamic usage of multiple devices, where a user can    actively choose t' devices out of n' for authentication.

USENIX,Secure Account Recovery for a Privacy-Preserving Web Service,,2024,,,1993-2010,,"If a web service is so secure that it does not even know- and does not    want to know-the identity and contact info of its users, can it still    offer account recovery if a user forgets their password? This paper is    the culmination of the authors' work to design a cryptographic protocol    for account recovery for use by a prominent secure matching system: a    web-based service that allows survivors of sexual misconduct to become    aware of other survivors harmed by the same perpetrator. In such a    system, the list of account-holders must be safeguarded, even against    the service provider itself.    In this work, we design an account recovery system that, on the surface,    appears to follow the typical workflow: the user types in their email    address, receives an email containing a one-time link, and answers some    security questions. Behind the scenes, the defining feature of our    recovery system is that the service provider can perform email-based    account validation without knowing, or being able to learn, a list of    users' email addresses. Our construction uses standardized cryptography    for most components, and it has been deployed in production at the    secure matching system.    As a building block toward our main construction, we design a new    cryptographic primitive that may be of independent interest: an    oblivious pseudorandom function that can either have a fully-private    input or a partially-public input, and that reaches the same output    either way. This primitive allows us to perform online rate limiting for    account recovery attempts, without imposing a bound on the creation of    new accounts. We provide an open-source implementation of this primitive    and provide evaluation results showing that the end-to-end interaction    time takes 8.4-60.4 ms in fully-private input mode and 3.1-41.2 ms in    partially-public input mode.",USENIX ASSOC,"SUITE 215, 2560 NINTH ST, BERKELEY, CA 94710 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Little, R (Corresponding Author), Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.

ACM,Short Paper - What You See is Not What You Get: Leakage-Resilient    Password Entry Schemes for Smart Glasses.,,2017,,,327-333,,"Smart glasses are becoming popular for users to access various services    such as email. To protect these services, password-based user    authentication is widely used. Unfortunately, the password-based user    authentication has inherent vulnerability against password leakage. Many    efforts have been put on designing leakage-resilient password entry    schemes on PCs and mobile phones with traditional input equipment    including keyboards and touch screens. However, such traditional input    equipment is not available on smart glasses. Existing password entry on    smart glasses relies on additional PCs or mobile devices. Such solutions    force users to switch between different systems, which causes    interrupted experience and may lower the practicability and usability of    smart glasses. In this paper, we propose a series of leakage-resilient    password entry schemes on stand-alone smart glasses, which are gTapper,    gRotator, and gTalker. These schemes ensure no leakage in password entry    by breaking the correlation between the underlying password and the    interaction observable to adversaries. They are practical in the sense    that they only require a touch pad, a gyroscope, and a microphone which    are commonly available on smart glasses. The usability of the proposed    schemes is evaluated by user study under various test conditions which    are common in users' daily usage. The results of our user study reveal    that the proposed schemes are easy-to-use so that users enter their    passwords within moderate time, at high accuracy, and in various    situations.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Li, Y (Corresponding Author), Singapore Management Univ, Sch Informat Syst, Singapore, Singapore.

This manuscript describes a number of developments that could    contribute to this change and implement this in a stepwise roadmap that    can be applied for the evaluation of food and food ingredients.    The roadmap was evaluated in four case studies by using literature and    existing data. This preliminary evaluation was shown to be useful.    However, this experience should be extended by including examples where    experimental work needs to be included. To further implement these new    insights in toxicology and safety assessment for the area of food and    food ingredients, the recommendation is that stakeholders take action in    addressing gaps in our knowledge, e.g. with regard to the applicability    of the roadmap for mixtures and food matrices. Further development of    the threshold of toxicological concern is needed, as well as cooperation    with other sectors where similar schemes are under development.    Moreover, a more comprehensive evaluation of the roadmap, also including    the identification of the need for in vitro experimental work is    recommended. (C) 2016 ILSI Europe.

"Molinaro, Kylie A. and Bolton, Matthew L.",Evaluating the applicability of the double system lens model to the    analysis of phishing email judgments,COMPUTERS \& SECURITY,2018,77,,128-137,AUG,"Phishing emails pose a serious threat to cybersecurity. Because human    users are the last line of defense, understanding how users identify    phishing emails is imperative to addressing this problem. Judgment    analysis (JA) provides a means of analyzing both how information in the    environment (cues) contributes to an outcome and how users synthesize    cues into judgments about that outcome, typically using multiple linear    regression. Because JA has not been applied to this domain, this effort    assessed if the statistical assumptions of JA with multiple linear    regression are upheld. We hypothesized that phishing cues are linearly    combinable, meaning a lens model analysis, a type of JA, is appropriate    for evaluating phishing judgments. To test this, we analyzed ten    participants who judged whether or not emails were phishing using the    double system lens model. Results indicated that the lens model is an    appropriate means of analyzing phishing judgments, primarily evidenced    by the goodness of fits for both the environment model and human    judgment models. We also observed varying achievement scores across    participants consistent with their varying levels of performance in the    judgment task. We discuss our results and how future phishing judgment    research can utilize JA afforded analysis capabilities. (C) 2018    Elsevier Ltd.

Trialists and UK Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC)    Clinical Trials Units (CTUs) are increasingly exploring the use of    digital tools to identify, recruit and retain participants. The aim of    this UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) study was to    identify what digital tools are currently used by CTUs and understand    the performance characteristics required to be judged useful. Methods A    scoping of searches (and a survey with NIHR funding staff), a survey    with all 52 UKCRC CTUs and 16 qualitative interviews were conducted with    five stakeholder groups including trialists within CTUs, funders and    research participants. A purposive sampling approach was used to conduct    the qualitative interviews during March-June 2018. Qualitative data were    analysed using a content analysis and inductive approach. Results    Responses from 24 (46\%) CTUs identified that database-screening tools    were the most widely used digital tool for recruitment, with the    majority being considered effective. The reason (and to whom) these    tools were considered effective was in identifying potential    participants (for both Site staff and CTU staff) and reaching    recruitment target (for CTU staff/CI). Fewer retention tools were used,    with short message service (SMS) or email reminders to participants    being the most reported. The qualitative interviews revealed five themes    across all groups: `security and transparency'; `inclusivity and    engagement'; `human interaction'; `obstacles and risks'; and `potential    benefits'. There was a high level of stakeholder acceptance of the use    of digital tools to support trials, despite the lack of evidence to    support them over more traditional techniques. Certain differences and    similarities between stakeholder groups demonstrated the complexity and    challenges of using digital tools for recruiting and retaining research    participants. Conclusions Our studies identified a range of digital    tools in use in recruitment and retention of RCTs, despite the lack of    high-quality evidence to support their use. Understanding the type of    digital tools in use to support recruitment and retention will help to    inform funders and the wider research community about their value and    relevance for future RCTs. Consideration of further focused digital tool    reviews and primary research will help to reduce gaps in the evidence    base.",BMC,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Griffiths, G (Corresponding Author), Univ Southampton, Southampton Clin Trials Unit, Southampton SO16 6YD, Hants, England.

Sender    authenticity can often be inferred from e-mail header information    commonly displayed by e-mail clients, such as sender and recipient    details. People may be biased by convincing e-mail content and overlook    these details, and subsequently fall for phishing. This study tests    whether people are better at detecting phishing e-mails when they are    only presented with user-facing e-mail headers, instead of full e-mails.    Results from a representative sample show that most phishing e-mails    were detected by less than 30\% of the participants, regardless of which    e-mail part was displayed. In fact, phishing detection was worst when    only e-mail headers were provided. Thus, people still fall for phishing,    because they do not recognize online impersonation tactics. No personal    traits, e-mail characteristics, nor URL interactions reliably predicted    phishing detection abilities.

IEEE,Certificateless Public Auditing for Data Integrity in the Cloud,,2013,,BA1QL,136-144,,"Due to the existence of security threats in the cloud, many mechanisms    have been proposed to allow a user to audit data integrity with the    public key of the data owner before utilizing cloud data. The    correctness of choosing the right public key in previous mechanisms    depends on the security of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and    certificates. Although traditional PKI has been widely used in the    construction of public key cryptography, it still faces many security    risks, especially in the aspect of managing certificates. In this paper,    we design a certificateless public auditing mechanism to eliminate the    security risks introduced by PKI in previous solutions. Specifically,    with our mechanism, a public verifier does not need to manage    certificates to choose the right public key for the auditing. Instead,    the auditing can be operated with the assistance of the data owner's    identity, such as her name or email address, which can ensure the right    public key is used. Meanwhile, this public verifier is still able to    audit data integrity without retrieving the entire data from the cloud    as previous solutions. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first    certificateless public auditing mechanism for verifying data integrity    in the cloud. Our theoretical analyses prove that our mechanism is    correct and secure, and our experimental results show that our mechanism    is able to audit the integrity of data in the cloud efficiently.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Wang, BY (Corresponding Author), Xidian Univ, State Key Lab Integrated Serv Networks, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.

Private spatial keyword-based positioning service is    promising in 6G-oriented IoT since it positions users based on spatial    locations and textual keywords while protecting user privacy. However,    due to economic benefits or malicious attacks, positioning service    providers may return erroneous or incomplete results, which cause    tremendous economic damage and security threats, e.g., always assigning    a selective driver for the specific car-hailing user. A technical    challenge for extending existing private schemes to enable users to    verify the correctness and completeness of positioning results is the    distinctive positioning paradigm between compared spatial locations and    matched textual keywords. This paper proposes a private and verifiable    spatial keyword positioning scheme named VSpatial in 6G-oriented IoT.    VSpatial enables users to verify the correctness and completeness of    spatial keyword-based positioning results while preserving user privacy.    The main inspiration for addressing the technical challenge is    converting both spatial locations and textual keywords into an internal    status, i.e., adapting comparison and matching to existence judging by    multiple cryptographic tools, such as hierarchical cube and pseudorandom    function. Based on this inspiration, we design a novel private    authenticated data structure (named PVTree), and then propose two    constructions of VSpatial, i.e., VSpatial-S and VSpatial-D, to suit    static and dynamic environments, respectively. The core idea for    adapting VSpatial-S to VSpatial-D is transferring one whole PVTree into    multiple exponential-size partitions. Security analysis proves the    security and verifiability of VSpatial. Theoretical and experimental    evaluations show that VSpatial achieves faster-than-linear positioning    efficiency and linear verification overhead.",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Article,English,"Zhang, C (Corresponding Author), Beijing Inst Technol, Sch Cyberspace Sci \& Technol, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.

ACM,Understanding Users' Interaction with Login Notifications,,2024,,,,,"Login notifications intend to inform users about sign-ins and help them    protect their accounts from unauthorized access. Notifications are    usually sent if a login deviates from previous ones, potentially    indicating malicious activity. They contain information like the    location, date, time, and device used to sign in. Users are challenged    to verify whether they recognize the login (because it was them or    someone they know) or to protect their account from unwanted access. In    a user study, we explore users' comprehension, reactions, and    expectations of login notifications. We utilize two treatments to    measure users' behavior in response to notifications sent for a login    they initiated or based on a malicious actor relying on statistical    sign-in information. We find that users identify legitimate logins but    need more support to halt malicious sign-ins. We discuss the identified    problems and give recommendations for service providers to ensure usable    and secure logins for everyone.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Proceedings Paper,English,"Markert, P (Corresponding Author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Bochum, Germany.

IEEE,"Enhancing Secured Access of Archives, Ranking and Safe Seek in Websearch",,2016,,,,,"In recent days, web searching and security of the archives plays most    incredible progress. The enduring research prototypes many web search    show the result by searching the relevant data alone. Due to the mere    relevancy search, the users may loss some useful data which are not    included in the search result. Moreover, it also may consume more time    by searching the data sequentially. To overcome these challenges    stemming process is united with the existing model for searching the    both labelled and unlabelled documents. Furthermore, User Based    Advertisement (UBA) is included with the proposed search engine to    display the advertisements based on search. To improve the ranking    system, Time Stamp Based Analysis (TSBA) is incorporated in the process    for easy search of users. With these improvementsduring the    searchprocess inkeyword search and posting the comments in the link any    offensive words are used it will give the alert to remove the word.    whiledownloading one's file that are uploaded in the web search become    quite easy.

Thus, skin cancer prevention is essential for    children. The objective of this study was to test an intervention to    facilitate implementation of district sun safety policies. Elementary    schools (N = 118) from 40 California public school districts with a    school board-approved policy for sun safety were recruited along with    one principal and teacher from each school. Elementary schools were    randomly assigned to receive the 20-month Sun Safe Schools intervention    (N = 58) or to a minimal informational control condition (N = 60).    Principals were 47.8 and teachers 44.3 years of age and were    predominately female (principals 72.7\%; teachers 86.7\%) and White    (principals 72.0\%; teachers 68.2\%). The 20-month Sun Safe Schools    intervention was delivered to principals and included a coaching    session, telephone and email contacts, provision of resources for    practice implementation, and a small grant program. The principal (N =    118) and a teacher (N = 113) at each school reported on school sun    protection practices 20-months post-baseline. The schools were diverse    in student characteristics (M = 64.1\% free/reduced price meals; M =    54.5\% Hispanic). Intervention principals reported implementing more sun    safety practices overall (control M = 2.7, intervention M = 4.2, p <    .005) and more practices not present in the district's policy (control M    = 0.4, intervention M = 0.9, p = .005). Principals and teachers combined    replicated these findings and also reported implementing more practices    present in the district policy (control M = 0.9, intervention M = 1.3, p    = .005).

IEEE,A Literature Review of Notification Systems: Challenges and    Opportunities for Fake News Alerts,,2024,,,279-284,,"Accurate information is vital for countering misinformation, enabling    informed decisions, and shaping societal outcomes. Many studies explore    various methods of fake news detection. Yet, no effort has been made to    systematically review existing notification systems that alert users to    fake news in the advocacy of accurate information. This advocacy    empowers individuals to discern truth, fosters accountability, and    safeguards democratic values. This paper presents our synthesis review    study, conducted through the Systematic Literature Review (SLR)    methodology, to assess the existing notification systems employed in    various use cases, addressing this gap, and identifying research    opportunities in alerting users to fake news. This study focuses on four    primary technologies: cell broadcast, short message system, mobile    notification, and email notification. Our study found that content    challenges, frequency, communication, security, and reliability provided    opportunities for content sufficiency, personalization with privacy    considerations, and enhanced safety.

Recent advancements in post-quantum    cryptography have further strengthened IBS schemes, making them    resilient against quantum computing threats and ensuring their    applicability in future secure communications. At ProvSec'21, Shaw and    Dutta introduced an identity-based signature obtained from the    isogeny-based signature scheme CSI-FiSh by Beullens et al. at    ASIACRYPT'19. Later, at PQCrypto'23, Chen et al. proposed a tightly    secure IBS by utilising the tightly secure variant of CSI -FiSh, called    Lossy CSI -FiSh, by Kaafarani et al. at PKC'20.    In this paper, we generalise those results to obtain a framework for    constructing an IBS scheme from cryptographic (non-abelian) group    actions. Under the pseudorandom assumption of underlying group actions,    we prove that our IBS is tightly secure in the random oracle model.    Moreover, we also generalise a Forward-Secure Identity-based Signature    (FSIBS) scheme from group actions. This scheme ensures past signatures    remain unforgeable even if the current signing key is compromised. Our    schemes can be instantiated from existing NIST's post-quantum signature    candidates such as MEDS, LESS and ALTEQ.",SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,"152 BEACH ROAD, \#21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",Proceedings Paper,English,"Khuc, XT (Corresponding Author), Univ Wollongong, Sch Comp \& Informat Technol, Inst Cybersecur \& Cryptol, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.

Internet Soc,Didn't You Hear Me? - Towards More Successful Web Vulnerability    Notifications,,2018,,BS4QO,,,"After treating the notification of vulnerable parties as mere side-notes    in research, the security community has recently put more focus on how    to conduct vulnerability disclosure at scale. The first works in this    area have shown that while notifications are helpful to a significant    fraction of operators, the vast majority of systems remain unpatched. In    this paper, we build on these previous works, aiming to understand why    the effects are not more significant. To that end, we report on a    notification experiment targeting more than 24,000 domains, which    allowed us to analyze what technical and human aspects are roadblocks to    a successful campaign. As part of this experiment, we explored potential    alternative notification channels beyond email, including social media    and phone. In addition, we conducted an anonymous survey with the    notified operators, investigating their perspectives on our    notifications. We show the pitfalls of email-based communications, such    as the impact of anti-spam filters, the lack of trust by recipients, and    the hesitation in fixing vulnerabilities despite awareness. However, our    exploration of alternative communication channels did not suggest a more    promising medium. Seeing these results, we pinpoint future directions in    improving security notifications.",INTERNET SOC,"1775 WIEHLE AVE, STE 201, RESTON, VA, UNITED STATES",Proceedings Paper,English,"Stock, B (Corresponding Author), Saarland Univ, CISPA, Saarbrucken, Germany.

These mechanisms are generally weak, exploitable, and force users to    choose new passwords. Emailing the original password exposes the    password to third parties. To address these issues, and to allow    forgotten passwords to be securely restored, we present a scheme called    Mercury. Its primary mode employs user-level public keys and a personal    mobile device (PMD) such as a smart-phone, netbook, or tablet. A user    generates a key pair on her PMD; the private key remains on the PMD and    the public key is shared with different sites (e.g., during account    setup). For password recovery, the site sends the (public key)-encrypted    password to the user's pre-registered email address, or displays the    encrypted password on a webpage, e.g., as a barcode. The encrypted    password is then decrypted using the PMD and revealed to the user.

IEEE,A Novel HIDS and Log Collection Based System for Digital Forensics in    Cloud Environment,,2017,,,1434-1438,,"Nowadays, cloud computing has become an emerging and widely used    technology throughout the world on account of its dynamic, reliable and    customizable quality of service. However, at the same time, the security    problem of cloud environment is attracted more and more attentions from    academia and industry. In many concerns regarding cloud computing    security, the digital forensic is a hot topic. Compared with traditional    digital forensic on common digital devices and hardware, it is difficult    to implement digital forensic in cloud because it is very hard to    collect logs from cloud environment. In this paper, we try to design a    new system to address the issue of digital forensic in cloud    environment. We use a new architecture to help investigators performing    the log collection. Firstly, a Host-based Intrusion Detection System    (HIDS) is introduced to secure the data in cloud from malicious attacks    of intruders. Then, based on the feedback results of HIDS, one web    server generates email alerts and Secure Shell (SSH) message to restrict    further suspicious activities. Finally, the digital forensic    investigators can collect reliable evidence of suspected user. In this    way, HIDS and log collection will be significant part for digital    forensic in cloud environment.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Shaikh, AA (Corresponding Author), Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Comp Sci \& Technol, Dalian, Peoples R China.

This study presents an investigation of    the relationships between three personality traits Machiavellianism,    narcissism, and psychopathy (i.e., the Dark Triad) and phishing effort,    attack success, and end-user susceptibility to phishing emails.    Participants were recruited in two stages. The first set of participants    acted as attackers, creating phishing emails. The second set of    participants acted as end-users, reading both benevolent and phishing    emails and indicating their likely behavioral response to each email.    Our findings suggest that attackers' Dark Triad scores relate to the    effort that they put in writing a phishing email, but do not predict    phishing success. Instead, it is the end-users' Dark Triad scores that    predict the success of phishing emails. We found that higher levels of    attacker Machiavellianism were linked to increased phishing effort,    while end-user narcissism was associated to greater vulnerability when    receiving phishing emails.

We provide novel insights into this topic    through an online study (n=413) in which we presented participants with    up to three data breaches that had exposed their email addresses and    other personal information. Overall, 73\% of participants were affected    by at least one breach, 5.36 breaches on average. Many participants    attributed the cause of being affected by a breach to their poor email    and security practices; only 14\% correctly attributed the cause to    external factors such as breached organizations and hackers.    Participants were unaware of 74\% of displayed breaches and expressed    various emotions when learning about them. While some reported intending    to take action, most participants believed the breach would not impact    them.

IEEE,Attacks In Online And Otip,,2017,,,69-72,,"With the developing digital era, the users are more vulnerable to    various types of security threats such as Phishing(RAT), a serious    security threat to the internet users in which the intruder sends an    email which looks legitimate, where the RATs are usually downloaded    invisibly with a user requested program such as game or in this case an    email attachment. RATs provide a backdoor for administrative control    over the targeted computer, from which the intruder will be allowed to    access all sensitive and confidential data such as banking application,    which needs more security. It is important to prevent such phishing    attacks. One of the ways to prevent the password theft is to    authenticate a user without the use of the text password. In this paper    we propose an idea which eliminates the use of the permanent text    passwords, by authenticating the user through image based password.    After image based authentication, the user will obtain the One Time    Password (OTP) using the messaging service available in the internet.    The image based authentication method relies on the user's ability to    recognize the pre-chosen images from a grid of pictures which appears in    a random manner. This paper integrates One time Image password based    authentication and HMAC based one time password and to achieve high    level of security in authenticating the user and these algorithms are    very economical to implement",IEEE COMPUTER SOC,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Vivekanandhan (Corresponding Author), KCG Coll Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Madras, Tamil Nadu, India.

IEEE,Unified View of IoT and CPS Security and Privacy,,2024,,,495-499,,"The concepts of Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber Physical Systems    (CPS) are closely related to each other. IoT is often used to refer to    small interconnected devices like those in smart home while CPS often    refers to large interconnected devices like industry machines and smart    cars. In this paper, we present a unified view of IoT and CPS: from the    perspective of network architecture, IoT and CPS are similar given that    they are based on either the OSI model or TCP/IP model. In both IoT and    CPS, networking/communication modules are attached to original things so    that isolated things can be integrated into cyber space. If needed,    actuators can also be integrated with a thing so as to control the    thing. With this unified view, we can perform risk assessment of an    IoT/CPS system from six factors, hardware, networking, operating system    (OS), software, data and human. To illustrate the use of such risk    analysis framework, we analyze an air quality monitoring network, smart    home using smart plugs and building automation system (BAS).

Traditionally, many phishing emails    have been characterized by typos, errors, and poor language. These    errors can be mitigated by LLMs, potentially lowering the barrier for    attackers. Despite this, there is a lack of large-scale studies    comparing the effectiveness of LLM-generated lateral phishing emails to    those crafted by humans. Current literature does not adequately address    the comparative effectiveness of LLM and human-generated lateral    phishing emails in a real-world, large-scale organizational setting,    especially considering the potential for LLMs to generate more    convincing and error-free phishing content. To address this gap, we    conducted a pioneering study within a large university, targeting its    workforce of approximately 9,000 individuals including faculty, staff,    administrators, and student workers. Our results indicate that    LLM-generated lateral phishing emails are as effective as those written    by communications professionals, emphasizing the critical threat posed    by LLMs in leading phishing campaigns. We break down the results of the    overall phishing experiment, comparing vulnerability between departments    and job roles. Furthermore, to gather qualitative data, we administered    a detailed questionnaire, revealing insights into the reasons and    motivations behind vulnerable employee's actions. This study contributes    to the understanding of cyber security threats in educational    institutions and provides a comprehensive comparison of LLM and    human-generated phishing emails' effectiveness, considering the    potential for LLMs to generate more convincing content.

It is an unlawful    activity which uses a group of social engineering and technology to    collect an Internet user's sensitive information. The identification of    phishing techniques can be performed in various methods of    communications like email, instant messages, pop-up messages, or at web    page level. Over the period, a number of research articles have    published with different techniques and procedures but have failed to    detect all associated risks and provide a comprehensive solution. This    paper presents a theoretical model of CRI to study this threat in a    systematic manner. While there is a common perception about the    successful phishing attack involves creating an identical messages or    website to deceive the internet user however this theory has not been    utilized to evaluate this threat and investigate the gaps    systematically. Our model attempts to evaluate this crime, review    different research perspectives and approaches and investigate the gaps.

At the    mean time, the attacks launched toward the websites or web attack also    have been found more often. In particular, SQL Injection Attack is    considered the most harmful web attack and has been found and ranked on    top of the frequently detected web-attack. Typically, the website    developed by the web programmer with well-comprehension of SQL Injection    will be prevented from this attacking. At the same time, over a half of    the web programmers unfortunately has not studied well about this kind    of web attack; therefore, a number of websites are still encountering    the risk. Regarding the security, there were the uses of the IPS    installation and firewall application with protecting functions against    SQL Injection Attack as well as the Top 100 web-attack protections;    however, the main problem is a very expensive cost of the    protection-tool installation, in which medium and small organizations    are unable to afford the installation cost.    This research aimed to offer the solution for the protection system    against SQL Injection Attack in which the web programmer needed not to    waste the time in writing codes on the website. Besides, the system,    designed by the researchers, cost a lower expense. The researchers    proposed the protection system by using a computer and Linux as a    blocker between the website and the user (placed on the server zone),    and creating GUI Application that could define the rules in IPTABLES (a    free firewall as the software equipped with Linux) in order to possibly    protect against SQL Injection Attack. Moreover, the researchers' team    assessed the performance of the protection system's security and    functional speed, and found that the proposed protection could    authentically protect the websites from SQL Injection Attack whereas the    drop of the website's functional speed did not exceed 1\%.",INT ASSOC COMPUTER SCIENCE \& INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PRESS-IACSIT PRESS,"SINGAPORE OFFICE, NO. 07-42, BLK 708, JURONG WEST STREET 81, SINGAPORE,    00000, SINGAPORE",Proceedings Paper,English,"Sriphum, W (Corresponding Author), Mahasarakham Univ, Fac Informat, Talat, Thailand.

"Dukarm, Christopher and Dill, Richard and Reith, Mark",Improving Phishing Awareness in the United States Department of Defense,,2019,,,172-177,,"Phishing emails are rapidly increasing in sophistication, evolving from    poorly crafted attempts to entice a recipient to click, into legitimate    looking emails and attachments. In response, email providers have to    improve their detection technology by adding new rules to their    firewalls and filters to block incoming spam and phishing emails. To    overcome technical measures, attackers modify the content of their    phishing emails and the source email address. In this cat and mouse    game, network defenders rely on the user to report new threats, and the    users depend on phishing awareness training to help them identify    malicious emails. Fora large organization like the United States DoD    (DoD) which boasts a workforce of 3.2 million employees, it is difficult    to properly train employees to identify and report malicious emails.    Like other organizations the DoD requires its employees to complete    phishing awareness training, however the effectiveness of this training    is widely disputed. Phishing prevention can be broken into three main    components: automated filters and firewalls, automated warning messages,    and behavioral training. This paper analyzes existing United States DoD    phishing awareness behavioral training and proposes 3 principles of an    improved behavioral training model. This paper will detail how focused    training objectives, a DoD content-sharing platform and a realistic    delivery method can be combined to offer an effective and sustainable    phishing awareness campaign.",ACAD  CONFERENCES LTD,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",Proceedings Paper,English,"Dukarm, C (Corresponding Author), US Air Force Inst Technol, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433 USA.

IEEE,The Impacts of Behavioral Probability Weighting on Security Investments    in Interdependent Systems,,2019,,,5260-5265,,"We consider a system consisting of multiple interdependent assets, and a    set of defenders, each responsible for securing a subset of the assets    against an attacker. The interdependencies between assets are captured    by an attack graph, where an edge from one asset to another indicates    that if the former asset is compromised, an attack can be launched on    the latter asset. Each edge has an associated probability of successful    attack, which can be reduced via security investments by the defender    responsible for that edge. While prior work has studied the security    investments in such scenarios, in this work we consider what happens    when the defenders exhibit characteristics of boundedly-rational human    decision-making that have been identified by behavioral economics. In    particular, humans have been shown to perceive probabilities in a    nonlinear manner, typically overweighting low probabilities and    underweighting high probabilities. We show that such nonlinear    probability weighting can affect the security investments in    interdependent systems, and suboptimal investments can arise under such    weighting in certain network topologies. We also show that the presence    of a defender who exhibits behavioral probability weighting can be    beneficial for the other defenders in the network, in terms of making    their assets more secure.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Abdallah, M (Corresponding Author), Purdue Univ, Sch Elect \& Comp Engn, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.

Around 500 billion mails are sent each day and    the count is expected to be increasing. Today, even the sensitive and    private information are shared through emails, thus making it the    primary target for attackers and hackers. Also, the companies having    their own mail server, relies on cloud system for storing the mails at a    lower cost and maintenance. This affected the privacy of users as the    searching pattern is visible to the cloud. To rectify this, we need to    have a secure architecture for storing the emails and retrieve them    according to the user queries. Data as well as the queries and    computations to retrieve the relevant mails should be hidden from the    third party. This article proposes a modified homomorphic encryption    (MHE) technique to secure the mails. Homomorphic encryption is made    practical using MHE and by incorporating Map Reduce parallel programming    model, the execution time is exponentially reduced. Well known    techniques in information retrieval, like Vector Space model and Term    Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) concepts are utilized    for finding relevant mails to the query.

Other remote    services can use SIM as an authentication tool over existing GSM    technology through GPRS, which is an additional packet data feature for    the GSM network. GPRS enables packet-switched traffic to exist in    predominantly circuit-switched GSM infrastructure. As GPRS is designed    to support packet based protocols, such as the Internet Protocol (IP)    based burst and uneven traffic flow, it enables new services such as    reasonably fast access to the Internet, electronic mail and other data    oriented services. These services have been too inefficient in    traditional circuit-switched digital mobile networks. Using GPRS    features the e-commerce applications can use SIM for user authentication    in transactions. SIM can also be a tool for user identity and    authentication around the corporate intranets. This can reduce security    infrastructure setup and investment overhead for the security concerned    organizations.

Internet Soc,TLS in the Wild: An Internet-wide Analysis of TLS-based Protocols for    Electronic Communication,,2016,,,,,"Email and chat still constitute the majority of electronic communication    on the Internet. The standardisation and acceptance of protocols such as    SMTP, IMAP, POP3, XMPP, and IRC has allowed to deploy servers for email    and chat in a decentralised and interoperable fashion. These protocols    can be secured by providing encryption with TLS-directly or via the    STARTTLS extension. X.509 PKIs and ad hoc methods can be leveraged to    authenticate communication peers. However, secure configuration is not    straight-forward and many combinations of encryption and authentication    mechanisms lead to insecure deployments and potentially compromise of    data in transit. In this paper, we present the largest study to date    that investigates the security of our email and chat infrastructures. We    used active Internet-wide scans to determine the amount of secure    service deployments, and employed passive monitoring to investigate to    which degree user agents actually choose secure mechanisms for their    communication. We addressed both client-to-server interactions as well    as server-to-server forwarding. Apart from the authentication and    encryption mechanisms that the investigated protocols offer on the    transport layer, we also investigated the methods for client    authentication in use on the application layer. Our findings shed light    on an insofar unexplored area of the Internet. Our results, in a    nutshell, are a mix of both positive and negative findings. While large    providers offer good security for their users, most of our communication    is poorly secured in transit, with weaknesses in the cryptographic setup    and especially in the choice of authentication mechanisms.

ACM,On-Demand Biometrics: Fast Cross-Device Authentication,,2016,,,3761-3766,,"We explore the use of a new way to log into a web service, such as email    or social media. Using on-demand biometrics, users sign in from a    browser on a computer using just their name, which sends a request to    their phone for approval. Users approve this request by authenticating    on their phone using their fingerprint, which completes the login in the    browser. On-demand biometrics thus replace passwords or temporary access    codes found in two-step verification with the ease of use of biometrics.    We present the results of an interview study on the use of on-demand    biometrics with a live login backend. Participants perceived our system    as convenient and fast to use and also expressed their trust in    fingerprint authentication to keep their accounts safe. We motivate the    design of on-demand biometrics, present an analysis of participants' use    and responses around general account security and authentication, and    conclude with implications for designing fast and easy cross-device    authentication.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Holz, C (Corresponding Author), Microsoft Res, Redmond, WA 98052 USA.

IEEE,Efficient Dictionary for Salted Password Analysis,,2014,,,,,"User authentication is essential for accessing computing resources,    network resources, email accounts, online portals etc. To authenticate a    user, system stores user credentials (user id and password pair) in    system. It has been an interested field problem to discover user    password from a system and similarly protecting them against any such    possible attack. In this work we show that passwords are still    vulnerable to hash chain based and efficient dictionary attacks. Human    generated passwords use some identifiable patterns. We have analysed a    sample of 19 million passwords, of different lengths, available online    and studied the distribution of the symbols in the password strings. We    show that the distribution of symbols in user passwords is affected by    the native language of the user. From symbol distributions we can build    smart and efficient dictionaries, which are smaller in size and their    coverage of plausible passwords from Key-space is large. These smart    dictionaries make dictionary based attacks practical.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Vishwakarma, D (Corresponding Author), Indian Inst Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India.

This has propelled patient safety to the forefront, with    reporting systems allowing for the review of local events to determine    their root causes. As residents engage in a substantial amount of    patient care in academic emergency departments, it is critical to use    these safety event reports for resident-focused interventions and    educational initiatives. This study analyzes reports from the Virginia    Commonwealth University Health System to understand how the reports are    categorized and how it relates to opportunities for resident education.    Methods: Identifying categories from the literature, three subject    matter experts (attending physician, nursing director, registered nurse)    categorized an initial 20 reports to resolve category gaps and then 100    reports to determine inter-rater reliability. Given sufficient    agreement, the remaining 400 reports were coded individually for type of    event and education among other categories.    Results: After reviewing 513 events, we found that the most common event    types were issues related to staff and resident training (25\%) and    communication (18\%), with 31\% requiring no education, 46\% requiring    directed educational feedback to an individual or group, 20\% requiring    education through monthly safety updates or meetings, 3\% requiring    urgent communication by email or in-person, and <1\% requiring    simulation.    Conclusion: Twenty years after the publication of To Err is Human, gains    have been made integrating quality assurance and patient safety within    medical education and hospital systems, but there remains extensive work    to be done. Through a review and analysis of our patient safety event    reporting system, we were able to gain a better understanding of the    events that are submitted, including the types of events and their    severity, and how these relate to the types of educational interventions    provided (eg, feedback, simulation). We also determined that these    events can help inform resident education and learning using various    types of education. Additionally, incorporating residents in the review    process, such as through root cause analyses, can provide residents with    high-quality, engaging learning opportunities and useful, lifelong    skills, which is invaluable to our learners and future physicians.",WESTJEM,"C/O SHAHRAM LOTFIPOUR, MD, MPH, 333 CITY BLVD W STE 640, RT 128-01,    ORANGE, CA 92868 USA",Article,English,"Hemphill, RR (Corresponding Author), Virginia Commonwealth Univ Hlth Syst, 1250 E Marshall St,Box 980510,Hosp Adm Suite, Richmond, VA 23298 USA.

To gain victim's    trust and confidence phishers have started using visceral factors and    familiarity cues. Phishing is not always money centric; phisher defame    the user's goodwill and character. Defamation in enterprise could be    much more traumatic than being embarrassed at a social networking site.    It is a challenging task to address this issue. It is evident through    literature review that single phishing detection filter approaches are    insufficient to detect phishing in enterprise environ. Therefore, a    novel anti-phishing model for enterprise using artificial neural network    is proposed. In addition, this model effectively identifies whether the    phishing email is known phishing or unknown phishing to reduce the trust    and familiarity-based email phishing enterprise environ. The    feed-forward backpropagation and Levenberg-Marquart methods of ANN are    adopted to enhance the URL classification process and with Fuzzy    Inference System to get result with imprecise data of social features.

The Translational Medicine and Patient    Safety in Europe (TRANSFoRm) clinical trial tools enable automated    identification, recruitment and follow-up in clinical trials,    potentially saving time, effort and costs for all parties involved.    This study evaluates the acceptability and feasibility of TRANSFoRm to    improve clinical trial recruitment in primary care.    A feasibility study was conducted in three general practices in Poland.    Participants were physicians and patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux    disease. Semi-structured interviews were held to obtain feedback about    the usefulness, ease of use and overall experience with the TRANSFoRm    tools and to identify potential usability issues. Data were analysed    thematically.    A total of 5 physicians and 10 patients participated in the study.    Physicians were satisfied with the usefulness of the system, as it    enabled easier and faster identification, recruitment and follow-up of    patients compared with existing methods. Patients found the TRANSFoRm    apps easy to use to report patient outcomes. However, they also felt    that the apps may not be useful for patients with limited exposure to    smartphone and web technologies. Two main usability issues were    identified: physicians could not access the result of the randomization    at the end of each visit, and participants could not locate the    follow-up reminder email.    This study provides new evidence on the acceptability and feasibility of    TRANSFoRm to enable automated identification, recruitment and follow-up    of study participants in primary care trials.

ACM,Porscha: Policy Oriented Secure Content Handling in Android,,2010,,,221-230,,"The penetration of cellular networks worldwide and emergence of smart    phones has led to a revolution in mobile content. Users consume diverse    content when, for example, exchanging photos, playing games, browsing    websites, and viewing multimedia. Current phone platforms provide    protections for user privacy, the cellular radio, and the integrity of    the OS itself. However, few offer protections to protect the content    once it enters the phone. For example, MP3-based MMS or photo content    placed on Android smart phones can be extracted and shared with    impunity. In this paper, we explore the requirements and enforcement of    digital rights management (DRM) policy on smart phones. An analysis of    the Android market shows that DRM services should ensure: a) protected    content is accessible only by authorized phones b) content is only    accessible by provider-endorsed applications, and c) access is regulated    by contextual constraints, e. g., used for a limited time, a maximum    number of view-ings, etc. The Porscha system developed in this work    places content proxies and reference monitors within the Android    middleware to enforce DRM policies embedded in received content. A pilot    study controlling content obtained over SMS, MMS, and email illustrates    the expressibility and enforcement of Porscha policies. Our experiments    demonstrate that Porscha is expressive enough to articulate needed DRM    policies and that their enforcement has limited impact on performance.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Ongtang, M (Corresponding Author), Dhurakijpundit Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Bangkok 10210, Thailand.

Other remote    services can use SIM as an authentication tool over existing GSM    technology through GPRS, which is an additional packet data feature for    the GSM network. It allows both packet-switched and circuit-switched    traffic to exist in the GSM infrastructure. As GPRS is designed to    support packet based protocols, such as the Internet Protocol (IP) based    bursty and uneven traffic flow, it enables new services such as    reasonably fast access to the Internet, electronic mail and other data    oriented services, that have been too inefficient in traditional    circuit-switched digital mobile networks. Using GPRS features, the    e-commerce applications can use SIM as user anthentication for    transactions. SIM can also be a tool for user identity and    authentication around the corporate intranets. This can reduce security    infrastructure setup and investment overhead for the security concerned    organizations.

Methods A pragmatic cluster randomised trial is planned to be carried    out in 20 emergency departments (EDs) across five healthcare systems    over 18 months. The intervention consists of a user-centred CDS    integrated into ED clinician electronic workflow and available for    guidance to: (1) determine whether patients presenting to the ED meet    criteria for OUD, (2) assess withdrawal symptoms and (3) ascertain and    motivate patient willingness to initiate treatment. The CDS guides the    ED clinician to initiate BUP and facilitate follow-up. The primary    outcome is the rate of BUP initiated in the ED. Secondary outcomes are:    (1) rates of receiving a referral, (2) fidelity with the CDS and (3)    rates of clinicians providing any ED-initiated BUP, referral for ongoing    treatment and receiving Drug Addiction Act of 2000 training. Primary and    secondary outcomes will be analysed using generalised linear mixed    models, with fixed effects for intervention status (CDS vs usual care),    prespecified site and patient characteristics, and random effects for    study site.

Traditional defenses, such as    firewalls and antivirus software, often fail to counter these    sophisticated attacks, which target human vulnerabilities. To strengthen    defenses, healthcare organizations are increasingly adopting Machine    Learning (ML) techniques. ML-based SPA defenses use advanced algorithms    to analyze various features, including email content, sender behavior,    and attachments, to detect potential threats. This capability enables    proactive security measures that address risks in real-time. The    interpretability of ML models fosters trust and allows security teams to    continuously refine these algorithms as new attack methods emerge.    Implementing ML techniques requires integrating diverse data sources,    such as electronic health records, email logs, and incident reports,    which enhance the algorithms' learning environment. Feedback from    end-users further improves model performance. Among tested models, the    hierarchical models, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) achieved the    highest accuracy at 99.99\%, followed closely by the sequential    Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model at 99.94\%. In    contrast, the traditional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model showed an    accuracy of 98.46\%.

For many across Africa, compliance can be difficult. The aim    of this study was to 1) understand the impact of student's household's    ability to comply with COVID-19 mitigation strategies, 2) identify    predictors of mitigation strategy compliance, and 3) describe the impact    of COVID-19 on household economics, food-security, and mental    well-being. Materials and methods We conducted an email-based survey    among current medical and pharmacy students of the University of Liberia    College of Health Sciences between July and October 2020. The    questionnaire was designed to explore their household's ability to    comply with current mitigation strategies, as well as the pandemic ` s    impact on the student's household's finances and food security.    Descriptive statistics were used to delineate demographic    characteristics. Logistic regression was used to model factors    associated with ability to comply with COVID-19 mitigation strategies,    as well as participant's food security. Results 113 persons responded to    the questionnaire. Seventy-six (67 center dot 3\%) reported income    losses as a result of the pandemic, with 93 (82 center dot 3\%)    reporting being ``somewhat{''} or ``very worried{''} about their    households' finances. Seventy-seven (68 center dot 1\%) participants    reported food stocks that were sufficient for one-week or less. Forty    (35\%) participants reported eating less preferred foods or skipping    meals in the past week. Overall, 20 participants (19 center dot 4\%) had    a positive depression screen. Conclusions Study participants showed    mixed results in being able to adhere to national COVID-19 mitigation    strategies, with household level stressors experienced around finances    and food security. Until Liberia has access to vaccinations for most of    its citizens, COVID-19 response measures need to provide social    protections that address basic needs (shelter, clothing and food), and    which specifically targets food insecurity. Preventative interventions    for mental health problems must be incorporated into Liberia's response    to the pandemic.",PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",Article,English,"Moon, TD (Corresponding Author), Vanderbilt Univ, Dept Pediat, Div Infect Dis, Med Ctr, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.

Currently,    there is a gap in accessible models that offer rational alerts for    diverse driving scenarios. This article introduces a generalized, yet    concise framework called the potential damage risk (PODAR) model for    estimating collision risk and issuing warnings of hazard cases. The    PODAR model is devised by connecting collision risk with potential    collision damage across both spatial and temporal dimensions in a    meaningful physical way, which includes four key components: trajectory    prediction, damage estimation, spatiotemporal attenuation, and attention    simulation. An empirical model featuring six adjustable parameters is    presented and calibrated using a publicly available dataset for    validation. With predefined fixed risk thresholds, the PODAR model    demonstrates the ability to issue valid warnings for potential    collisions in both longitudinal and lateral directions, negating the    need for manual driving situation classification. The study investigates    the performance of the PODAR model in a range of dynamic driving    situations through numerical simulations, such as side-pass,    car-following, and an unsignaled left turn. Additionally, three    demonstrative cases derived from the InD dataset, which features    realistic driving scenarios, are also presented. The results reveal that    the PODAR model is effective in estimating risk and detecting    collisions, providing reliable signals for potential collisions. In    addition, the PODAR model, as a generalized framework, has the ability    to incorporate existing metrics and exhibits impressive scalability to    integrate new advancements in trajectory prediction and human-like risk    perception, thanks to its modular structure.",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Article; Early Access,English,"Li, SE (Corresponding Author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Vehicle \& Mobil, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.

As the user extends the stick to make contact with a virtual object, the    contact point with the virtual object and the targeted contact point    with the physical object are continually updated, and the virtual stick    is redirected to synchronize the virtual and real contacts. Redirection    is applied either just to the virtual stick, or to both the virtual    stick and hand. A user study (N = 26) confirms the effectiveness of the    proposed redirection method. A first experiment following a two-interval    forced-choice design reveals that the offset detection thresholds are    {[}-15cm, +15cm]. A second experiment asks participants to guess the    shape of an invisible virtual object by tapping it and by tracing its    contour with the handheld stick, using a real world disk as a source of    passive haptic feedback.

J Strength Cond Res 27(9): 2626-2633,    2013The rapid growth and expanding use of high school strength and    conditioning facilities (SCFs) creates a need to research and better    understand these vital facilities. This study was designed to examine    SCFs at the high school level including facility size, equipment,    leadership/staffing, and safety. A 70-item online survey instrument,    developed with expert input from certified strength professionals, was    used to collect data regarding the SCFs in high schools throughout a    midwestern state, and was distributed via email to a total of 390 high    school athletic directors. Survey respondents (n = 108) all reported the    presence of SCFs with 95.4\% indicating a dedicated SCF space. A strong    positive correlation (r = 0.610, p 0.001) was determined between the    variables of SCF size in square feet and school size measured by total    enrollment. Analysis of variance and (2) analyses revealed significant    differences in equipment, facility size, and safety factors based on the    categorical variables of school size and the presence of certified    strength and conditioning specialist (CSCS) leadership. It appears the    CSCS's application of their scientific knowledge goes beyond training    athletes for the goal of improving athletic performance to actually    influence the SCF itself.

PROMETHEUS in    IBD-BOOST: study within a trial, a decentralised UK randomised    controlled trial",TRIALS,2025,26,211,,JUN 18,"BackgroundParticipant Information Leaflets (PILs) are lengthy and    increasingly complex, and could deter research participation. A    shortened PIL may be more appealing as it is likely to provide a more a    manageable volume of information. Previous research has found that    shortened PILs are no less effective for recruitment outcomes, and we    deemed it useful to replicate this in an online setting. We also decided    to compare retention rates, given the potential for more information to    increase participants' motivation.AimTo evaluate the efficacy of a    shortened vs standard-length PIL on trial recruitment and retention    rates.MethodsThis two-arm study within a trial (SWAT) was embedded in a    host randomised controlled trial (RCT)-IBD-BOOST.Potential participants    were randomised to receive a standard-length or shortened PIL    electronically for recruitment to the host RCT. An ethics committee    approved potential participants being blinded to this    randomisation.Primary outcome: The percentage of SWAT participants    receiving the shortened vs standard PIL who were recruited to the    RCT.MethodsThis two-arm study within a trial (SWAT) was embedded in a    host randomised controlled trial (RCT)-IBD-BOOST.Potential participants    were randomised to receive a standard-length or shortened PIL    electronically for recruitment to the host RCT.

An ethics committee    approved potential participants being blinded to this    randomisation.Primary outcome: The percentage of SWAT participants    receiving the shortened vs standard PIL who were recruited to the    RCT.ResultsFour thousand two hundred one participants were randomised to    the standard-length (n = 2099) and shortened (n = 2102) PIL arms.    Thirty-four email queries were received about the PILs-18 from those who    received the standard and 16 from those receiving the shortened. Seven    hundred eight SWAT participants were recruited to the RCT-333 (15.86\%)    who received the standard-length PIL and 375 (17.84\%) who received the    shortened (OR = 1.15, (95\%CI = 0.98, 1.35), p = 0.09). Retention rates    in the RCT were not statistically different between groups.ConclusionWe    did not find evidence of a significant difference between RCT    recruitment and retention rates in participants randomised to the    standard-length PIL compared with the shortened. It may be that a    shortened PIL has the same effect on recruitment and retention outcomes,    providing that the trial does not require extensive information for    other reasons (e.g. safety). Therefore, it could be argued that    researchers have a choice about how long to make PILs, perhaps with a    link to more detail. Alternatively, given that there was no benefit of    the shortened PIL, it may be worth comparing written PILs with other    methods of conveying information to determine optimal means of    encouraging participation and retention in decentralised trials.Host    trial registrationA randomised controlled trial of supported, online,    self-management for symptoms of fatigue, pain and urgency/incontinence    in people with inflammatory bowel disease: the IBD-BOOST trial    (ISRCTN71618461 on ISRCTN registry).",BMC,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Miller, L (Corresponding Author), Queen Mary Univ London, Wolfson Inst Populat Hlth, Ctr Psychiat \& Mental Hlth CPMH, Unit Social \& Community Psychiat, Yvonne Carter Bldg,58 Turner St, London E1 2AB, England.

ACM,zkLogin: Privacy-Preserving Blockchain Authentication with Existing    Credentials,,2024,,,3182-3196,,"For many users, a private key based wallet serves as the primary entry    point to blockchains. Commonly recommended wallet authentication    methods, such as mnemonics or hardware wallets, can be cumbersome. This    difficulty in user onboarding has significantly hindered the adoption of    blockchain-based applications.    We develop zkLogin, a novel technique that leverages identity tokens    issued by popular platforms (any OpenID Connect enabled platform e.g.,    Google, Facebook, etc.) to authenticate transactions. At the heart of    zkLogin lies a signature scheme allowing the signer to sign using their    existing OpenID accounts and nothing else. This improves the user    experience significantly as users do not need to remember a new secret    and can reuse their existing accounts.    zkLogin provides strong security and privacy guarantees. Unlike prior    works, zkLogin's security relies solely on the underlying platform's    authentication mechanism without the need for any additional trusted    parties (e.g., trusted hardware or oracles). As the name suggests,    zkLogin leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to ensure that the    sensitive link between a user's off-chain and on-chain identities is    hidden, even from the platform itself.    zkLogin enables a number of important applications outside blockchains.    It allows billions of users to produce verifiable digital content    leveraging their existing digital identities, e.g., email address. For    example, a journalist can use zkLogin to sign a news article with their    email address, allowing verification of the article's authorship by any    party.    We have implemented and deployed zkLogin on the Sui blockchain as an    additional alternative to traditional digital signature-based addresses.    Due to the ease of web3 on-boarding just with social login, many    hundreds of thousands of zkLogin accounts have already been generated in    various industries such as gaming, DeFi, direct payments, NFT    collections, sports racing, cultural heritage, and many more.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Proceedings Paper,English,"Baldimtsi, F (Corresponding Author), Mysten Labs, Palo Alto, CA 94301 USA.

The source transmits a    linear combination of the users' common stream and private streams. Once    the common stream is retrieved, two decoding strategies can be adopted    by each user. In the first strategy, the nodes (near or far) treat the    far user's private stream as noise to retrieve the private stream of the    near user, then the far user decodes its own stream. In the second    strategy, the nodes decode the far user's private stream by treating the    one of the near user as noise, then the near user retrieves its private    stream while the far user decodes the stream of the near user in its    attempt to overhear it. Considering the four decoding combinations, we    obtain exact closed-form expressions for the outage probability, and    provide tight approximations for the secrecy outage probability.    Comparative results are also provided. In particular, it is shown that    to achieve better outage probability, with no concern about secrecy,    once the decoding of the common stream is completed, each user should    first retrieve the private stream with lower target data rate by    treating the other private stream as noise. To improve the secrecy    outage probability, once the common stream is decoded, the near user    must first decode the far user's private stream, and the far user should    first retrieve the private stream with lower target data rate.",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Article,English,"Musavian, L (Corresponding Author), Univ Essex, Sch Comp Sci \& Elect Engn, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.

Based on 24 semi-structured    interviews with mid-career office workers (70.8\% women, averaging 44    years old) at two U.S. universities, we found that less than 21\% of our    participants had any formal anti-phishing training. Much of what our    participants know about phishing comes from informal sources that    emphasize ``tips{''} and ``tricks{''} like those found in conversations    with friends, news stories, newsletters, social media, and podcasts.    These informal channels provide opportunities for IT professionals    wishing to enhance employees' anti-phishing awareness by better aligning    the delivery of expert advice with employees' current practices and    desires. We provide four recommendations designed to embrace ``guerrilla    learning{''} by distributing anti-phishing educational resources across    the workplace and workday in part to encourage the delivery of more    accurate information in more informal and incidental ways, and greater    dialogue between anti-phishing training instructors and learners.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Proceedings Paper,English,"Tally, AC (Corresponding Author), Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.

IEEE,Evaluating the Efficacy of Large Language Models in Identifying Phishing    Attempts,,2024,,,,,"Phishing, a prevalent cybercrime tactic for decades, remains a    significant threat in today's digital world. By leveraging clever social    engineering elements and modern technology, cybercrime targets many    individuals, businesses, and organizations to exploit trust and    security. These cyberattackers are often disguised in many trustworthy    forms to appear as legitimate sources. By cleverly using psychological    elements like urgency, fear, social proof, and other manipulative    strategies, phishers can lure individuals into revealing sensitive and    personalized information. Building on this pervasive issue within modern    technology, this paper will aim to analyze the effectiveness of 15 Large    Language Models (LLMs) in detecting phishing attempts, specifically    focusing on a randomized set of ``419 Scam{''} emails. The objective is    to determine which LLMs can accurately detect phishing emails by    analyzing a text file containing email metadata based on predefined    criteria. The experiment concluded that the following models, ChatGPT    3.5, GPT-3.5-Turbo-Instruct, and ChatGPT, were the most effective in    detecting phishing emails.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Patel, H (Corresponding Author), Western Univ, Dept Comp Sci, London, ON, Canada.

S.",LiveProbe: Exploring Continuous Voice Liveness Detection via    Phonemic Energy Response Patterns,IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL,2023,10,8,7215-7228,APR 15,"Voice assistants support contactless smart device control and thus act    as a holy grail of human-computer interaction. However, recent studies    reveal that an adversary can manipulate devices by vicious voice    commands. This security risk is caused by only executing one-time    liveness detection and lacking safeguard modules after service    activation. Therefore, identifying speaker type (i.e., human    articulators or loudspeakers) is critical in protecting voice-driven    services during an entire interaction session. In this article, we    propose a continuous voice liveness detection approach LiveProbe,    leveraging unique energy response patterns in frequency bands induced by    distinct voice generation mechanisms. The rationality behind LiveProbe    is presented in two aspects: human articulator reshapes initial voices    by exquisitely coordinated movements of vocal organs, which act as    band-pass filters generating unique energy responses; nevertheless, the    internal modules of loudspeakers are position fixed and cannot reproduce    this response characteristic. To that end, we first work on voice    generation mechanisms behind two-type speakers that cause spectrum    differences. Then, we elaborately construct signal processing and    deep-learning modules to extract liveness features. Especially, our    approach does not interfere with normal voice interaction and need not    to carry customized sensors. The experiment presents its effectiveness    against potential attacks with a false acceptance rate of 0.51\%.",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Article,English,"Jiang, HB (Corresponding Author), Hunan Univ, Coll Comp Sci \& Elect Engn, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China.

As we shift towards using the digital medium    to communicate medication information, it is important to address the    needs and preferences of different user groups so that they are more    likely to read and use this information. In this study, we examined what    digital medication information (DMI) format Canadian University students    want and why. (2) Methods: This study was a qualitative investigation of    young (aged 18-35) Canadian University students' (N = 36) preferences    and rationale supporting these preferences with respect to three    potential formats for providing DMI: email, a mobile application (app),    and online. Reported advantages and disadvantages of each of the three    DMI formats were identified and categorized into unique themes. (3)    Results: Findings from this study suggest that Canadian University    Students most want to receive DMI by email, followed by a mobile app,    and finally they were least receptive to online DMI. Participants    provided diverse themes of reasons supporting their preferences. (4)    Conclusions: Different user groups may have different needs with respect    to receiving DMI. The themes from this study suggest that using a    formative evaluation framework for assessing different DMI formats may    be useful in future research. Email may be the best way to share DMI    with younger, generally healthy, Canadian University students who are on    few medications. Further research is required to explore whether other    mediums for DMI are more appropriate for users with other    characteristics (e.g., older and less educated) and contexts (e.g.,    polypharmacy and complex conditions). Given the flexibility of digital    information, DMI could plausibly be provided in multiple formats and    could allow users to choose the option they like best and would be most    likely to use.",MDPI,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Article,English,"Monkman, H (Corresponding Author), Univ Victoria, Sch Hlth Informat Sci, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2, Canada.

Security in maintaining patient data is    important and there is a statuary obligation to do so, but few health    professionals have been trained on how to achieve this. There is no    information on the use of computers and email by doctors and nurses in    South Africa in the workplace and at home, and whether their current    computer practices meets legal and ethical requirements. The aims of    this study were to determine the use of computers by healthcare    practitioners in the workplace and home; the use and approach to data    storage, encryption and security of patient data and patient email; and    the use of informed consent to transmit data by email.    Methods: A self-administered questionnaire was administered to 400    health care providers from the state and private health care sectors.    The questionnaire covered computer use in the workplace and at home,    sharing of computers, data encryption and storage, email use, encryption    of emails and storage, and the use of informed consent for email    communication.    Results: 193 doctors and 207 nurses in the private and public sectors    completed the questionnaire. Forty (10\%) of participants do not use a    computer. A third of health professionals were the only users of    computers at work or at home. One hundred and ninety-eight respondents    (55\%) did not know if the data on the computers were encrypted, 132    (36.7\%) knew that the data were not encrypted and 30 (8.3\%)    individuals knew that the data on the computers they were using were    encrypted. Few doctors, 58 (16\%), received emails from patients, with    doctors more likely to receive emails from patients than nurses (p =    0.0025). Thirty-one percent of individuals did not respond to the    emails. Emails were saved by 40 (69\%) recipients but only 5 (12.5\%)    doctors encrypted the messages, 19 (47.5\%) individuals knowingly did    not encrypt and 16 (40.0\%) did not know if they encrypted the data.    While 20\% of health professionals have emailed patient data, but only    41.7\% gained consent to do so.    Conclusions: Most health professionals as sampled in South Africa are    not compliant with the National Health Act or the Electronic    Communications Transactions Act of South Africa or guidelines from    regulatory bodies when managing patient data on computers.

IEEE,Loxin - A Solution to Password-less Universal Login,,2014,,,488-493,,"As the easiest and cheapest way of authenticating an end user, password    based authentication methods have been consistently chosen by almost    every new cloud service. Unfortunately, the explosive growth of cloud    services and web applications has made it impossible for users to manage    dozens of passwords for accessing different cloud services. The    situation is even worse considering the potential application of    massively parallel computing devices such as GPU and ASIC for efficient    password cracking. Hence, from a usability viewpoint, passwords may have    reached the end of their useful life.    Motivated by a number of recent industry initiatives for online    authentication, we present Loxin, an innovative solution for    password-less universal login. Loxin aims to improve on passwords with    respect to both usability and security. Loxin takes advantages of push    message services for mobile devices and enables users to access multiple    cloud services by using pre-owned identities, such as email addresses,    together with few taps on their mobile devices.    In particular, the Loxin server cannot generate users' login    credentials, thereby eliminating the potential risk of server    compromises. Loxin is resistant to the most common attacks on cloud    services such as replay attacks and man-in-the-middle attacks. We also    discuss possible extensions for protecting Loxin from vendor lock-in and    single point of failure, in order to ensure Loxin to be an open and    stable authentication system. The application of the proposed Loxin    security framework to the recent MintChip Challenge demonstrates the    power of Loxin for building a real-world password-less mobile payment    solution.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Zhu, B (Corresponding Author), Univ Waterloo, Dept Elect \& Comp Engn, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.

IEEE,Benefits and Challenges of Utilizing Hardware Performance Counters for    COPPA Violation Detection,,2020,,,,,"This paper analyzes the findings of {[}1] regarding user privacy in    Android apps. Mobile applications have come under scrutiny for    allegations of data breaches and leaks, such as usernames, email IDs,    and locations. Subsequent documented instances of these violations have    led to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) imposing severe penalties on    the app developers. Recently, apps such as TikTok and BabyBus were    sanctioned and fined for flouting privacy regulations. To ensure the    safety of young users, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act    (COPPA) was enacted to monitor the data usage of apps dedicated to    children. Hence, it is imperative that children's apps adhere to COPPA.    Towards this end, {[}1] proposes COPPA Tracking by Checking    Hardware-level Activity (COPPTCHA), a Hardware Performance Counter-based    (HPC) approach to validate COPPA-compliance of Android apps.

ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,Is Personalization Worth It? Notifying Blogs about a Privacy Issue    Resulting from Poorly Implemented Consent Banners,,2024,,38,,,"Several websites integrate trackers without users' consent. Previous    research studied whether notifying responsible website operators about    such issues is an effective measure, often with limited success.    Insights from marketing research suggest that personalizing notification    emails may be an effective means to improve remediation rates, with    previous research pointing in both directions. We studied this approach    using a sample of 119 German fitness and sports blogs employing Google    Analytics (GA) without user consent: In a first step, we compare the fix    rate of blog operators that received a personalized notification    tailored to their blog with the fix rate of operators that received a    generic notification.

Can It Be    Intercepted?,,2018,239,,301-319,,"We explore the ecosystem of smartphone applications with respect to    their privacy practices towards sensitive user data. In particular, we    examine 96 free mobile applications across 10 categories, in both the    Apple App Store and Google Play Store, to investigate how securely they    transmit and handle user data. For each application, we perform wireless    packet sniffing and a series of man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks to    capture personal identifying information, such as usernames, passwords,    etc. During the wireless packet sniffing, we monitor the traffic from    the device when a specific application is in use to examine if any    sensitive data is transmitted unencrypted. At the same time, we reveal    and assess the list of ciphers that each application uses to establish a    secure connection. During the MITM attacks, we use a variety of methods    to try to decrypt the transmitted information.    The results show that although all tested applications establish a    secure TLS connection with the server, 85\% of them support weak    ciphers. Additionally, 60\% of iOS and 25\% of Android applications    transmit unencrypted user data over the Wi-Fi network. By performing a    MITM attack we capture the username, password, and email in various    apps, e.g. Instagram, Blackboard, Ebay, and Spotify. We manage to bypass    certificate pinning in 75\% of the iOS applications, including Facebook.    Finally, we observe that data is being forwarded to third party domains    (mostly to domains that belong to Google and Apple).",SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",Proceedings Paper,English,"Anthi, E (Corresponding Author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Comp Sci \& Informat, Cardiff, Wales.

IEEE,Implementation of Two Factor Authentication (2FA) and Hybrid Encryption    to Reduce the Impact of Account Theft on Android-Based Instant Messaging    (IM) Applications,,2020,,,119-123,,"Instant messaging is an application that is widely used to communicate.    Based on the wearesocial.com report, three of the five most used social    media platforms are chat or instant messaging. Instant messaging was    chosen for communication because it has security features in log in    using a One Time Password (OTP) code, end-to-end encryption, and even    two-factor authentication. However, instant messaging applications still    have a vulnerability to account theft. This account theft occurs when    the user loses his cellphone. Account theft can happen when a cellphone    is locked or not. As a result of this account theft, thieves can read    confidential messages and send fake news on behalf of the victim. In    this research, instant messaging application security will be applied    using hybrid encryption and two-factor authentication, which are made    interrelated. Both methods will be implemented in 2 implementation    designs. The implementation design is securing login and securing    sending and receiving messages. For login security, QR Code    implementation is sent via email. In sending and receiving messages, the    message decryption process will be carried out when the user is    authenticated using a fingerprint. Hybrid encryption as message security    uses RSA 2048 and AES 128.

The receiver can retrieve the encrypted files containing    specific keywords by providing the corresponding trapdoors of these    keywords to the server. Despite their merits, the existing PEKS schemes    introduce a high end-to-end delay that may hinder their adoption in    practice. Moreover, they do not scale well for large security parameters    and provide no post-quantum security promises. In this paper, we propose    two novel lattice-based PEKS schemes that offer a high computational    efficiency along with better security assurances than that of the    existing alternatives. Specifically, our NTRU-PEKS scheme achieves 18    times lower end-to-end delay than the most efficient pairing-based    alternatives.

This paper introduces a novel approach for cryptographic message    authentication where this problem does not arise: A linkable message    tagging scheme (LMT) identifies pairs of messages and accompanying    authentication tags as related if and only if these tags were created    using the same secret key. Importantly, our primitive fully avoids    public keys and hence elegantly sidesteps the key distribution problem    of signature schemes. As an application of LMT we envision an email    authentication system with minimal user interaction. Email clients could    routinely equip all outgoing messages with corresponding tags and verify    for incoming messages whether they indeed originate from the same entity    as previously or subsequently received messages with identical sender    address. As technical contributions we formalize the notions of LMT and    its (more efficient) variant CMT (classifiable message tagging),    including corresponding notions of unforgeability. For both variants we    propose a range of provably secure constructions, basing on different    hardness assumptions, with and without requiring random oracles.

The most    commonly applied technique is asymmetric cryptography, which is    generally executed in the background without the user even being aware.    It establishes a cryptographic code based on the computational    complexity of mathematical problems. However, this type of cryptography,    which is widely used in today's telecommunications systems, is under    threat as electronics and computing rapidly develop. The development of    fifth-generation cellular networks (5G) is gaining momentum, and given    its wide field of application, security requires special attention. This    is especially true faced with the development of quantum computers. One    solution to this security challenge is to use more advanced techniques    to establish cryptographic keys that are not susceptible to attack. An    essential part of quantum cryptography, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)    uses the principles of quantum physics to establish and distribute    symmetric cryptographic keys between two geographically distant users.    QKD establishes information-theoretically secure cryptographic keys that    are resistant to eavesdropping when they are created. In this paper, we    survey the security challenges and approaches in 5G networks concerning    network protocols, interfaces and management organizations. We begin by    examining the fundamentals of QKD and discuss the creation of QKD    networks and their applications. We then outline QKD network    architecture and its components and standards, following with a summary    of QKD and post-quantum key distribution techniques and approaches for    its integration into existing security frameworks such as VPNs (IPsec    and MACsec). We also discuss the requirements, architecture and methods    for implementing the FPGA-based encryptors needed to execute    cryptographic algorithms with security keys.

Search engine-based,    third-party assisted tools and blacklist/whitelist fail to identify new    phishing attacks resulting in high FPR. Heuristic and visual similarity    approaches are slow, whereas URL and web content-based techniques do not    mimic the dynamic content of current websites and hence cannot stop    zero-day attacks. A study was conducted to understand the critical    features used in the past for anti-phishing, and we found 16 HTTP header    features that were novel. In this paper, we have developed a real-time,    highly scalable, feature-rich anti-phishing detection technique based on    ML that extracts the HTTP headers (predominantly security headers) from    web pages to identify them as legitimate or phished. It is observed that    phishing sites are short-lived and are created to achieve a specific    objective, like stealing the credential of a user. Once the goal is met,    the sites are pulled down immediately. Hence these sites do not take    pain to use the security features of web technology and only focus on    making the site as similar as possible to the original website. Test    results based on our novel features show high accuracy of 97.8\% with an    average response time of 1.57 s. We have created multiple datasets for    different scenarios, like a dataset for website creation through    phishing tools and a new dataset for testing unseen phishing attacks.

Although many solutions have emerged, they suffer from the    following: 1) privacy provided is insufficient as the email content or    detection rules may be exposed to third parties; 2) due to improper use    of encryption, exhaustive word search attacks are possible, potentially    breaking the confidentiality of encrypted emails; 3) when spam filtering    is outsourced, email is given to the outsource, where user privacy may    be compromised if privacy protection measures are not properly put in    place; 4) confirmation of whether the encrypted email is spam is only    determined after the receiver receives the email, which can lead to a    situation in which spam is loaded to the memory of the receiver's    terminal for spam filtering. This can be harmful, for example, when an    attacker inserts a web browser vulnerability into the body of an email    to lure users to a phishing site simply by reading the email; 5)    computationally expensive operations are unavoidable to provide required    features of privacy-preserving spam filtering.

"Fryer, Huw and Stalia-Bourdillon, Sophie and Chown, Tim",Malicious web pages: What if hosting providers could actually do    something...,COMPUTER LAW \& SECURITY REVIEW,2015,31,4,490-505,AUG,"The growth in use of Internet based systems over the past 20 years has    seen a corresponding growth in criminal information technologies    infrastructures. While previous ``worm{''} based attacks would push    themselves onto vulnerable systems, a common form of attack is now that    of drive-by download. In contrast to email or worm-based malware    propagation, such drive-by attacks are stealthy as they are `invisible'    to the user when doing general Web browsing. They also increase the    potential victim base for attackers since they allow a way through the    users firewall as the user initiates the connection to the Web page from    within their own network. This paper introduces some key terminology    relating to drive-by downloads and assesses the state of the art in    technologies which seek to prevent these attacks. This paper then    suggests that a proactive approach to preventing compromise is required.    The roles of different stakeholders are examined in terms of efficacy    and legal implications, and it is concluded that Web hosting providers    are best placed to deal with the problem, but that the system of    liability exemption deriving from the E-Commerce Directive reduces the    incentive for these actors to adopt appropriate security practices.

To prevent these attacks,    researchers have responded with a number of protection systems.    Currently, the methods which cyber-attackers use to conduct attacks is    associated with exploiting humans. Such attacks are recorded more    frequently than before, and they are more challenging to control.    Traditional security countermeasures are unable to prevent breaches    targeting the human element. This paper describes the state of the art    of cyber security attacks, countermeasures, and protection tools related    to everyday online activities. It provides a useful cyber-attack    taxonomy and classification which helps to involve in a protection    process to identify attacks and measures for cyber security. Existing    protection schemes that target the cyber threats and risks are evaluated    against three of our criteria for an effective measure: resilience to    cyber-attacks' countermeasures; real-time support and needs-based    action; and training and educational materials to increase users'    awareness of cybercrimes.

Self-sampling has been proven as a suitable alternative approach to help    improve management STIs by improving access to diagnosis among    vulnerable populations. We sought to determine health workers'    perspectives on user-friendly self-sampling interventions for STIs among    young women in eThekwini District Municipality.MethodsHealthcare workers    providing STI healthcare services in the study location participated in    a nominal group technique (NGT) workshop. The NGT workshop was aimed    enabling collaboration with key health providers in identifying    user-friendly self-sampling interventions for diagnosis of STIs among    young women. Data collection was conducted in two phases: phase 1    determined barrier that hinder young women from accessing current STI    healthcare services and phase 2 focused on determining the key    strategies for self-sampling interventions to diagnose STIs in young    women. Thematic analysis and percentage form analysis were used to    examine qualitative and quantitative data respectively.ResultsThe    following barriers were identified: negligence; myths about STIs; fear    of judgement; denial; operating hours; lack of knowledge of STI symptoms    and safe sex practices; and stigma associated with STIs. The following    strategies were suggested: hand out self-sampling kits at popular    restaurants; collect self-sampling kits from security guard at primary    healthcare clinics (PHCs); receive STI diagnostic results via SMS or    email or the clinic for treatment; improve youth friendly services at    PHCs; educate the public on proper use of the kits. Education about STIs    and handing out self-sampling kits at clinics, universities, schools,    pharmacies or via outreach teams were ranked high priority    strategies.ConclusionsThe findings highlight the need to address stigma    and fear of judgment and provide comprehensive education to improve    healthcare-seeking behaviour in young women.

The underground mining industry is one of the industries    which, due to its nature, was not able to switch to remote work.    Conducting traditional training risked spreading the virus among    workers. For this purpose, it was necessary to start a search for a form    of training that would be safe and would not cause additional stress for    employees. Research on the development of an active employee training    method and testing of the method itself was conducted online. In order    to develop a method of active training, one of the most important    workstations was selected, which is the operation of the conveyor belt.    The training method comprises four training modules. The modules cover    questions related to the operation of the conveyor belt, emergencies,    its assembly and disassembly, repair and maintenance. The developed    issues also take into account questions concerning natural hazards and    work safety. The entire training course lasts 10 days.

"Kashi, Edden and Zavou, Angeliki",Did I Agree to This? Silent Tracking Through Beacons,,2020,12210,,427-444,,"Users' personally identifiable information (PII) collection is a primary    revenue model for the app-economy, and consequently user tracking has    become increasingly invasive and ubiquitous. Smart and IoT devices    provide even more access to users' personal information by utilizing    their exact location and default device settings. Although users in most    cases must grant permission before their personal information is    collected and shared with third-parties, this is not the case when user    tracking happens through email or just by owning and using Bluetooth    dependent devices. In any case, the average user is willing to accept    the terms of the often unread ``Privacy Policy{''} in order to receive    the advertised ``better user experience{''}, without really being aware    of the consequences of this decision. In this work, we investigate the    latest popular technologies for user tracking through mobile and web    applications and demonstrate how much information about users can be    gathered without user awareness or acknowledgment as well as in which    cases and how we were able to limit this tracking. Finally, in our work,    we attempt to create unified user profiles by combining our findings    from the different tracking techniques against targeted users. We hope    that our extensive analysis of beacon tracking will lead to greater    awareness of the privacy risks involved with web beacons and Bluetooth    tracking and motivate the deployment of stricter regulations and a more    effective notification mechanism when such tracking is in place.",SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",Proceedings Paper,English,"Kashi, E; Zavou, A (Corresponding Author), Hofstra Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Hempstead, NY 11550 USA.

As    part of the Smart Pillbox study, a cluster-randomized controlled trial    of an electronic pillbox designed to reduce medication discrepancies and    improve medication adherence after hospital discharge, we explored    barriers to successful implementation and evaluation of this    intervention. Methods Eligible patients were those admitted to a    medicine service of a large teaching hospital with a plan to be    discharged home on five or more chronic medications. The intervention    consisted of an electronic pillbox with pre-filled weekly blister pack    medication trays given to patients prior to discharge. Pillbox features    included alarms to take medications, detection of pill removal from each    well, alerts to patients or caregivers by phone, email, or text if    medications were not taken, and adherence reports accessible by    providers. Greater than 20\% missed doses for three days in a row    triggered outreach from a pharmacist. To identify barriers to    implementation and evaluation of the intervention, we reviewed patient    exit surveys, including quantitative data on satisfaction and free-text    responses regarding their experiences; technical issue logs; and team    meeting minutes. Themes were derived by consensus among the study    authors and organized using the Consolidated Framework for    Implementation Research. Results Barriers to implementation included    intervention characteristics such as perceived portability issues with    the pillbox and time required by pharmacists to enter medication    information into the software; external policies such as lack of    insurance coverage for early refills and regulatory prohibitions on    repackaging medications; implementation climate issues such as the    incompatibility between the rushed nature of hospital discharge with the    time required to deploy the intervention; and patient issues such as    denial of previous problems with medication adherence. We founds several    obstacles to conducting the study, including patients declining study    enrollment and limited attempts by the hospital to streamline logistics    by building the intervention into usual care. Several solutions to    address many of these challenges were implemented or planned. Despite    these challenges, many patients with the pillbox were pleased with the    service and believed the intervention worked well for them. Conclusions    In this evaluation, several barriers to implementing and conducting a    study of the effectiveness of the intervention were identified.

IEEE COMPUTER SOC,Universal Neural-Cracking-Machines: Self-Configurable Password Models    from Auxiliary Data,,2024,,,1365-1384,,"We introduce the concept of ``universal{''} password model-a password    model that, once pre-trained, can automatically adapt its guessing    strategy based on the target system. To achieve this, the model does not    need to access any plain-text passwords from the target credentials.    Instead, it exploits users' auxiliary information, such as email    addresses, as a proxy signal to predict the underlying password    distribution.    Specifically, the model uses deep learning to capture the correlation    between the auxiliary data of a group of users (e.g., users of a web    application) and their passwords. It then exploits those patterns to    create a tailored password model for the target system at inference    time. No further training steps, targeted data collection, or prior    knowledge of the community's password distribution is required.    Besides improving over current password strength estimation techniques,    the model enables any end-user (e.g., system administrators) to    autonomously generate tailored password models for their systems without    the often unworkable requirements of collecting suitable training data    and fitting the underlying machine learning model. Ultimately, our    framework enables the democratization of well-calibrated password models    to the community, addressing a major challenge in the deployment of    password security solutions at scale.",IEEE COMPUTER SOC,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Pasquini, D (Corresponding Author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, SPRING Lab, Lausanne, Switzerland.

USENIX ASSOC,Understanding the Viability of Gmail's Origin Indicator for Identifying    the Sender,,2023,,BV7II,77-96,,"The current design of email authentication mechanisms has made it    challenging for email providers to establish the authenticity of email    messages with complicated provenance, such as in the case of forwarding    or third-party sending services, where the purported sender of an email    is different from the actual originator. Email service providers such as    Gmail have tried to address this issue by deploying sender identity    indicators (SIIs), which seek to raise users' awareness about where a    message originated and encourage safe behavior from users. However, the    success of such indicators depends heavily on user interpretation and    behavior, and there exists no work that empirically investigates these    aspects. In this work, we conducted an interactive survey (n=180) that    examined user comprehension of and behavior changes prompted by Gmail's    passive SII, the `via' indicator. Our quantitative analysis shows that    although most participants (89\%) noticed the indicator, it did not have    a significant impact on whether users would adopt safe behaviors.    Additionally, our qualitative analysis suggests that once prompted to    consider why `via' is presented, the domain name displayed after `via'    heavily influenced participants' interpretation of the message `via' is    communicating.

We present a    normative model of the effects of alerting and blocking on the value of    the outcomes, on measures of risk-taking, and on the number of    successful attacks. We compared warning and blocking systems and    binaryand likelihood-alarm systems as a function of properties of the    threats and the security system. We also compared model predictions to    actual user behavior, as measured in a controlled experiment. The    experimental results were generally in line with the normative model.    However, the model predicted that the outcomes from blocking would    always be worse or equal to those from warnings. The experiment,    however, showed that blocking may have an advantage over warnings,    because it leads to fewer undetected events (as predicted by the model),    without significantly lowering the mean value of outcomes (the model    predicts a lower value). We discuss practical implications regarding the    use of blocking and alerting and the more general value of combining    optimal decision models and empirical experiments for determining system    designs.

Design/methodology/approach In a simulated field trial conducted in a    financial institute, via PhishMe, employees were randomly sent one of    five possible emails using a set persuasion strategy. Participants were    then invited to complete an online survey to identify possible    protective factors associated with clicking and reporting behavior (N =    2,918). The items of interest included perceived threat severity, threat    susceptibility, response efficacy and personal efficacy. Findings The    results indicate that response behaviors vary significantly across    different persuasion strategies. Perceptions of threat susceptibility    increased the likelihood of reporting behavior beyond clicking behavior.    Threat susceptibility and organizational response efficacy were also    associated with increased odds of not responding to the simulated    phishing email attack. Practical implications This study again    highlights human susceptibility to phishing attacks in the presence of    social engineering strategies. The results suggest heightened awareness    of phishing threats and responsibility to personal cybersecurity are key    to ensuring secure business environments. Originality/value The authors    extend existing phishing literature by investigating not only    click-through behavior, but also no-response and reporting behaviors.

Design: Rapid response online survey. Participants completed the    six-item US Household Food Security Survey Module, a brief measure of    food insufficiency, and measures of food behaviours, neighbourhood    safety and discrimination. Open-ended questions were used to assess    changes in eating behaviours during COVID-19 and needed resources.    Setting: C-EAT (COVID-19 Eating and Activity over Time) study    invitations were sent by email and text message to a longitudinal    cohort.    Participants: A total of 218 emerging adults (mean age = 24.6 (sd 2.0)    years, 70.2 \% female) completed a survey in April-May 2020 during a    stay-at-home order in Minnesota.    Results: The past year prevalence of food insecurity was 28.4 \%. Among    food-insecure respondents, 41.0 \% reported both eating less and    experiencing hunger due to lack of money in the past month.    Food-insecure respondents were less likely than those who were food    secure to have fruits/vegetables at home and more likely to have    frequent fast-food restaurant meals, feel unsafe in their neighbourhood    and experience discrimination during the stay-at-home order.    Food-insecure adults reported changes including eating more food    prepared at home, eating more take-out restaurant meals and purchasing    more energy-dense snacks as a result of events related to COVID-19.    Resources most needed to support their health included eligibility for    more food assistance and relief funds.

ACM,Context-based Clustering to Mitigate Phishing Attacks,,2022,,,115-126,,"Phishing is by far the most common and disruptive type of cyber-attack    faced by most organizations. Phishing messages may share common    attributes such as the same or similar subject lines, the same sending    infrastructure, similar URLs with certain parts slightly varied, and so    on. Attackers use such strategies to evade sophisticated email filters,    increasing the difficulty for computing support teams to identify and    block all incoming emails during a phishing attack. Limited work has    been done on grouping human-reported phishing emails, based on the    underlying scam, to help the computing support teams better defend    organizations from phishing attacks. In this paper, we explore the    feasibility of using unsupervised clustering techniques to group emails    into scams that could ideally be addressed together. We use a    combination of contextual and semantic features extracted from emails    and perform a comparative study on three clustering algorithms with    varying feature sets. We use a range of internal and external validation    methods to evaluate the clustering results on real-world email datasets.

This cross-sectional study explored    participants' understanding of their health condition, their preferences    for receiving health communications, and their interest in receiving    clinical trial results across several therapeutic areas.MethodsThe study    recruited participants via social media, email newsletters, and advocacy    organizations. An online screener captured demographic information    (health conditions, age, race/ethnicity, gender, and education).    Eligible participants were emailed an online survey assessing preferred    sources and formats for receiving health information, interest in    learning about topics related to the results of clinical trials, and    health literacy levels.ResultsIn total, 449 participants (median age, 35    years {[}range, 18-76]; White, 53\%; higher education, 65\%; mean    (range) health literacy score, 1.9 {[}0.4-3.0]) from 45 US states    completed the survey representing 12 disease indications (bipolar, blood    and solid tumor cancers, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel    disease, major depressive disorder, migraine, Parkinson's,    psoriasis/atopic dermatitis, retinal vein occlusion/macular    degeneration, rheumatoid arthritis, and spasticity). Healthcare    providers were the preferred source of health information (59\%),    followed by Internet searches (11\%). Least preferred sources were    social media (5\%), friends/family (3\%), and email newsletters (2\%).    Participants preferred multiple formats and ranked reading materials    online as most preferred (33\%), along with videos (28\%) and    infographics (27\%). Printed materials (14\%) and audio podcasts (9\%)    were the least preferred formats. A majority of the participants    reported that the health information they found was hard to understand    (57\%) and confusing (62\%). Most participants (85\%) were somewhat/very    interested in learning about clinical trial results, with the highest    interest in short summaries of safety (78\%) and efficacy (74\%)    results.ConclusionEffective health communication may be achieved via    multiple formats shared directly by healthcare providers.    Researchers wanted to learn how people preferred to receive    health-related communications, including information about the results    of clinical trials.

It also    asked about their interest in learning about clinical trials related to    their health condition. The results showed that most people preferred to    get health information from their healthcare providers (59\%). The    Internet was the second most popular choice (11\%) for getting health    information. People did not like getting health information from social    media, friends or family, or email newsletters as much.

In    addition, attackers can create Customized Malware that hide their    malicious payload until the identifier of the target-specific system can    be verified. In this paper, we propose an attack scenario in which    adversaries can leverage publicly available personally identifiable    information present in the target system as specific identifiers. The    proposed attack scenario can be used in targeted attacks, especially    against hosts that store business email addresses on personal computers    (PCs). We investigated a set of desktop applications and specified 18    popular applications that store email addresses in their related files    or directories. We also implemented a survey tool to access these    applications and record whether email addresses were found. We then    asked nine laboratory members and staff if the target-specific email    address was found and if we could extract the same email address from    each PC with 16 applications. Finally, we implemented a dummy malware    sample that searches for the target host's email address from the    executing environment and denies unpacking the malicious payload if the    mark does not exist. The experiment results demonstrate that two modern    malware security appliances did not detect the prototype sample. To    defend against the proposed attack, we discuss countermeasures from both    the sandbox and user perspective.

Adversaries are detected if they    access fake files. Though previous works have mainly focused on using    user data files as decoys, this concept can be applied to system files.    If so, it is expected to be effective in detecting malicious users    because it is very difficult to commit an attack without accessing a    single system file. However, it may suffer from excessive false alarms    by legitimate system services such as file indexing and searching.    Legitimate users may also access fake files by mistake. This paper    addresses this issue by introducing a hidden interface. Legitimate users    and applications access files through the hidden interface which does    not show fake files. The hidden interface can also be utilized to hide    sensitive files by hiding them from the regular interface. By    experiments, we demonstrate the proposed technique incurs negligible    performance overhead, and it is an effective countermeasure to various    attack scenarios and practical in that it does not generate false alarms    for legitimate applications and users.",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Article,English,"Lee, J (Corresponding Author), Korea Univ, Sch Cybersecur, Seoul 02841, South Korea.

ACM,Influence of URL Formatting on Users' Phishing URL Detection,,2023,,,318-333,,"Despite technical advances in anti-phishing protection, in many cases    the detection of phishing URLs largely depends on users manually    inspecting the links found in suspicious emails. One solution proposed    to support users in doing so is to use a URL formatting that focuses    their attention on critical URL parts, such as domain and    top-level-domain (called ``who-area{''}). While this solution has been    implemented in several software products (e.g., browsers web address    bar), research on its effectiveness with regard to phishing URL    detection is currently limited. To investigate the extent to which    different kinds of URL formatting support users to detect phishing URLs,    we conducted an online study (n = 200) using interactive email    screenshots with tooltips showing two previously evaluated URL    formatting (called ``Who-Area Highlighting{''} and ``Who-Area Only{''}).    A group with unmodified URLs (called ``Plain URL{''}) acted as control.    We did not find any significant difference between the URL formatting    within our sample, with successful phishing URL detection rates ranging    from 71\% (for the unmodified URL) to 76\% (for showing only the URL    who-area). As we designed a study with a ``best-case{''} scenario to    detect a medium effect size (Cohen's r = .30), it is then likely that    the URL formatting effect on phishing URL detection would be even    smaller in the real world. Still, we found that other factors had a    significant effect on users' phishing URL detection, namely,    gender-related factors and forcing users' attention on the URL for 4-5    seconds. However, these results are only preliminary and need further    investigation.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Proceedings Paper,English,"Mossano, M (Corresponding Author), Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Karlsruhe, Germany.

Further, the modern smart buildings    increase operational efficiency, safety, and consumer comfort, where,    all the operations are monitored/controlled by central monitoring and    control unit (CMCU). For reliable communication between the components    of smart building and the CMCU, a well-established network with advanced    features such as user alerts, usage details, remote control, link    failure handling, security, etc., is essential. However, the    conventional IoT network can't provide all these features, especially    the fault tolerance, where, communication failure is usually observed in    remote control operations when there exists any link failure. This is    the major drawback of conventional networks. To overcome this issue,    this paper proposes a retrofitted IoT based communication network with    Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP) for remote monitoring and control of    smart building devices. This proposed network provides a redundant path    during the link failures, thereby ensures reliable communication in the    network. This is the major contribution of this paper. Besides, this    network possesses advanced features viz., Adaptive Security Appliance    (ASA) firewall to provide intrusion prevention (blocking unauthorized    packets), Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol to enable    the broker for broadcasting messages to all the subscribers of a    particular topic, and email alert to provide communication between    different users.

IEEE,Identification and prevention of social engineering attacks on an    enterprise,,2019,,,,,"In recent times, the integration of technology in everyday tasks helps    in making most of the cumbersome work more convenient. This integration    has brought about a positive wave in aiding and assisting humans in    various sectors such as the military, health, education, finance, etc.    Conversely, convenience does come with a cost, i.e. it increases the    concern for security in those systems. Attackers with various motives    try to exploit these systems for personal gain. Some of the popular    attacks like Man In The Middle, Cross-Site Request Forgery(CSRF),    Phishing and Code Injection can be used to compromise the systems.    However, the easiest way to gain control over a system is through Social    engineering because it can be performed within a short time and without    much technical expertise. Social Engineering targets humans by using    various psychological weaknesses of human cognizance. Such attacks are    often used to attack enterprises, as their weakest links are the human    employees who are prone to be deceived and manipulated. Hence, the    enterprise must be prepared for any kind of attack that may be deployed    to exploit the weaknesses. This paper discusses the broad spectrum of    Social Engineering threats that an enterprise faces throughout its life    and various effective measures to prevent such attacks.

Government agencies and medical    institutions have encouraged people to use medical information    technology (MIT) to manage their conditions and promote personal health.    In 2014, Taiwan established the first electronic personal health record    (PHR) platform, My Health Bank (MHB), which allows people to access and    manage their PHRs at any time. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic in    2020, Taiwan has used MIT to effectively prevent the spread of COVID-19    and undertaken various prevention measures before the onset of the    outbreak. Using MHB to purchase masks in an efficient and orderly way    and thoroughly implementing personal protection efforts is highly    important to contain disease spread.    Objective: This study aims to understand people's intention to use the    electronic PHR platform MHB and to investigate the factors affecting    their intention to use this platform.    Methods: From March 31 to April 9, 2014, in a promotion via email and    Facebook, participants were asked to fill out a structured questionnaire    after watching an introductory video about MHB on YouTube. The    questionnaire included seven dimensions: perceived usefulness, perceived    ease of use, health literacy, privacy and security, computer    self-efficacy, attitude toward use, and behavioral intention to use.    Each question was measured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from    ``strongly disagree{''} (1 point) to ``strongly agree{''} (5 points).    Descriptive statistics and structural equation analysis were performed    using SPSS 21 and AMOS 21 software.    Results: A total of 350 valid questionnaire responses were collected    (female: 219/350, 62.6\%; age: 21-30 years: 238/350, 68.0\%;    university-level education: 228/350, 65.1\%; occupation as student:    195/350, 56.6\%; average monthly income <NT \$30,000 {[}<US \$1054.89]:    230/350, 65.7\%; residence in northern Taiwan: 236/350, 67.4\%; and    health status perceived as ``good{''}: 171/350, 48.9\%). Five    indicators, including chi-square test (X-310(2)=2.63), goodness-of-fit    index (0.85), adjusted goodness-of-fit index (0.81), comparative fit    index (0.91), and root mean square error of approximation (0.07), were    calculated. The results indicated a good fit. Further analysis indicated    that the most important factor affecting respondents' behavioral    intention to use MHB was their attitude toward use (0.78), followed by    perceived ease of use (0.65), perceived usefulness (0.41), health    literacy (0.10), and privacy and security (0.07).    Conclusions: From the perspective of the populace, this study explored    the factors affecting the use of MHB and constructed an interpretation    model with a strong goodness of fit. The results of our analysis are    consistent with the technology acceptance model. Through the diverse    value-added services of MHB, Taiwan's experience in pandemic prevention    with smart technology can facilitate future responses to unknown,    emerging infectious diseases.","JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC","130 QUEENS QUAY East, Unit 1100, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",Article,English,"Chu, CM (Corresponding Author), Natl Def Med Ctr, Sch Publ Hlth, 4F,161 Min Chun E Rd,Sec 6, Taipei, Taiwan.

"Wodo, Wojciech and Stygar, Damian",PSD2 Compliant Hardware Token for Digital Banking,,2021,,,,,"This paper is related to the introduction of Payment Services Directive    2 (PSD2) and associated with it Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) and    dynamic linking mechanisms. As a consequence of these regulations, some    of the transaction authorization methods (aka TANs) must be withdrawn -    for instance regular hardware tokens or printed one-time passwords    cards. We propose easy to implement adjustment for well-known    hardware-based tokens, which make them PSD2 compliant. As a    proof-of-concept for our solution, we incorporated our designed protocol    based on TOTP (Time -based One Time Password) algorithm and prepared a    working prototype in a form of full operating system example. During our    investigation we showed that users do not have to rely on One Time    Password (OTP) mechanisms based on Short Message Service (SMS) codes or    smartphone applications for generating TANs, which are forced by    financial institutions and raises doubts regarding the 1 evel of    security or availability. In our approach, we divide communications    channels between bank and user into three independent parts    {[}web-service (two-ways, main channel), text message/email (one way,    notification c hannel), h ardware t oken (one way, OTP generating    channel)]. Corrupting one of the channels is not enough to take over the    control of the user bank account.

In addition, the implementation often has to adhere to    legal standards. In this paper, we aim to investigate current practice    of data use in online participations. In particular, a qualitative    analysis is conducted and 18 online participations are investigated on    their data use, i.e. use of participant information, cookies and web    analytics. The results show that most projects require and request data    during site visits (e.g., IP address, browser type) and for active    participation (e.g., name, email). The real benefit, however, for the    use of web analytics is often unclear. Furthermore, often proprietary    solutions for web analytics are used, even tough open source solutions    (i.e. that store data locally) exist.

The position of vehicle is transmitted    via a wireless network using cellular telephone network known as GSM    (Global System for Mobile communication). A vehicle that has GPS    receiver installed onboard connected with GPRS modem and connected to a    computer system in the Internet can be monitored and then provide alert    when it travels outside the predefined area. This area is very important    for many situations such as city car rental, trucking company to send    goods from one city to another and logistic company with many fleets.    The system designed here is a module with a GPS and a GPRS already    integrated in one module. The output of the GPS receiver is connected to    a microcontroller. The microcontroller dictates which data is collected    via the GPS receiver and then sends the information to a computer system    via GPRS modem. The microcontroller also receives command from the    computer system via the GPRS connection and then can acct accordingly,    such as change the frequency of geo-coordinate or turn the vehicle    engine off if necessary. This device will help the user to track its    vehicle via Google Map with the GPS coordinate data sent to the database    server every 10. This device will enable the operator to turn off the    vehicle engine and one other device onboard the vehicle if necessary.    With the feature of Geofence on the Web server using HTML5, a virtual    fence has been built around the Google Map and when the vehicle moving    outside the fence the user can be alerted either via email or color    change on the web page.

To protect    the user information, it is required to detect malicious actions in the    IoT environment. Even though different threat detection methods are    introduced in the IoT technology, detecting malicious activity is still    a significant challenge in the communication network. Hence, in this    research work, an effective Cuckoo Search Chicken Swarm (CSCS)    optimisation algorithm is proposed to detect the malicious threat in the    network effectively. At first, the user activity information is    simulated from the IoT network and stored in the user activity log. The    user activity log file is forwarded to the feature extraction module,    where the features, like logon, device, file, email, and Hypertext    Transfer Protocol (HTTP) are extracted using the window length. For each    user, the features are extracted with respect to the time stamp. Then,    the dynamic feature index is constructed, and the threat detection is    performed using the deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classifier, which    is trained using the proposed CSCS algorithm. The proposed CSCS    algorithm is designed by integrating the Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm    and the Chicken Swarm Optimisation (CSO) algorithm. Moreover, the    proposed algorithm attained better performance with respect to the    metrics, like namely F1-score, precision, and recall as 0.915, 0.975,    and 0.884 by varying the k-value and 0.9286, 0.9235, and 0.9337 by    varying the training data using window size as 10, respectively.",TAYLOR \& FRANCIS LTD,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Rajeyyagari, S (Corresponding Author), Shaqra Univ, Coll Comp \& Informat Technol, Shaqra, Saudi Arabia.

Web-based technologies, including smartphones,    are novel means to enable evidence-based care and improve patient    outcomes.    Objective: The aim of this study was to design, develop, and assess the    utilization of an asthma collaborative self-management (CSM) platform    (breathe) using content based on international evidence-based clinical    guidelines.    Methods: We designed and developed breathe as a Web-based mobile health    (mHealth) platform accessible on smartphones, tablets, or desktop with    user-centered design methods and International Organization for    Standardization-certified quality development processes. Moreover,    breathe was envisioned as a multifunctional, CSM mHealth platform, with    content based on international clinical practice guidelines and    compliant with national privacy and security specifications. The system    enabled CSM (patient, provider, and breathe) and self-monitoring of    asthma patients through (1) assessment of asthma control, (2) real-time    access to a dynamic asthma action plan, (3) access to real-time    environmental conditions, and (4) risk-reduction messaging. The data    collection protocol collected user data for 12 months, with clinic    visits at baseline and 6 and 12 months. Utilization outcomes included    user interactions with the platform, user impressions, self-reported    medication use, asthma symptom profile, reported peak flow measurement,    and the delivery and impact of email reminders.    Results: We enrolled 138 patients with a mean age of 45.3 years to    receive the breathe intervention. Majority were female (100/138,    72.5\%), had a smartphone (92/138, 66.7\%), and had a mean Asthma    Control Test score of 18.3 (SD 4.9). A majority reported that breathe    helped in the management of their asthma. Moreover, breathe scored 71.1    (SD 18.9) on the System Usability Scale. Overall, 123 patients had    complete usage analytics datasets. The platform sent 7.96 reminder    emails per patient per week (pppw), patients accessed breathe 3.08    times, journaled symptoms 2.56 times, reported medication usage 0.30    times, and reported peak flow measurements 0.92 times pppw. Furthermore,    breathe calculated patients' action plan zone of control 2.72 times    pppw, with patients being in the green (well-controlled) zone in 47.71\%    (8300/17,396) of the total calculations. Usage analysis showed that    67.5\% (83/123) of the participants used the app at week 4 and only    57.7\% (71/123) by week 45. Physician visits, email reminders, and aged    50 years and above were associated with higher utilization.    Conclusions: Individuals with asthma reported good usability and high    satisfaction levels, reacted to breathe notifications, and had    confidence in the platform's assessment of asthma control. Strong    utilization was seen at the intervention's initiation, followed by a    rapid reduction in use. Patient reminders, physician visits, and being    aged 50 years and above were associated with higher utilization.","JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC","130 QUEENS QUAY East, Unit 1100, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",Article,English,"Morita, PP (Corresponding Author), Univ Waterloo, Fac Appl Hlth Sci, Sch Publ Hlth \& Hlth Syst, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada.

IEEE,Privacy Risks with Facebook's PII-based Targeting: Auditing a Data    Broker's Advertising Interface,,2018,,BK7UT,89-107,,"Sites like Facebook and Google now serve as de facto data brokers,    aggregating data on users for the purpose of implementing powerful    advertising platforms. Historically, these services allowed advertisers    to select which users see their ads via targeting attributes. Recently,    most advertising platforms have begun allowing advertisers to target    users directly by uploading the personal information of the users who    they wish to advertise to (e.g., their names, email addresses, phone    numbers, etc.); these services are often known as custom audiences.    Custom audiences effectively represent powerful linking mechanisms,    allowing advertisers to leverage any PII (e.g., from customer data,    public records, etc.) to target users.    In this paper, we focus on Facebook's custom audience implementation and    demonstrate attacks that allow an adversary to exploit the interface to    infer users' PII as well as to infer their activity. Specifically, we    show how the adversary can infer users' full phone numbers knowing just    their email address, determine whether a particular user visited a    website, and de-anonymize all the visitors to a website by inferring    their phone numbers en masse. These attacks can be conducted without any    interaction with the victim(s), cannot be detected by the victim(s), and    do not require the adversary to spend money or actually place an ad. We    propose a simple and effective fix to the attacks based on reworking the    way Facebook de-duplicates uploaded information. Facebook's security    team acknowledged the vulnerability and has put into place a fix that is    a variant of the fix we propose. Overall, our results indicate that    advertising platforms need to carefully consider the privacy    implications of their interfaces.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Venkatadri, G (Corresponding Author), Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA.

They protect sensitive    information (e.g., private keys) from malicious applications. However,    they do not protect the owner from abuse of the smart card: An    application could for example cause a smart card to digitally sign any    message, at any time, without the knowledge of the owner.    In this paper we suggest that small, hand-held computers can be used    instead of smart cards. They can communicate with the user directly and    therefore do not exhibit the above mentioned problem.    We have implemented smart card functionality for a 3COM PalmPilot. Our    implementation is a PKCS\#11 module that plugs into Netscape    Communicator and takes about 5 seconds to sign an email message.    Generalizing from this experience, we argue that applications that are    split: between a PC and a hand-held device can be more secure. While    such an application remains fast and convenient to use, it gains    additional security assurances from the fact that part of it runs on a    trusted device.",USENIX ASSOC,"SUITE 215, 2560 NINTH ST, BERKELEY, CA 94710 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.

However, obtaining IPD is    time-consuming and contact with the researchers responsible for the    original trials is usually required. To date, there are no studies    evaluating different strategies to optimize the process for retrieval of    IPD from such researchers. Our aim is to examine the impact of providing    incentives to the researchers responsible for the trials eligible for a    meta-analysis to submit their IPD.    Methods/Design: We updated our previously published systematic reviews    for type 1 diabetes mellitus comparing long-and intermediate-acting    insulin regimens (from January 2013 to June 2015) and for Alzheimer's    dementia comparing cognitive enhancers (from January 2015 to May 2015).    Eligible were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) fulfilling the    eligibility criteria of the systematic reviews. We will randomly    allocate authors of the reports of these RCTs into an intervention or    control group. Those allocated to the intervention group will be    contacted by email, mail, and phone, and will be asked to provide the    IPD from their RCT and will be given a financial incentive. Those    allocated to the control group will be contacted by email, mail, and    phone, but will not receive a financial incentive. Our primary outcome    will be the proportion of authors who provide the IPD. The secondary    outcomes will be the time to return the dataset (defined as the period    between the information request and the authors' response with the    dataset), and completeness of data. We will compare the response rates    in the two groups using the odds ratio and the corresponding 95 \%    confidence interval. We will also use binary logistic regression and cox    regression analyses to examine whether different RCT characteristics,    such as study size and sponsor information, influence the probability of    providing IPD and the time needed to share the data.    Discussion: This study will determine whether a financial incentive    affects response rates when seeking IPD from the original researchers.    We will disseminate our findings in an open access scientific journal    and present results at national and international conferences.",BMC,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Tricco, AC (Corresponding Author), St Michaels Hosp, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Inst, 209 Victoria St,East Bldg, Toronto, ON M5B 1T8, Canada.

C.",Catching the Phish: Detecting Phishing Attacks Using Recurrent Neural    Networks (RNNs),,2020,11897,,219-233,,"The emergence of online services in our daily lives has been accompanied    by a range of malicious attempts to trick individuals into performing    undesired actions, often to the benefit of the adversary. The most    popular medium of these attempts is phishing attacks, mainly through    emails and websites. In order to defend against such attacks, there is    an urgent need for automated mechanisms to identify this malicious    content before it reaches users. Machine learning techniques have    gradually become the standard for such classification problems. However,    identifying common measurable features of phishing content (e.g., in    emails) is notoriously difficult. To address this problem, we engage in    a novel study into a phishing content classifier based on a recurrent    neural network (RNN), which identifies such features without human    input. At this stage, we scope our research to emails, but our approach    can be extended to apply to websites. Our results show that the proposed    system outperforms state-of-the-art tools. Furthermore, our classifier    is efficient and takes into account only the text and, in particular,    the textual structure of the email. Since these features are rarely    considered in email classification, we argue that our classifier can    complement existing classifiers with high information gain.",SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",Proceedings Paper,English,"Halgas, L (Corresponding Author), Univ Oxford, Dept Comp Sci, Oxford, England.

Identity leakage is an emerging threat to the security of    user accounts because the number of online identities grows notably    faster than the amount of used email adresses and passwords.    In order to protect users against potential identity thefts after a    cyber heist, a system that proactively warns the victims seems    inevitable. In the design of such a system, there are technical, legal    and psychological goals, e.g., the system has to fulfill the General    Data Protection Regulation and users do not want to be flooded with    warnings about potential identity thefts.    In this paper, we propose a warning management system for online service    providers that want to cooperate whilst keeping their users' data    private from each other. Most importantly, victims will be informed only    once if their user identity was found in an identity leak and the    cooperating service providers preserve the privacy of the victims by    design.

A product personalization    design platform is a critical direction for the Metaverse's future    development, enhancing user experience by offering personalized    services. Blockchain technology ensures the security and privacy of user    data, and enables personalized services through smart contracts,    offering opportunities for personalization platforms. However,    blockchain's decentralization can lead to excessive product data,    resulting in ineffective data management and optimization, subsequently    confusing personalized product design styles, which diminishes user    experience. To address these issues, this study proposes the product    style automatic generation system (PSAGS), centered on an image    generation unit. The system outputs images with style information based    on the input product text, achieving precise quantization and    visualization of product styles, thereby enhancing user engagement and    loyalty to the Metaverse. The image generation unit, with a    standardization module can standardize the product style, namely, the    relationship between product design elements and user emotions,    addressing the problem of managing vast style data due to blockchain's    decentralization. The generation module utilizes a diffusion model    enhanced with contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) to generate    style images, deepening the Metaverse experience. Optimizations include    dilation convolution in the UNet architecture to enhance image quality    and fine-grained CLIP transformations for improved image and text    alignment.

Farm vehicle crash    interventions have focused on the farm equipment (e.g., lighting and    marking) or the farm vehicle operator (e.g., training), despite crashes    being most frequently caused by other vehicle driver actions.    Community-based campaigns focused on rural drivers have potential to    influence driver behavior. The objective of this study was to describe    the role, formation, and lessons learned from a community advisory board    (CAB) in the development and dissemination of a community-based rural    roadway safety campaign. Methods: The CAB provided campaign input    through quarterly meetings and email. The campaign had three main CAB    and crash data-informed messages: 1) Slow Down, 2) Leave More Space, and    3) Avoid Passing. The CAB led campaign activities to publicize the    message, distribute swag, and organize event logistics. To evaluate CAB    effectiveness and inform future community engagement efforts, we    conducted in-depth, semi-structured telephone interviews with CAB    members in July 2020. Interviews were transcribed, coded, and codes were    categorized into five main themes. Results: Overall, CAB membership was    described as an overwhelmingly positive experience in terms of the CAB    structure, culture fostered among the group, responsibilities, and time    commitment. Board members reported successful campaign implementation,    gave positive feedback regarding the research team's engagement efforts,    and provided valuable recommendations for future campaigns (e.g., adding    social media components, expansion of CAB age and industry diversity,    and increasing group bonding activities). Conclusions: Results from this    study demonstrate the instrumental role and logistics involved in    engagement of community advisors for the development and implementation    of a rural roadway safety campaign.

The corporates and other    organizations store a large amount of information that is primarily    disseminated in the form of emails that include personnel information of    the user, employee, and customers. The security aspects of PII storage    have been ignored, raising serious security concerns onindividual    privacy. A significant concern arises about comprehending the    responsibilities regarding the uses of PII. However, in real-time    scenarios, email data is regarded as unstructured text data, detecting    PII from such an unstructured large text corpus is quite challenging.    This paper presents an intelligent clustering approach for automatically    detecting personally identifiable information (PII) from a large text    corpus. The focus of the proposed study is to design a model that    receives text content and detects possible PII attributes. Therefore,    this paper presents a clustering-based PII Model (C-PPIM) based on NLP    and unsupervised learning to address detection of PH in the unstructured    large text corpus. NLP is used to perform topic modeling, and Byte    mLSTM, a different approach of sequence model, is implemented to address    clustering problems in PII detection. The performance analysis of the    proposed model is carried out existing hierarchical clustering    concerning silhouette and cohesion score. The outcome indicated the    effectiveness of the proposed system that highlights significant PH    attributes, with significant scope in real-time implementation. In    contrast, existing techniques are too expensive to function and fit in    real-time environments.",SCIENCE \& INFORMATION SAI ORGANIZATION LTD,"19 BOLLING RD, BRADFORD, WEST YORKSHIRE, 00000, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Kulkarni, P (Corresponding Author), RV Coll Engn, Dept ISE, Bengaluru, India.

Smartphone operating systems such as Android and iOS have made    it possible for anyone with development skills to create apps for    smartphones. This has enabled smartphone users to download and install    applications from stores such as Google Play, App Store, and several    other third-party sites. During installation, these applications request    resource access permissions from users. The resources include hardware    and software like contact, memory, location, managing phone calls,    device state, messages, camera, etc. As per Google's permission policy,    it is the responsibility of the user to allow or deny any permissions    requested by an app. This leads to serious privacy violation issues when    an app gets illegal permission granted by a user (e.g., an app might    request for granted map permission and there is no need for map    permission in the app, and someone can thereby access your location by    this app). This study investigates the behavior of the user when it    comes to safeguarding their privacy while installing apps from Google    Play. In this research, first, seven different applications with    irrelevant permission requests were developed and uploaded to two    different Play Store accounts. The apps were live for more than 12    months and data were collected through Play Store analytics as well as    the apps' policy page. The preliminary data analysis shows that only    20\% of users showed concern regarding their privacy and security either    through interaction with the development team through email exchange or    through commenting on the platform and other means accordingly.",MDPI,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Article,English,"Hanif, M (Corresponding Author), Lulea Tekniska Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Elect \& Space Engn, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden.

In response to known disparities in screening uptake, all    Black patients were assigned to receive mailed + electronic    outreach.ResultsAmong patients quasi-randomly assigned to an    intervention (non-Black patients), the 180-day FIT completion rate was    18.8\% in the electronic outreach only group (n = 1,318) and 25.0\% in    the mailed + electronic outreach group (n = 1,364) (difference 6.2\%    {[}95\% CI 3.0, 9.4]).

"Byington, Katherine W. and Schwebel, David C.",Effects of mobile Internet use on college student pedestrian injury risk,ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION,2013,51,,78-83,MAR,"Background: College-age individuals have the highest incidence of    pedestrian injuries of any age cohort. One factor that might contribute    to elevated pedestrian injuries among this age group is injuries    incurred while crossing streets distracted by mobile devices.    Objectives: Examine whether young adult pedestrian safety is compromised    while crossing a virtual pedestrian street while distracted using the    Internet on a mobile ``smartphone.{''}    Method: A within-subjects design was implemented with 92 young adults.    Participants crossed a virtual pedestrian street 20 times, half the time    while undistracted and half while completing an email-driven ``scavenger    hunt{''} to answer mundane questions using mobile Internet on their cell    phones. Six measures of pedestrian behavior were assessed during    crossings. Participants also reported typical patterns of street    crossing and mobile Internet use.    Results: Participants reported using mobile Internet with great    frequency in daily life, including while walking across streets. In the    virtual street environment, pedestrian behavior was greatly altered and    generally more risky when participants were distracted by Internet use.    While distracted, participants waited longer to cross the street    (F=42.37), missed more safe opportunities to cross (F=42.63), took    longer to initiate crossing when a safe gap was available (F=53.03),    looked left and right less often (F=124.68), spent more time looking    away from the road (F=1959.78), and were more likely to be hit or almost    hit by an oncoming vehicle (F=29.54; all ps<0.01). Results were retained    after controlling for randomized order; participant gender, age, and    ethnicity; and both pedestrian habits and mobile Internet experience.    Conclusion: Pedestrian behavior was influenced, and generally    considerably riskier, when participants were simultaneously using mobile    Internet and crossing the street than when crossing the street with no    distraction. This finding reinforces the need for increased awareness    concerning the risks of distracted pedestrian behavior. (C) 2012    Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the review, the text-based cross-context    recommendation algorithm extracts user/item comment information in the    auxiliary context to alleviate the target context's data sparsity    problem and improve recommendation accuracy. A cross-context    recommendation strategy based on self-attention-based federated learning    (SAFL) is suggested in this work. In contrast to current algorithms,    SAFL fully mixes the target and auxiliary background information.    Federated learning addresses crucial challenges including data privacy,    data security, data access rights, and access to heterogeneous data by    allowing several players to develop a single, strong machine learning    model without sharing data. To begin, self-attention mechanism is    introduced to model the user's preference information; then, the    information from one field is used to improve the recommendation    accuracy of another area; and finally, the information from the two    contexts is integrated into the knowledge fusion module and the score    prediction module to predict the score.

Descriptive statistics and group    comparisons across the 2 sources of recruitment methodology were    utilized to quantify and characterize fraudulent activity.Results Of the    2,781 eligible screeners completed, 1,725 (62\%) were determined to be    fraudulent prior to randomization, detected most commonly by duplicate    identifiers (65\%) and/or VPN and proxy detection (47\%). Of the 258    randomized participants, 51 (20\%) were later determined to be    fraudulent based upon age and/or DOB mismatch. Notable patterns in    fraudulent activity (e.g., 42\% of fraudulent screening respondents    reported the exact age of 30 years; stylistic formatting of email    address accounts) were identified. The fraudulent recruitment rate was    higher for social media advertising (85\%) than survey panels    (26\%).Conclusions Both social media and survey panel recruitment    resulted in high levels of fraudulent activity in a DCT of a mobile    mental health intervention. Researchers conducting DCTs and/or online    surveys are urged to take several precautions and preventative measures    to insulate against fraudulent activity including embedding identity    verification procedures in consent processes. Researchers should    consider making personal contact with a participant to verify identity    as well as remain vigilant for fraudulent activity and its real-time    dynamic potential.Trial Registration NCT04925570.    Fully remote decentralized trial, what's your fraud prevention plan?    This study shares hard-earned lessons, metrics, and preventive    strategies to help insulate against fraudulent enrollment efforts in    research.    Research that is done virtually (i.e., without face-to-face contact) can    open up opportunities to participate. However, fully remote research    runs the risk of attracting people who misrepresent themselves to gain    research payments. The current study was conducted fully remotely and    aimed to evaluate an 8-week mobile app for reducing substance use.    People were recruited via social media and from online survey panels.    The study offered up to \$100 for participation. Notably, the research    team determined that over 60\% of people seeking to join the study were    not legitimate. To detect fraud, the research team used tools to    identify masked or encrypted internet activity, checked for duplicated    emails and phone numbers, and looked for discrepancy in reported age and    birthdate. Even after participants were enrolled, another 1 in 5 were    later identified as fraudulent. Fraud was especially problematic via    social media recruitment channels. The findings highlight the need for    stronger safeguards in online research, such as verifying identities    during consent and maintaining real-time monitoring throughout the    study.",OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",Article,English,"Moore, JB (Corresponding Author), Stanford Univ, Stanford Prevent Res Ctr, Sch Med, Dept Med, Palo Alto, CA 94305 USA.

To protect sensitive data from being compromised, the most    widely used method is encryption. However, simply encrypting data (e.g.,    via AES) cannot fully address the practical need of data management.    Besides, an effective access control over download request also needs to    be considered so that Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDoS) attacks    cannot be launched to hinder users from enjoying service. In this    article, we consider the dual access control, in the context of    cloud-based storage, in the sense that we design a control mechanism    over both data access and download request without loss of security and    efficiency.

It    makes available a very easy-to-deploy environment, which once installed,    is ready to be used. These two characteristics, make it a very    attractive choice. But regarding information security and privacy, it    presents several and important drawbacks. This is mainly due to the fact    that it leaves the most serious tasks, like server configuration or    access control in the hands of the system administrator or third-party    module developers. This approach is understandable, as is that very fact    what makes Moodle easy and therefore attractive.

This research explores a largely ignored, but crucial aspect    of phishing: the adversarial behavior. We aim at understanding human    behaviors and strategies that adversaries use, and how these may    determine the end-user response to phishing emails. We accomplish this    through a novel experiment paradigm involving two phases. In the    adversarial phase, 105 participants played the role of a phishing    adversary who were incentivized to produce multiple phishing emails that    would evade detection and persuade end-users to respond. In the end-user    phase, 340 participants performed an email management task, where they    examined and classified phishing emails generated by participants in    phase-one along with benign emails. Participants in the adversary role,    self-reported the strategies they employed in each email they created,    and responded to a test of individual creativity. Data from both phases    of the study was combined and analyzed, to measure the effect of    adversarial behaviors on end-user response to phishing emails. We found    that participants who persistently used specific attack strategies    (e.g., sending notifications, use of authoritative tone, or expressing    shared interest) in all their attempts were overall more successful,    compared to others who explored different strategies in each attempt. We    also found that strategies largely determined whether an end-user was    more likely to respond to an email immediately, or delete it. Individual    creativity was not a reliable predictor of adversarial performance, but    it was a predictor of an adversary's ability to evade detection. In    summary, the phishing example provided initially, the strategies used,    and the participants' persistence with some of the strategies led to    higher performance in persuading end-users to respond to phishing    emails. These insights may be used to inform tools and training    procedures to detect phishing strategies in emails.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",Article,English,"Rajivan, P (Corresponding Author), Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dynam Decis Making Lab, Social \& Decis Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.

A real-time accident detection and    response mechanism is proposed that utilizes the ResNet deep learning    algorithm to automatically identify and classify accidents based on the    severity based on streaming camera feed. ResNet is so capable of feature    extraction that accidents are classified with almost-absolute accuracy:    minor or major ones. In the case of a major accident, messages are sent    automatically to the police and the nearest hospitals, with the reminder    email being sent if action is not taken within seconds, ensuring a    relatively swift response. In the case of minor accidents, reports are    made to the police immediately. Furthermore for future work our system    will have an integrated human detection module based on SSD-MobileNet    counts the bystanders at the accident scene and provides valuable    information on public response. The proposed approach uses one of the    most contemporary deep learning algorithms to improve detection    classification and to ensure a completely automated alert system that    enables timely and coordinated emergency response, reducing response    time and contributing towards safer roads.",IEEE COMPUTER SOC,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Sabitha, R (Corresponding Author), Rajalakshmi Engn Coll, Dept CSE, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.

Despite    the prevalence of the procedure, stigma surrounding abortion in Canada    leads to barriers for women to access this service. The vast majority of    care is concentrated in urban settings. There is evidence to support    utilization of innovative mobile and other technology solutions to    empower women to safely and effectively self-manage aspects of the    abortion process. This study is part 1 of a 3-phase study that utilizes    user-centered design methodology to develop a digital health solution to    specifically support follow-up after an induced surgical abortion.    Objective: This study aimed to (1) understand how women at 3 surgical    abortion clinics in an urban center of British Columbia utilize their    mobile phones to access health care information and (2) understand    women's preferences of content and design of an intervention that will    support follow-up care after an induced abortion, including    contraceptive use.    Methods: The study design was based on    development-evaluation-implementation process from Medical Research    Council Framework for Complex Medical Interventions. This was a    mixed-methods formative study. Women (aged 14-45 years) were recruited    from 3 urban abortion facilities in British Columbia who underwent an    induced abortion. Adaptation of validated surveys and using the    technology acceptance model and theory of reasoned action, a    cross-sectional survey was designed. Interview topics included    demographic information; type of wireless device used; cell phone usage;    acceptable information to include in a mobile intervention to support    women's abortion care; willingness to use a mobile phone to obtain    reproductive health information; optimal strategies to use a mobile    intervention to support women; understand preferences for health    information resources; and design qualities in a mobile intervention    important for ease of use, privacy, and security. Responses to questions    in the survey were summarized using descriptive statistics. Qualitative    analysis was conducted with NVivo using a thematic analysis approach.    This study was approved by the local ethics board.    Results: A waiting-room survey was completed by 50 participants, and    semistructured interviews were completed with 8 participants. The    average age of participants was 26 years. Furthermore, 94\% (47/50)    owned a smartphone, 85\% (41/48) used their personal phones to go    online, and 85\% would use their cell phone to assist in clinical care.    Qualitative analysis demonstrated that women prefer a comprehensive    website that included secure email or text notifications to provide    tools and resources for emotional well-being, contraceptive decision    making, general sexual health, and postprocedure care.    Conclusions: A community-based mixed-methods approach allowed us to    understand how women use their cell phones and what women desire in a    mobile intervention to support their postabortion care. The findings    from this formative phase will assist in the development and testing of    a mobile intervention to support follow-up care after an induced    surgical abortion.","JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC","59 WINNERS CIRCLE, TORONTO, ON M4L 3Y7, CANADA",Article,English,"Gill, R (Corresponding Author), Univ British Columbia, Womens Hlth Res Inst, Dept Obstet \& Gynaecol, 4500 Oak St, Vancouver, BC, Canada.

IEEE,Mining for Norms in Clouds Complying to Ethical Communication through    Cloud Text Data Mining,,2012,,,327-332,,"As the world is realizing the power and efficiency of cloud computing,    enhanced security and intelligence is needed in communication to filter    out unethical data violating norms in clouds. No filtering    categorization has been currently proposed. Numerous lists of banned,    unethical and objectionable words have been developed with limited user    satisfaction. Lists are usually manually generated, with some    programmable extensibility for online forums and public newsgroups. We    define a tool and methodology to categorize the censor data. We    statistically grow words in the categorized data and tag the hidden    neutral words with meaning in context. Using Computational Linguistics    tools and modifying them to suit our means, we analyze sample text from    gigabytes of email newsgroup dataset over Cloud Servers. A sample result    dataset of the most frequently used words breaking the norms in recent    cloud communication is presented in the results in broad categories. The    categories separate cloud-server data found in newsgroups related to    internet crimes, fraud, theft, anti-state elements, and other material    of legal importance.

Given that the effectiveness    of these attacks heavily relies on poor human decision making, an    improved understanding of the individual characteristics that increase    cybersecurity vulnerability could inform more targeted training. The    current study aimed to identify whether several factors, including    phishing email detection ability, confidence in one's phishing    identification decisions, general attitudes towards one's level of    responsibility and efficacy, and employee satisfaction and loyalty to    the organization, may predict behavior in a naturalistic phishing    simulation in an employment setting. We followed up employees of a large    organization who had been recently targeted by a phishing simulation and    asked them to complete a survey that included a phishing detection task.    The employees' behavior in the phishing simulation was ranked according    to its safety: reporting the suspicious email, neither reporting nor    clicking on the embedded link, and clicking on the link. We found that    fewer years of employment at the organization and lower employee    satisfaction and loyalty predicted increasingly unsafe behavior in the    simulation. This suggests that newer and unsatisfied employees are most    vulnerable to phishing attempts and might benefit most from targeted    cybersecurity training. \& COPY; 2023 The Authors.

ACM,An Intelligent Technique To detect file formats and E-Mail Spam,,2010,,,,,"With the everyday increasing importance of privacy, security, and wise    use of computational resources, the corresponding technologies are    increasingly being faced with the problem of file type detection. In    digital forensic, there are numerous file formats in use. Criminals have    started using either non-standard file formats or changing extensions of    files while storing or transmitting them over a network. This makes    recovering data out of these files difficult. An extension to the file    name with the file type is stored in the disk directory, but when a file    is deleted, the entry for the file in the directory may be overwritten    and hence quite difficult to identify its type which is serious issue in    computer forensics. But if the fragment of file has its header    information containing type identifying information the mentioned    problem may be solved. But it is difficult to identify the type of    fragment from the middle or if the header information is deleted or    unavailable the identification becomes more complex. This paper focuses    on identifying the file types addressing the various scenarios of file    type being changed by the malicious user to send some confidential or    sensitive information by changing the file type (say.exe banned by Gmail    can be converted to any acceptable format and sent across). E-mail spam    has become an epidemic problem that can negatively affect the usability    of electronic mail as a communication means. Besides wasting users' time    and effort to scan and delete the massive amount of junk e-mails    received, it consumes network bandwidth and storage space, slows down    e-mail servers, and provides a medium to distribute harmful and/or    offensive content. Inspired by the success of fuzzy similarity in text    classification and document retrieval, the approach investigates its    effectiveness in filtering spam based on the textual content of e-mail    messages.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Dhanalakshmi, R (Corresponding Author), Anna Univ, Dept Comp Sci \& Engn, Madras 60025, Tamil Nadu, India.

Attackers have not been    slow to capitalize on the vulnerabilities of this mechanism by using    social engineering techniques to coerce users to forward authentication    codes. We demonstrate one social engineering attack for which we    experimentally obtained a 50\% success rate against Google's SMS-based    authentication. At the heart of the problem is the messaging associated    with the authentication code, and how this must not have been developed    with security against social engineering in mind. Pursuing a top-down    methodology, we generate alternative messages and experimentally test    these against an array of social engineering attempts. Our most robust    messaging approach reduces the success of the most effective social    engineering attack to 8\%, or a sixth of its success against Google's    standard second factor verification code messages.

ED is a    transdiagnostic dimension characterized by an excessive reactivity to    negative emotional stimuli with affective (anger) and behavioral    (aggression) components, and is present across anxiety, mood and    behavioral disorders. Due to early onset, high prevalence and    persistence, ED in childhood is one of the most psychosocially impairing    and cost-intensive mental health conditions, with not enough children    improving with conventional treatments. Clinical trials have established    preliminary efficacy of micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) in the    treatment of ED. This project expands the research to examine    micronutrient efficacy for teenagers with ED.Methods: This study is the    first double-blind (participant and investigators) 8 week randomized    controlled trial (with 8 week open-label extension and one year    follow-up) designed to explore the efficacy and safety of micronutrients    compared with placebo in 150 medication-free emotionally dysregulated    youth (12-17 years), referred via self-referral, delivered remotely    throughout New Zealand, using a website for monitoring symptoms, with a    psychologist available online via text, email and video for assessment    and monitoring. The primary outcome measures will be the Clinical Global    Impression (CGI-I), the reactivity subscale of the Emotion    Dysre-gulation Inventory (EDI) and the Clinician Rated Temper and    Irritability Scale (CL-ARI).Discussion: Micronutrient intervention    delivered alongside online assessment and monitoring has the potential    to transform delivery of mental health care to young people who may not    be willing or able to access traditional therapies.

We propose the    use of nudges - more specifically social saliency nudges - that aim to    highlight important information to the user when evaluating emails. We    used Signal Detection Theory to assess the effects of both sender    saliency (highlighting important fields from the sender) and receiver    saliency (showing numbers of other users in receipt of the same email).    Sender saliency improved phish detection but did not introduce any    unwanted response bias. Users were asked to rate their confidence in    their own judgements and these confidence scores were poorly calibrated    with actual performance, particularly for phishing (as opposed to    genuine) emails.

The ePOCS (electronic patient-reported    outcomes from cancer survivors) project aims to develop and evaluate a    cost-efficient, UK-scalable electronic system for collecting    patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), at regular post-diagnostic    timepoints, and linking these with clinical data in cancer registries.    METHODS: A multidisciplinary team developed the system using agile    methods. Design entailed process mapping the system's constituent parts,    data flows and involved human activities, and undertaking usability    testing. Informatics specialists built new technical components,    including a web-based questionnaire tool and tracking database, and    established component-connecting data flows. Development challenges were    overcome, including patient usability and data linkage and security.    RESULTS: We have developed a system in which PROMs are completed online,    using a secure questionnaire administration tool, accessed via a    public-facing website, and the responses are linked and stored with    clinical registry data. Patient monitoring and communications are    semiautomated via a tracker database, and patient correspondence is    primarily Email-based. The system is currently honed for clinician-led    hospital-based patient recruitment.    CONCLUSIONS: A feasibility test study is underway. Although there are    possible challenges to sustaining and scaling up ePOCS, the system has    potential to support UK epidemiological PROMs collection and clinical    data linkage.

Priority targets for the campaign included laboratory    personnel and men who have sex with men with specific risk criteria.    Primary immunization involved two doses of the Imvanex/Jynneos vaccine,    followed by a single booster dose. We conducted a study in two Italian    towns, Bologna and Forl ì, in October and November 2022 to investigate    adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) of the monkeypox vaccine    through participant-based active surveillance. Participants who received    the vaccine and were aged 18 and over were invited to complete an    e-questionnaire by scanning a QR code during their second vaccine    appointment or by email one month after the booster dose. A descriptive    analysis of AEFI incidences was conducted, with the results stratified    by type and severity of symptoms. A total of 135 first-dose, 50    second-dose, and 6 single-dose recipients were included, with a mean age    of 36.4 \& PLUSMN; 8.7 years. Systemic reactions after the first and    second doses were reported by 39.3\% and 26.0\% of participants,    respectively, with asthenia being the most common symptom. Local site    reactions were reported by 97.0\% and 100.0\% of participants,    respectively, with redness, swelling, and itching being the most common    local AEFIs. Grade 3 or 4 AEFIs were reported for local AEFIs only by    16.8\% and 14.0\% of participants after the first and second doses,    respectively. Our findings suggest that the monkeypox vaccine has a high    tolerability profile in terms of short-term common systemic AEFIs.

IEEE,Simulation of PKI-Enabled Communication for Identity Management Using    CyberCIEGE,,2010,,,906-911,,"CyberCIEGE is a sophisticated network security simulation packaged as a    video game and used by educators around the world to enhance information    assurance education and training at universities, community colleges,    within the DoD, and in other government agencies. The CyberCIEGE game    engine was recently expanded to include Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)    features including certification authorities, selection of installed    roots and cross certification. CyberCIEGE Virtual Private Network (VPN)    gateways, VPN clients and email clients were then extended to    incorporate the new PKI features. CyberCIEGE PKI abstractions are    described in terms of player configuration choices and the consequences    of these choices on network management and vulnerabilities. The    CyberCIEGE game engine modifications include modeling of chains of trust    and risks of cross certification schemes. The benefits of these    enhancements include coherent integration of identity management    technologies, ranging from the human interface through to the supporting    distributed infrastructure, into scenarios. Benefits also include    support for recent new scenarios focused on the PKI infrastructure,    identity management, or both; and the ability to tie both identity    management and PKI to concepts of identification, authentication,    provenance, and access control.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Irvine, CE (Corresponding Author), USN, Postgrad Sch, Monterey, CA 93943 USA.

"Ding, XH and Tsudik, G",Simple identity-based cryptography with mediated RSA,,2003,2612,BW74K,193-210,,"Identity-based public key encryption facilitates easy introduction of    public key cryptography by allowing an entity's public key to be derived    from an arbitrary identification value, such as name or email address.    The main practical benefit of identity-based cryptography is in greatly    reducing the need for, and reliance on, public key certificates.    Although some interesting identity-based techniques have been developed    in the past, none are compatible with popular public key encryption    algorithms (such as El Gamal and RSA). This limits the utility of    identity-based cryptography as a transitional step to full-blown public    key cryptography. Furthermore, it is fundamentally difficult to    reconcile fine-grained revocation with identity-based cryptography.    Mediated RSA (mRSA) {[}9] is a simple and practical method of splitting    a RSA private key between the user and a Security Mediator (SEM).    Neither the user nor the SEM can cheat one another since each    cryptographic operation (signature or decryption) involves both parties.    mRSA allows fast and fine-grained control of users' security privileges.    However, mRSA still relies on conventional public key certificates to    store and communicate public keys. In this paper, we present IB-mRSA, a    simple variant of mRSA that combines identity-based and mediated    cryptography. Under the random oracle model, IB-mRSA with OAEP {[}7] is    shown as secure (against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack) as standard    RSA with OAEP. Furthermore, IB-mRSA is simple, practical, and compatible    with current public key infrastructures.",SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",Article; Proceedings Paper,English,"Ding, XH (Corresponding Author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Informat \& Comp Sci, Irvine, CA 92717 USA.

However, compression can    inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities to compression side channel    attacks (CSCA), which exploit the relationship between data redundancy    and compression size to infer sensitive information. In this paper, we    introduce Prexion, a novel compression system designed to counter CSCA    while maintaining high compression efficiency. Prexion leverages a    probabilistic mechanism to selectively include or exclude overlapping    sequences in web page data during compression, making it difficult for    attackers to exploit patterns in compressed sizes. This approach    preserves the benefits of compression without compromising security.    Through extensive experiments with real-world web pages, Prexion    demonstrates superior performance, achieving up to 4.9 times better    compression ratios than the current state-of-the-art solution, Debreach,    for web pages with significant amounts of sensitive data.

"Kyaw, Thu Ya and Ng, Andrew Keong",Smart Aquaponics System for Urban Farming,,2017,143,,342-347,,"Food security and sustainability is a major concern for Singapore due to    its rapid urbanization, land scarcity, and low local food productions of    fish and leafy vegetables. This paper attempts to design and develop a    smart aquaponics system that can synergize fish farming and plant    growing. Various sensors, actuators, microcontroller, and microprocessor    were employed in the system to monitor and control water quality, light    intensity, and fish feed. To ensure healthy growing environment for fish    and plant, early warnings in form of email, short message service, and    push notification are automatically sent to the user when the sensor    detects any abnormal condition. Concurrently, the respective actuator    will intervene and rectify the abnormal condition without human    interference. Moreover, fish feed is dispensed at the user preset    timings of the day. All system activities and live sensor measurements    are securely stored in a cloud storage for data analysis. User-friendly    web and mobile applications were also created to provide graphical user    interfaces between the aquaponics system and the user. Additionally, the    user can monitor the aquaponics facilities live from web application    through a camera module of the system. As such, the proposed smart    aquaponics system has demonstrated to be a self-sustainable,    cost-effective, and eco-friendly urban farming that can attract    commercial farmers and home gardeners.

Data loss prevention (DLP)    systems are used for minimization of risks related to internal threats.    The main function of the DLP systems is to prevent leak of confidential    data; however, comparison of the DLP systems relies currently on their    capabilities to analyze information captured and convenience of carrying    out retrospective investigations of information security incident. In    the paper, a new approach to retrospective analysis of user's text    information is presented. The idea of the proposed approach consists in    topic analysis of the text content processed by the user in the past and    prediction of further user behavior with content. User text content can    cover different categories, including confidential ones. The topic    analysis of user text content assumes determination of main topics and    their weights for given past time intervals. Based on deviations of    behavior of user's operations with a content from the forecast, one can    reveal time intervals when operation with documents of one or another    category differs from normal (historical) work and when the user worked    with documents of unusual categories.

"Harn, Lein and Ren, Jian and Lin, Changlu",Design of DL-based certificateless digital signatures,JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE,2009,82,5,789-793,MAY,"Public-key cryptosystems without requiring digital certificates are very    attractive in wireless communications due to limitations imposed by    Communication bandwidth and computational resource of the mobile    wireless communication devices. To eliminate public-key digital    certificate, Shamir introduced the concept of the identity-based    (ID-based) cryptosystem. The main advantage of the ID-based cryptosystem    is that instead of using a random integer as each user's public key as    in the traditional public-key systems, the user's real identity, such as    user's name or email address, becomes the user's public key. However,    all identity-based signature (IBS) schemes have the inherent key escrow    problem, that is private key generator (PKG) knows the private key of    each user. As a result, the PKG is able to sign any message on the    users' behalf This nature violates the ``non-repudiation{''} requirement    of digital signatures. To solve the key escrow problem of the IBS while    still taking advantage of the benefits of the IBS, certificateless    digital signature (CDS) was introduced. In this paper, we propose a    generalized approach to construct CDS schemes. In our proposed CDS    scheme, the user's private key is known only to the user himself,    therefore, it can eliminate the key escrow problem from the PKG. The    proposed construction can be applied to all Discrete Logarithm    (DL)-based signature schemes to convert a digital signature scheme into    a CDS scheme. The proposed CDS scheme is secure against adaptive    chosen-message attack in the random oracle model. In addition, it is    also efficient in signature generation and verification.

USENIX Assoc,Secure mobile code execution service,,2006,,,53-62,,"Mobile code refers to programs that come into a host computer over the    network and start to execute with or without a user's knowledge or    consent. Because these programs run in the execution context of the user    that downloads them, they can issue any system calls that the user is    allowed to make, and thus pose a serious security threat when they are    malicious. Although many solutions have been proposed to solve the    malicious mobile code problem, none of them are truly effective at    striking a good balance between defeating zero-day attacks and    minimizing disruption to the execution of legitimate applications.    This paper describes a commercial system called SEES that secures the    execution of mobile code that comes into a host computer as an email    attachment or as a web document downloaded through an anchor link by    running them on a separate guinea pig machine rather than on the user    machine. Effectively, it takes an isolation approach to the secure    mobile code execution problem. As a result, SEES guarantees that no    malicious email attachments or web documents that act on behalf of the    user that downloads them, can damage the resources of the user machine,    or can leak any confidential information. In particular, even zero-day    virus cannot cause any harms.

In these situations, virtual    communication tools have helped maintain interaction between parties.    The Frontline Connect program was designed to address communication and    patient care challenges by providing data-enabled devices to clinical    staff in hospitals. Objective This study aimed to identify areas of    improvement for the Frontline Connect program by: (a) evaluating    communication needs, user experience, and program satisfaction; and (b)    identifying potential barriers to device access or use. Methods We    administered pre-implementation needs assessment, post-use, and exit    surveys to healthcare staff at a pilot hospital site in Ontario.    Recruitment was through email lists and site champions using convenience    sampling. We descriptively analysed survey responses and compared the    initial need statements to post-implementation use-cases identified by    users. Results We received 139 needs assessments, 31 user experience    assessments, and 47 exit survey responses. Most device use occurred in    the emergency department and intensive care units and was facilitated by    social workers, nurses, and physicians to connect patients, families,    and care providers. Pre-implementation concerns were related to    infection control, data security, and device privacy. In the exit    survey, these were replaced by other concerns including Internet    connectivity and time-intensiveness. Device utility and ease-of-use were    rated 9.7/10 and 9.6/10 respectively in the user experience survey,    though overall experience was rated 7.2/10 in the exit survey. Overall,    respondents viewed the devices as useful and we agree with participants    who suggested increased program promotion and training would likely    improve adoption. Conclusions We found that our virtual technology    program for facilitating communication was positively perceived. Survey    feedback indicates that a rapid rollout in response to urgent    pandemic-related needs was feasible, though program logistics could be    improved.

These trusted components are then linked together via Type    Enforcement to form a pipeline, with one input channel for data to enter    the guard, and one separate, connected output channel for data to exit    the guard. These channels are connected via assured processes whose    behavior is restricted by the Type Enforcement mechanism. Furthermore,    Type Enforcement is also used to isolate many components of the guard,    which simplifies the assurance arguments.

However,    these systems face potential privacy challenge. The privacy challenge    arises from the necessity for external service providers to collect and    process user interaction data. The untrustworthiness of these providers    may lead to privacy breaches, compromising the overall security of such    DApp environments. To address this challenge, we model the interaction    data in the DApp environments as dynamic graphs and propose a dynamic    graph publication method named HMG (Hidden Markov Model for Dynamic    Graphs). HMG estimates the interaction probabilities between users by    extracting the temporal information from historically collected data and    constructs an optimized model to generate synthetic graphs. The    synthetic graphs can preserve the dynamic topological characteristics of    the interaction processes within DApp environments while effectively    protecting user privacy, thus assisting external service providers in    performing effective analyses. Finally, we evaluate the performance of    HMG using real-world datasets and benchmark it against commonly used    graph metrics. The results demonstrate that the synthetic graphs    preserve essential features, making them suitable for analysis by    service providers.",IEEE COMPUTER SOC,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",Article,English,"Liu, HL (Corresponding Author), Xiangtan Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Xiangtan 411105, Peoples R China.

This will    help us understand the rationale behind and consequences of    hallucinogenic drug use. METHOD - Respondents were recruited at several    internet fora for individual email-mediated interviews (n = 5) or group    interviews in public discussion threads (n = 11). They were    predominantly males in their 30s or 40s with stable jobs and living    conditions and extensive hallucinogen experience. RESULTS - Both    positive and adverse consequences were assessed, and respondents    emphasised the capacity of hallucinogenic drugs for healing and personal    growth; even adverse experiences ({''}bad trips{''}) were regarded as    valuable for these purposes. The dependence potential of these drugs was    regarded as low because of an inherent self-regulatory mechanism whereby    positive effects disappear with overuse. A minority of participants    reported mental health problems that may result from their hallucinogen    use, but the majority have experienced no significant adverse reactions    after many years of use. This should be seen in light of the low    frequency of their hallucinogen use. CONCLUSION - The study obtained    evidence of a predominantly male group of mature users taking    hallucinogens in carefully prepared sessions for the purpose of personal    spiritual growth, acknowledging some risks but also several benefits    from this practice.",SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Johnstad, PG (Corresponding Author), Univ Bergen, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.

"Bronte, Robert and Shahriar, Hossain and Haddad, Hisham M.",A Signature-Based Intrusion Detection System for Web Applications based    on Genetic Algorithm,,2016,,,32-39,,"Web application attacks are an extreme threat to the world's information    technology infrastructure. A web application is generally defined as a    client-server software application where the client uses a user    interface within a web browser. Most users are familiar with web    application attacks. For instance, a user may have received a link in an    email that led the user to a malicious website. The most widely accepted    solution to this threat is to deploy an Intrusion Detection System    (IDS). Such a system currently relies on signatures of the predefined    set of events matching with attacks. Issues still arise as all possible    attack signatures may not be defined before deploying an IDS. Attack    events may not fit with the pre-defined signatures. Thus, there is a    need to detect new types of attacks with a mutated signature based    detection approach. Most traditional literature works describe signature    based IDSs for application layer attacks, but several works mention that    not all attacks can be detected. It is well known that many security    threats can be related to software or application development and design    or implementation flaws. Given that fact, this work expands a new method    for signature based web application layer attack detection. We apply a    genetic algorithm to analyze web server and database logs and the log    entries. The work contributes to the development of a mutated signature    detection framework. The initial results show that the suggested    approach can detect specific application layer attacks such as    Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Injection and Remote File Inclusion attacks.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Bronte, R (Corresponding Author), Kennesaw State Univ, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA.

We conducted recruitment, screening, informed consent,    study product distribution, and data collection remotely. Our objective    is to describe how to conduct a randomized clinical trial using remote    and automated methods. Methods:A randomized clinical trial in healthcare    workers is used as a model. A random group of workers were invited to    participate in the study through email. Following an automated process,    interested individuals scheduled consent/screening interviews. Enrollees    received study product by mail and surveys via email. Adherence to study    product and safety were monitored with survey data review and via    real-time safety alerts to study staff. Results:A staff of 10 remotely    screened 406 subjects and enrolled 299 over a 3-month period. Adherence    to study product was 87\%, and survey data completeness was 98.5\% over    9 months. Participants and study staff scored the System Usability Scale    93.8\% and 90\%, respectively. The automated and remote methods allowed    the study maintenance period to be managed by a small study team of two    members, while safety monitoring was conducted by three to four team    members.

ACM,Interactive Multi-Credential Authentication,,2024,,,408-422,,"Authentication is the first, crucial step in securing digital assets    like cryptocurrencies and online services like banking. It relies on    principals maintaining exclusive access to credentials like    cryptographic signing keys, passwords, and physical devices. But both    individuals and organizations struggle to manage their credentials,    resulting in loss of assets and identity theft.    In this work, we study mechanisms with back-and-forth interaction with    the principals. For example, a user receives an email notification about    sending money from her bank account and is given a period of time to    abort.    We define the authentication problem, where a mechanism interacts with a    user and an attacker. A mechanism's success depends on the    scenario-which credentials each principal knows. The profile of a    mechanism is the set of scenarios in which it succeeds. The subset    relation on profiles defines a partial order on mechanisms. We bound the    profile size and discover three types of novel mechanisms that are    maximally secure.    We show the efficacy of our model by analyzing existing mechanisms and    make concrete improvement proposals: Using ``sticky{''} messages for    security notifications, prioritizing credentials when accessing one's    bank account, and using one of our maximal mechanisms to improve a    popular cryptocurrency wallet.

RingCT provides the user's    identity anonymity based on the linkable ring signature. At the cost of    that, the transaction size is increased linearly to the involved users.    In this article, we aim to overcome this inefficient aspect of RingCT by    introducing the linkable threshold ring signature (LTRS). We first    propose a construction of threshold ring signatures for homomorphic    cryptosystems, and present an efficient instantiation based on the    intractability assumption of the discrete logarithm problem. Based on    this framework, an efficient LTRS scheme and a novel construction of the    RingCT protocol are presented. Our proposed RingCT protocol enables    multiple payers to co-construct an anonymous transaction without    revealing their secret account keys, and it is more concise under    multiple input accounts.

IEEE,Ways to evade spam filters and machine learning as a potential solution,,2006,,,1136+,,"The growth of unsolicited email or junk mail has become a major threat    to information security today. Most of the commercial websites providing    email facility today provide some form of programmable automatic    filtration of junk mails, typically in the form of a set of rules to    dispose of mails based on keywords detected in headers or message body.    There are some other methods for the purpose as well, but an adaptive    email filtering system based on Bayesian technique that can learn from    its user's mail preferences appears to be a better solution. It not only    considers the keywords that identify spam, but also words that denote    innocent or legitimate mail which makes the filter more efficient.    However direct marketers discover new ways to evade even the Bayesian    filters, so as to reach the potential customers. The way most commonly    adopted by the spammers to mislead the Bayesian filters is injection of    out of context text in the email. This paper aims at presenting a    critical analysis of the various ways adopted by spammers to dodge the    spam filters. Further we explore the Bayesian Noise Reduction (BNR)    technique which attempts to solve this problem by identifying and    eliminating the `out of context' data (so injected by spammers or    otherwise) to provide a cleaner classification.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Chandra, V (Corresponding Author), APS Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Rewa, India.

The PD self-assessment app, a digital    application (app), was developed to increase PD awareness, provide men    with a self-screening and educational tool for PD, and help eliminate    barriers to seeking consultation with a physician. Prior to deployment,    4 board-certified urologists provided qualitative reviews on the app's    usability and utility as a screening tool. The PD self-assessment app    features a questionnaire that addresses penile curvature, challenges    with penetration, partner distress, and the impact on sexual    experiences. The app uses the phone's camera lens to perform a live scan    employing a mathematical algorithm to determine the degree of curvature    of an erect penis. Results include a three-dimensional (3D) penile    simulation and a two-dimensional (2D) penile outline, allowing the user    to mark plaque locations and determine the maximum curvature without    requiring personal photographs. The user can choose to email their    answers to the questionnaire and the representative penile simulation    results to their physician. The app also includes external links    directing users to an educational website focused on PD and to help with    finding a treating physician. The app was designed with privacy and    security features including optional password protection, encryption of    sensitive data, in-app storage of all screening results, and the erasing    of all data when the app is uninstalled. Patients will be empowered to    self-assess their PD and locate a PD-experienced physician privately and    securely. The app is not designed for diagnosing, treating, curing, or    preventing any medical conditions, or diseases, nor does it substitute    for a medical consultation. For security, scanning technology, rather    than personal photography, is adjunctive to the diagnosis process. The    app is designed to be flexible and expandable for future updates. It    aims to assist men and their partners in learning about PD, tracking    penile deformity, and enabling communication with a health care provider    (HCP).",AME PUBLISHING COMPANY,"FLAT-RM C 16F, KINGS WING PLAZA 1, NO 3 KWAN ST, SHATIN, HONG KONG    00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",Review,English,"Broderick, GA (Corresponding Author), Mayo Clin, Dept Urol, Davis Bldg 4500 San Pablo Rd S, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA.

"Sharma, Megha and Kumar, Mayank and Gonzalez, Cleotilde and Dutt, Varun",How the Presence of Cognitive Biases in Phishing Emails Affects Human    Decision-Making?,,2023,1792,,550-560,,"The rate of phishing attacks is increasing over time. Although hackers    design emails with cognitive biases for their phishing attacks to    succeed, little is known about how effectively these biases fool people    via phishing emails. Also, little is known how machine learning    algorithms can predict human tendency to get phished via phishing emails    in the presence of human attributes. In this paper, the main objective    is to investigate how the presence of two cognitive biases, authority    bias (the tendency of humans to get influenced by the emails sent by    authority) and hyperbolic discounting bias (the inclination of humans    towards immediate rewards), influence human decision making via a    phishing email detection simulation. In an experiment, 210 participants    judged emails to be genuine or phishing. The next part of this research    predicted the human responses to phishing emails captured in the    experiment via machine learning models such as logistic regression (LR),    multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), decision tree (DT), and Random Forest    (RF). The results from the study conducted on humans revealed that the    authority bias was more effective compared to hyperbolic discounting in    phishing humans. Furthermore, the LR classifier effectively predicted    human responses in the presence of cognitive biases and human attributes    with training and test accuracy of around 90.77\% and 82.70\%,    respectively. We discuss the implications of this work for real-world    phishing attacks.",SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,"152 BEACH ROAD, \#21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",Proceedings Paper,English,"Sharma, M (Corresponding Author), Indian Inst Technol, Appl Cognit Sci Lab, Mandi, Himachal Prades, India.

ASSOC COMP MACHINERY,Examining the Link Between Stress Level and Cybersecurity Practices of    Hospital Staff in Indonesia,,2021,,,,,"Since healthcare information systems have many important data that can    attract many adversaries, it is important to take the right steps to    prevent data breaches. Recent studies suggested that 85\% of breaches    involved a human element and the frequent patterns used are social    engineerings. Therefore, many studies focus on making a better    understanding of human behavior in cybersecurity and the factors that    affect cybersecurity practices. However, there are only a few    peer-reviewed studies that focus on the link between stress level and    cybersecurity practices. In this study, we examined the link between    stress level and cybersecurity practices among hospital employees in    Indonesia by surveying 99 hospital workers. Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)    was used to measure the employees' stress level and a new scale to    measure hospital staff's risky cybersecurity practices was proposed.    This study showed that both PSS and proposed cybersecurity practices    scales are reliable with Cronbach's alpha value of more than 0.7. The    survey results also revealed that hospital worker's higher stress levels    correlate significantly with riskier cybersecurity practices (r(s) =    0.305, p < 0.01). Besides, a higher stress level is also significantly    linked to certain cybersecurity practices, such as clicking on a link in    an email from an unknown sender, not preventing colleagues from viewing    patients' information for a non-therapeutic purpose, posting patient    information on social media, ignoring colleagues who engage in negative    information security practices, and failing to create strong passwords.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Proceedings Paper,English,"Fauzi, MA (Corresponding Author), Norwegian Univ Sci \& Technol, Gjovik, Innlandet, Norway.

IEEE,Feasibility of Large-Scale Vulnerability Notifications after GDPR,,2020,,,532-537,,"In this paper, we consider the problem of effective notifications of    domain abuse or vulnerabilities to the domain owners, administrators, or    webmasters. We have developed a scanner to test whether selected email    aliases specified in RFC 2142 are correctly configured and whether    notifications can be successfully delivered. We also test the    reachability of email addresses collected from the DNS Start of    Authority (SOA) records. Based on a measurement campaign of a large    number of domains compared to the previous studies (4,602,907 domains),    we show that domains are more reachable through SOA contacts. We find    that the country-code TLD names are more reachable compared to the new    gTLD names. We have also observed that the most used generic email alias    is abuse (67.95\%). Using regression analysis, we show the relationship    between the reachability of email addresses and the fact that names are    hosted on large shared platforms or have a significant value.

Cloud based email is one of services    provided by cloud computing with number of users expanding on yearly    basis. Cloud computing faces concerning problem of security and privacy    mainly based on its working environment. Identity authentication is one    reliable method in cloud environment to identify users requesting for    cloud services, currently user authentication in cloud computing is    based on the credentials possessed by the user mostly username \&    password. However, this method has vulnerability of being compromised by    illegitimate users when users' passwords have been revealed or cracked.    The paper proposes a more secure structure, i.e the two-factor    authentication which authenticates by requiring the username/password    pair also needs a second factor to completely grant access. The second    factor is App stored in users' smart devices. Username \& password/Apps    method will continue to allow users to set up passwords for their    accounts, it will make a random compulsory code to be entered through    App on smart phone devices hence keep privacy of cloud emails. Testing    has been done with help of Python program environment.

"DeBarr, Dave and Ramanathan, Venkatesh and Wechsler, Harry","Phishing Detection Using Traffic Behavior, Spectral Clustering, and    Random Forests",,2013,,,67-72,,"Phishing is an attempt to steal a user's identity. This is typically    accomplished by sending an email message to a user, with a link    directing the user to a web site used to collect personal information.    Phishing detection systems typically rely on content filtering    techniques, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify    phishing messages. In the case of spear phishing, however, this may be    ineffective because messages from a trusted source may contain little    content. In order to handle such emerging spear phishing behavior, we    propose as a first step the use of Spectral Clustering to analyze    messages based on traffic behavior. In particular, Spectral Clustering    analyzes the links between URL substrings for web sites found in the    message contents. Cluster membership is then used to construct a Random    Forest classifier for phishing. Data from the Phishing Email Corpus and    the Spam Assassin Email Corpus are used to evaluate this approach.    Performance evaluation metrics include the Area Under the receiver    operating characteristic Curve (AUC), as well as accuracy, precision,    recall, and the (harmonic mean) F measure. Performance of the integrated    Spectral Clustering and Random Forest approach is found to provide    significant improvements in all the metrics listed, compared to a    content filtering technique such as LDA coupled with text message    deletion done randomly or in an adaptive fashion using adversarial    learning. The Spectral Clustering approach is robust against the absence    of content. In particular, we show that Spectral Clustering yields    (99.8\%, 97.8\%) for (AUC, F measure) compared to LDA that yields    (94.6\%, 89.4\%) and (79.6\%, 57.9\%) when the content of the messages    is reduced to 10\% of their original size using random and adversarial    deletion, respectively. The difference is most striking at low False    Positive (FP) rates.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"DeBarr, D (Corresponding Author), George Mason Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.

Assoc Comp Machinery,Cracking App Isolation on Apple: Unauthorized Cross-App Resource Access    on MAC OS X and iOS,,2015,,,31-43,,"On modern operating systems, applications under the same user are    separated from each other, for the purpose of protecting them against    malware and compromised programs. Given the complexity of today's OSes,    less clear is whether such isolation is effective against different kind    of cross-app resource access attacks (called XARA in our research). To    better understand the problem, on the less-studied Apple platforms, we    conducted a systematic security analysis on MAC OS X and iOS. Our    research leads to the discovery of a series of high-impact security    weaknesses, which enable a sandboxed malicious app, approved by the    Apple Stores, to gain unauthorized access to other apps' sensitive data.    More specifically, we found that the inter-app interaction services,    including the keychain, WebSocket and NSConnection on OS X and URL    Scheme on OS X and iOS, can all be exploited by the malware to steal    such confidential information as the passwords for iCloud, email and    bank, and the secret token of Evernote. Further, the design of the App    sandbox on OS X was found to be vulnerable, exposing an app's private    directory to the sandboxed malware that hijacks its Apple Bundle ID. As    a result, sensitive user data, like the notes and user contacts under    Evernote and photos under WeChat, have all been disclosed.    Fundamentally, these problems are caused by the lack of app-to-app and    app-to-OS authentications. To better understand their impacts, we    developed a scanner that automatically analyzes the binaries of OS X and    iOS apps to determine whether proper protection is missing in their    code. Running it on hundreds of binaries, we confirmed the pervasiveness    of the weaknesses among high-impact Apple apps. Since the issues may not    be easily fixed, we built a simple program that detects exploit attempts    on OS X, helping protect vulnerable apps before the problems can be    fully addressed. We further discuss the insights from this study and the    lessons learnt for building a securer system.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Xing, LY (Corresponding Author), Indiana Univ Bloomington, Bloomington, IN USA.

"McCorry, Patrick and Shahandashti, Siamak F. and Clarke, Dylan and Hao,    Feng",Authenticated Key Exchange over Bitcoin,,2015,9497,,3-20,,"Bitcoin is designed to protect user anonymity (or pseudonymity) in a    financial transaction, and has been increasingly adopted by major    e-commerce websites such as Dell, PayPal and Expedia. While the    anonymity of Bitcoin transactions has been extensively studied, little    attention has been paid to the security of post-transaction    correspondence. In a commercial application, the merchant and the user    often need to engage in follow-up correspondence after a Bitcoin    transaction is completed, e.g., to acknowledge the receipt of payment,    to confirm the billing address, to arrange the product delivery, to    discuss refund and so on. Currently, such follow-up correspondence is    typically done in plaintext via email with no guarantee on    confidentiality. Obviously, leakage of sensitive data from the    correspondence (e.g., billing address) can trivially compromise the    anonymity of Bitcoin users. In this paper, we initiate the first study    on how to realise end-to-end secure communication between Bitcoin users    in a post-transaction scenario without requiring any trusted third party    or additional authentication credentials. This is an important new area    that has not been covered by any IEEE or ISO/IEC security standard, as    none of the existing PKI-based or password-based AKE schemes are    suitable for the purpose. Instead, our idea is to leverage the Bitcoin's    append-only ledger as an additional layer of authentication between    previously confirmed transactions. This naturally leads to a new    category of AKE protocols that bootstrap trust entirely from the block    chain. We call this new category ``Bitcoin-based AKE{''} and present two    concrete protocols: one is non-interactive with no forward secrecy,    while the other is interactive with additional guarantee of forward    secrecy.

Throughout the iterations, 19 to 26 \% of the    vendors were unreachable or did not reply at all. Our subject access    requests were fulfilled in 15 to 53 \% of the cases, with an unexpected    decline between the GDPR enforcement date and the end of our study. The    remaining responses exhibit a long list of shortcomings, including    severe violations of information security and data protection    principles. Some responses even contained deceptive and misleading    statements (7 to 13 \%). Further, 9 \% of the apps were discontinued and    27 \% of the user accounts vanished during our study, mostly without    proper notification about the consequences for our personal data.

With an increasing number of    automated software bots and automated scripts that exploit public web    services, the user is commonly required to solve a Turing test problem,    namely a Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and    Humans Apart (CAPTCHA), before they are allowed to use web services. The    purpose of CAPTCHA is to block form submissions from spam bots automated    scripts that harvest email address from publicly available web forms.    Programmers have worked to create special algorithms that can read the    distorted letters from images with the purpose of defeating CAPTCHA    images. Strong CAPTCHA must be used to insure that spam bots will not    pass and submit their information to forms. On the other hands, CAPTCHA    stands for ``completely automated public Turing test to tell computers    and humans apart.Watermarking and fingerprinting are part of the    STEGANOGRAPHY.{''} A watermark is an image which appears on fine papers    or on some documents to prevent counterfeiting. The watermark is    designed to appear only when the paper is held at a particular angle, or    against a black background. Standard paper usually does not include a    watermark, as making a watermark will drive the cost of the paper up.    Fine art papers use watermarks to identify the manufacturer, and    companies such as banks frequently use specially watermarked paper for    security. In this proposed topic we want to watermark an encryption    information in the arbitrary image, then distort this image (by changing    the location of components of image) and send it to the desired    receiver. In the destination, receiver gets the image and he/she must    detect the correct image and after that he/she can access to its    information that is embedded on it.

To infer user intent, BINDER correlates outbound connections with    user-driven input at the process level under the assumption that user    intent is implied by user-driven input. Thus BINDER can detect a large    class of unknown malware such as worms, spyware and adware without    requiring signatures.

"Kaplan, Berkay and Qian, Jingyu",A Survey on Common Threats in npm and PyPi Registries,,2021,1482,,132-156,,"Software engineers regularly use JavaScript and Python for both    front-end and back-end automation tasks. On top of JavaScript and    Python, there are several frameworks to facilitate automation tasks    further. Some of these frameworks are Node Manager Package (npm) and    Python Package Index (PyPi), which are open source (OS) package    libraries. The public registries npm and PyPi use to host packages allow    any user with a verified email to publish code. The lack of a    comprehensive scanning tool when publishing to the registry creates    security concerns. Users can report malicious code on the registry;    however, attackers can still cause damage until they remove their tool    from the platform. Furthermore, several packages depend on each other,    making them more vulnerable to a bad package in the dependency tree. The    heavy code reuse creates security artifacts developers have to consider,    such as the package reach. This project will illustrate a high-level    overview of common risks associated with OS registries and the package    dependency structure. There are several attack types, such as    typosquatting and combosquatting, in the OS package registries. Outdated    packages pose a security risk, and we will examine the extent of    technical lag present in the npm environment. In this paper, our main    contribution consists of a survey of common threats in OS registries.    Afterward, we will offer countermeasures to mitigate the risks    presented. These remedies will heavily focus on the applications of    Machine Learning (ML) to detect suspicious activities. To the best of    our knowledge, the ML-focused countermeasures are the first proposed    possible solutions to the security problems listed.

The aerial IRS can adjust its    trajectory and phase-shift to track the moving user and provide safer    communication services. Furthermore, due to the mobility of the UAV,    user and eavesdropper, the effect of Doppler shifts is also taken into    consideration in the channel model. Under such a setup, we formulate an    average secrecy rate maximization problem to jointly optimize the 3D    trajectory of the UAV and the phase-shift matrix of the aerial IRS. To    deal with this non-convex optimization problem, we decompose the    original problem into two subproblems and propose an iterative algorithm    to determine its suboptimal solution.

To address these issues, we propose UPAM, a    novel framework to evaluate the robustness of T2I models from an attack    perspective. Unlike prior methods that focus solely on textual defenses,    UPAM unifies the attack on both textual and visual defenses.    Additionally, it enables gradient-based optimization, overcoming    reliance on enumeration for improved efficiency and effectiveness. To    handle cases where T2I models block image outputs due to defenses, we    introduce Sphere-Probing Learning (SPL) to enable optimization even    without image results. Following SPL, our model bypasses defenses,    inducing the generation of harmful content. To ensure semantic alignment    with attacker intent, we propose Semantic-Enhancing Learning (SEL) for    precise semantic control. UPAM also prioritizes the naturalness of    adversarial prompts using In-context Naturalness Enhancement (INE),    making them harder for human examiners to detect. Additionally, we    address the issue of iterative queries-common in prior methods and    easily detectable by API defenders-by introducing Transferable Attack    Learning (TAL), allowing effective attacks with minimal queries.    Extensive experiments validate UPAM's superiority in effectiveness,    efficiency, naturalness, and low query detection rates.",IEEE COMPUTER SOC,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",Article,English,"Liu, J (Corresponding Author), Univ Lancaster, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England.

As part of our    study, we also develop methods for classifying email complaints and an    interactive crawler to find subtle forms of discrimination, and deploy    our own exits in various configurations to understand which are prone to    discrimination. We find that conservative exit policies are ineffective    in preventing the blacklisting of exit relays. However, a majority of    the attacks originating from Tor generate high traffic volume,    suggesting the possibility of detection and prevention without violating    Tor users' privacy.",USENIX ASSOC,"SUITE 215, 2560 NINTH ST, BERKELEY, CA 94710 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Singh, R (Corresponding Author), Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.

The more technology    advances, the more sophisticated phishing attacks become. As more people    rely on technology to conduct their online businesses, the need for    secure Mobile Intelligent Agents (MIAs) systems becomes higher. MIAs are    software that execute functions or duties such as managing electronic    mail, gathering, and sending out information on behalf of an online    user. MIAs play a vital role in carrying out electronic commerce    activities whether from business-to-customer, customer-to-customer, or    business-to-business. In this paper, we use Decision Tree (DT) to    accurately predict the status of a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and    flag those predicted to be phishing. The DT algorithm extract URL    features such as the domain name, URL length, host name, page ranking,    etc., and feeds them into the model which then makes status prediction.    The extracted features are then filtered into the model to improve its    future predictions. The proposed model has a prediction accuracy of    91.3\% and it is also cost effective as well as easy to use. The other    benefit of the proposed solution is its capability to flag phishing URL    and prevent a user from launching the web browser thereby protecting    their personal information from being stolen by criminals.",SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",Proceedings Paper,English,"Kogeda, OP (Corresponding Author), Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Math Stat \& Comp Sci, Westville Campus, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa.

"Guo, Fuchun and Mu, Yi and Chen, Zhide",Identity-based encryption: How to decrypt multiple ciphertexts using a    single decryption key,,2007,4575,,392-406,,"The beauty of identity-based encryption (IBE) lies in the convenience of    public key handling, in the sense that any identification such as an    email address, a name, or an IP number can serve as a public key of a    party. However, such convenience is not inherited by a system where a    party possesses many identities (e.g., many email addresses) and has to    use them as his public keys. When this system is handled with a standard    IBE, the user must manage all the private keys that are associated with    all the public keys (identities). However, keeping these private keys is    inconvenient to the user. In this paper, we solve this problem by    proposing a novel identity-based encryption where we set a private key    that maps multiple public keys (identities); namely, we can use a    private key to decrypt multiple ciphertexts; each was encrypted with a    different public key (identity).",SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",Proceedings Paper,English,"Guo, FC (Corresponding Author), Fujian Normal Univ, Key Lab Network Secur \& Cryptol, Sch Math \& Comp Sci, Fuzhou, Peoples R China.

USENIX Assoc,ALPACA: Application Layer Protocol Confusion - Analyzing and Mitigating    Cracks in TLS Authentication,,2021,,BS4QP,4293-4310,,"TLS is widely used to add confidentiality, authenticity and integrity to    application layer protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP3, and FTP.    However, TLS does not bind a TCP connection to the intended application    layer protocol. This allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to redirect TLS    traffic to a different TLS service endpoint on another IP address and/or    port. For example, if subdomains share a wildcard certificate, an    attacker can redirect traffic from one subdomain to another, resulting    in a valid TLS session. This breaks the authentication of TLS and    cross-protocol attacks may be possible where the behavior of one service    may compromise the security of the other at the application layer.    In this paper, we investigate cross-protocol attacks on TLS in general    and conduct a systematic case study on web servers, redirecting HTTPS    requests from a victim's web browser to SMTP, IMAP, POP3, and FTP    servers. We show that in realistic scenarios, the attacker can extract    session cookies and other private user data or execute arbitrary    JavaScript in the context of the vulnerable web server, therefore    bypassing TLS and web application security.    We evaluate the real-world attack surface of web browsers and    widely-deployed email and FTP servers in lab experiments and with    internet-wide scans. We find that 1.4M web servers are generally    vulnerable to cross-protocol attacks, i.e., TLS application data    confusion is possible. Of these, 114k web servers can be attacked using    an exploitable application server. Finally, we discuss the effectiveness    of TLS extensions such as Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)    and Server Name Indiciation (SNI) in mitigating these and other    cross-protocol attacks.",USENIX ASSOC,"SUITE 215, 2560 NINTH ST, BERKELEY, CA 94710 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Brinkmann, M (Corresponding Author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Bochum, Germany.

An ICT can be thought of as a JSON-based, short-lived    user certificate for end-to-end user authentication without the need for    cumbersome key management. A user can request an ICT from his OpenID    Provider (OP) and use it to prove his identity to other users that trust    the OP.

Unlike certificates, OIDC2 does not require    installation and can be easily used on multiple devices, making it more    user-friendly. We outline protocols for implementing OIDC2 based on    existing standards. We discuss the trust relationship between entities    involved in OIDC2, propose a classification of OPs' trust level, and    propose authentication with multiple ICTs from different OPs.

However, these    instructions, encompassing images and text, are susceptible to both    intentional and inadvertent attacks. Despite the critical importance of    LVLMs' robustness against such threats, current research in this area    remains limited. To bridge this gap, we introduce B-AVIBench, a    framework designed to analyze the robustness of LVLMs when facing    various Black-box Adversarial Visual-Instructions (B-AVIs), including    four types of image-based B-AVIs, ten types of text-based B-AVIs, and    nine types of content bias B-AVIs (such as gender, violence, cultural,    and racial biases, among others). We generate 316K B-AVIs encompassing    five categories of multimodal capabilities (ten tasks) and content bias.    We then conduct a comprehensive evaluation involving 14 open-source    LVLMs to assess their performance. B-AVIBench also serves as a    convenient tool for practitioners to evaluate the robustness of LVLMs    against B-AVIs. Our findings and extensive experimental results shed    light on the vulnerabilities of LVLMs, and highlight that inherent    biases exist even in advanced closed-source LVLMs like GeminiProVision    and GPT-4V.

IEEE,Leaky Kits: The Increased Risk of Data Exposure from    Phishing Kits,,2022,,,,,"Phishing kits allow adversaries with little or no technical experience    to launch phishing websites in a short time. Past research has found    such phishing kits that contain backdoors (e.g., obfuscated email    addresses), which are intentionally added by the kit developers to    obtain the phished data. In this work, we augment on prior research by    exploring several ways in which security flaws in phishing kits make the    victim data accessible to a wider set of adversaries beyond the kit    deployers and kit developers. We implement an automated framework for    kit collection and analysis, which includes a custom command-line PHP    execution tool (for dynamic analysis) along with other open-source    tools. Our analysis focuses on finding backdoors (e.g., obfuscated email    address, command injection), measuring the extent of disclosure of    sensitive information (e.g., via exposed plaintext files, hardcoded    Telegram bot tokens, hardcoded admin console passwords) and detecting    security vulnerabilities in phishing kits. We analyze 4238 distinct    phishing kits (from a set of 26,281 compressed files collected from    several sources over a span of 15 months), each having unique SHA-1 hash    value.

We also found hardcoded admin console passwords and    API keys used to access third party services, in 8.3\% and 16\% of the    analyzed kits, respectively. In addition, 15.8\% of the analyzed kits    wrote stolen information (PII) of users in plaintext files; 5.6\% kits    did not restrict external access to these plaintext files, leading to    exposure of sensitive phished data (e.g., 178,504 passwords, 133,248    email addresses, 1253 credit card numbers). Furthermore, 11.7\% of the    analyzed kits contained hardcoded Telegram bots; we obtained invite    links to join Telegram chats in 0.5\% kits, and found them to expose    chat messages containing sensitive PII information of victims (e.g.,    73,342 passwords, 141,095 email addresses, 3584 credit card numbers). We    also found that 64\% of the kits are affected by security    vulnerabilities (e.g., insecure file operations, SQL injection), which    can be abused to further expose user data.

Already after a short time    organisations and individuals have become so dependent upon proper    functioning of highly complex and hardly understandable ICT-systems that    any deviation from ``normal{''} behaviour may have adversary, if not    damaging effects. Contemporary technologies are in many cases designed    and implemented without adequate provisions for safe and secure    functioning. These systems can easily be attacked, even by experimenting    boys at the age of puberty. e.g. by injecting viruses and worms into The    Internet, which then rapidly propagates these malicious gifts (in some    cases even in epidemic amounts of up to 100 million emailed worms per 24    hours) into enterprises, offices, schools and everybody's PC. Internet    communication protocols are weakly designed, and it is easy to    ``spoof{''} ones email address, to ``sniff{''} and to intercept    messages, such as transfer of electronic funds. To protect these already    overly complex systems, the usual solution is to add more complexity:    firewalls, antivirus software and encryption. Two types of reaction to    ICT related vulnerabilities can be observed. Some users have a ``don't    care{''} strategy, especially young people who leave a data trail of    personal behaviour when surfing websites with potentially interesting    economic or sociological content. Other users wish to exclude all risks    and follow a strategy of ``don't use{''}. Both reactions are undesirable    in the Information Society.

However, a cloud storage provider    (CSP) may tamper user data or cheat users to pay unused storage for    duplicate data that are only stored once. Although previous solutions    adopt message-locked encryption along with Proof of Retrievability (PoR)    to check the integrity of deduplicated encrypted data, they ignore    proving the correctness of duplication check during data upload and    require the same file to be derived into same verification tags, which    suffers from brute-force attacks and restricts users from flexibly    creating their own individual verification tags. In this paper, we    propose a verifiable deduplication scheme called VeriDedup to address    the above problems. It can guarantee the correctness of duplication    check and support flexible tag generation for integrity check over    encrypted data deduplication in an integrative way. Concretely, we    propose a novel Tag-flexible Deduplication-supported Integrity Check    Protocol (TDICP) based on Private Information Retrieval (PIR) by    introducing a novel verification tag called note set, which allows    multiple users holding the same file to generate their individual    verification tags and still supports tag deduplication at the CSP.    Furthermore, we make the first attempt to guarantee the correctness of    data duplication check by introducing a novel User Determined    Duplication Check Protocol (UDDCP) based on Private Set Intersection    (PSI), which can resist a CSP from providing a fake duplication check    result to users. Security analysis shows the correctness and soundness    of our scheme.

On the other hand, new cryptographic primitives allow this    classification task to be performed on encrypted emails without    revealing the email contents, hence preserves user data privacy. In this    paper, we construct a spam classification framework that enables the    classification of encrypted emails. Our model is based on a neural    network with a quadratic network component and a multi-layer perceptron    network component. The quadratic network architecture is compatible with    the operation of an existing quadratic functional encryption scheme. To    protect email content privacy, we proposed two spam classification    solutions based on homomorphic encryption (HE) and functional encryption    (FE) that enables our classifiers to predict the label of encrypted    emails. The evaluation results on real-world spam datasets indicate that    our proposed spam classification solutions achieve accuracies over 95\%.    Our performance study and security analysis provide pros and cons of    each proposed solution.

This study aims to highlight    strengths and provide recommendations to improve adoption of future    contact tracing developments. Design A 60-item, anonymous online    questionnaire, disseminated through social media outlets and email lists    by a team from Imperial College London. Setting England. Participants    Convenience sample of 1036 responses, from participants aged 18 years    and above, between December 2020 and January 2021. Primary outcome    measures Evaluate the compliance and public attitude towards the `NHS    COVID-19' app regarding its functionality and features. This included    whether participants' expectations were met, and their thoughts on the    app privacy and security. Furthermore, to distinguish how usability,    perception, and adoption differed with varying demographics and user    values. Results Fair compliance with the app features was identified,    meeting expectations of the 62.1\% of participants who stated they    downloaded it after weighted analysis. However, participants finding the    interface challenging were less likely to read information in the app    and had a lesser understanding of its functionality. Furthermore, little    understanding regarding the app's functionality and privacy concerns was    a possible reason why users did not download it. A readability analysis    of the text revealed information within the app was conveyed at a level    that may be too complex for up to 43\% of the UK population. The study    highlighted issues related to the potential of false positives caused by    the design choices in the `Check-In' feature. Conclusion This study    showed that while the `NHS COVID-19' app was viewed positively, there    remained issues regarding participants' perceived knowledge of app    functionality, potentially affecting compliance. Therefore, we    recommended improvements regarding the delivery and presentation of the    app's information, and highlighted the potential need for the ability to    check out of venues to reduce the number of false positive contacts.",BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP,"BRITISH MED ASSOC HOUSE, TAVISTOCK SQUARE, LONDON WC1H 9JR, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Singh, S (Corresponding Author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Elect \& Elect Engn, London, England.

IEEE,The Cracked Cookie Jar: HTTP Cookie Hijacking and the Exposure of    Private Information,,2016,,,724-742,,"The widespread demand for online privacy, also fueled by    widely-publicized demonstrations of session hijacking attacks against    popular websites, has spearheaded the increasing deployment of HTTPS.    However, many websites still avoid ubiquitous encryption due to    performance or compatibility issues. The prevailing approach in these    cases is to force critical functionality and sensitive data access over    encrypted connections, while allowing more innocuous functionality to be    accessed over HTTP. In practice, this approach is prone to flaws that    can expose sensitive information or functionality to third parties.    In this paper, we conduct an in-depth assessment of a diverse set of    major websites and explore what functionality and information is exposed    to attackers that have hijacked a user's HTTP cookies. We identify a    recurring pattern across websites with partially deployed HTTPS; service    personalization inadvertently results in the exposure of private    information. The separation of functionality across multiple cookies    with different scopes and inter-dependencies further complicates    matters, as imprecise access control renders restricted account    functionality accessible to non-session cookies. Our cookie hijacking    study reveals a number of severe flaws; attackers can obtain the user's    home and work address and visited websites from Google, Bing and Baidu    expose the user's complete search history, and Yahoo allows attackers to    extract the contact list and send emails from the user's account.    Furthermore, e-commerce vendors such as Amazon and Ebay expose the    user's purchase history (partial and full respectively), and almost    every website exposes the user's name and email address. Ad networks    like Doubleclick can also reveal pages the user has visited. To fully    evaluate the practicality and extent of cookie hijacking, we explore    multiple aspects of the online ecosystem, including mobile apps, browser    security mechanisms, extensions and search bars. To estimate the extent    of the threat, we run IRB-approved measurements on a subset of our    university's public wireless network for 30 days, and detect over 282K    accounts exposing the cookies required for our hijacking attacks. We    also explore how users can protect themselves and find that, while    mechanisms such as the EFF's HTTPS Everywhere extension can reduce the    attack surface, HTTP cookies are still regularly exposed. The privacy    implications of these attacks become even more alarming when considering    how they can be used to deanonymize Tor users. Our measurements suggest    that a significant portion of Tor users may currently be vulnerable to    cookie hijacking.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Sivakorn, S (Corresponding Author), Columbia Univ, Dept Comp Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA.

"Canham, Matthew",Repeat Clicking: A Lack of Awareness is Not the Problem,,2023,14059,,325-342,,"Although phishing is the most common social engineering tactic employed    by cyber criminals, not everyone is equally susceptible. An important    finding emerging across several research studies on phishing is that a    subset of employees is especially susceptible to social engineering    tactics and is responsible for a disproportionate number of successful    phishing attempts. Sometimes referred to as repeat clickers, these    employees habitually fail simulated phishing tests and are suspected of    being responsible for a significant number of real-world phishing    related data breaches. In contrast to repeat clickers, protective    stewards are those employees who never fail simulated phishing exercises    and habitually report phishing simulations to their security    departments. This study explored some of the potential causes of these    persistent behaviors (both good and bad) by administering six    semi-structured interviews (three repeat clickers and three protective    stewards). Surprisingly, both groups were able to identify message cues    for identifying potentially malicious emails. Repeat clickers reported a    more internally oriented locus of control and higher confidence in their    ability to identify phishing emails, but also described more rigid email    checking habits than did protective stewards. One unexpected finding was    that repeat clickers failed to recall an identifier which they were    explicitly informed that they would need to later recall, while the    protective stewards recalled the identifier without error. Due to the    small sample and exploratory nature of this study additional research    should seek to confirm whether these findings extrapolate to larger    populations.",SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",Proceedings Paper,English,"Canham, M (Corresponding Author), Beyond Layer Seven LLC, Oviedo, FL 32765 USA.

IEEE,Attributing Users Based On Web Browser History,,2017,,,69-74,,"Investigating network and computer related crime requires the    combination of heterogeneous sources of reliable evidential weight.    Information such as name, surname, email address, login details, social    network account and banking details may provide insight on the identity    of the device, however, it does not guarantee the identity of the entity    using the device. Several sources of potential evidence have been    adapted for digital investigation processes. As a probable complementary    source of evidence, this study proposed the integration of the semantic    properties of web-browser history into digital forensics. To achieve    this aim, the study developed a web-browser analysis tool which is    independent of the type of browser. Experimental process was carried    using nine users. Cosine and Jaccard similarity functions and motifs    similarity measures were used to explore the probability of attributing    a user based on web-browser history data. The result substantiates the    theoretical assertion of the reliability of the semantic characteristics    of web-browser information. Using the developed tool and the semantic    properties of web-browser data, a forensic investigator can complement    the evidential weight of potential digital evidence used in a forensic    investigation.

Most pieces of technology make use of some    variation of asynchronous communication systems, be it messaging or    email applications. This allows recipients to process digital messages    immediately (synchronous) or whenever they have time (asynchronous),    meaning that purely digital interruptions can be mitigated easily. Mixed    Reality systems have the potential to not only handle digital    interruptions but also interruptions in physical space, e.g., caused by    co-workers in workspaces or learning environments. However, the benefits    of such systems previously remained untested in the context of Mixed    Reality. We conducted a user study (N=26) to investigate the impact that    the timing of task delivery has on the participants' performance,    workflow, and emotional state. Participants had to perform several    cognitively demanding tasks in a Mixed Reality workspace. Inside the    virtual workspace, we simulated in-person task delivery either during    tasks (i.e., interrupting the participant) or between tasks (i.e.,    delaying the interruption).

IEEE,Hiding Based Message Communication techniques depends on Divide and    Conquer Approach,,2017,,,123-128,,"Now a day's Internet has evolved in such a way that we cannot even think    our life without internet. The most popular usages over internet is    messaging. Messaging can be in different form like simple text messaging    or email conversation. But it is always questionable that, whatever we    are sending over internet it is secured or not? And if it is not    secured, how can our message be more secured? Answer is our message can    be encrypted before sending to other user to minimize the chances of    getting leaked in between. If we can encode the message in such a form    that nobody will not understand except receiver then message will be    secured in public medium too. Therefore to safeguard the information    from attacks, number of data/information hiding methods have evolved    various techniques can be used to in sending messages in a secure    manner.

USENIX Assoc,Man vs. Machine: Practical Adversarial Detection of Malicious    Crowdsourcing Workers,,2014,,,239-254,,"Recent work in security and systems has embraced the use of machine    learning (ML) techniques for identifying misbehavior, e.g. email spam    and fake (Sybil) users in social networks. However, ML models are    typically derived from fixed datasets, and must be periodically    retrained. In adversarial environments, attackers can adapt by modifying    their behavior or even sabotaging ML models by polluting training data.    In this paper1, we perform an empirical study of adversarial attacks    against machine learning models in the context of detecting malicious    crowdsourcing systems, where sites connect paying users with workers    willing to carry out malicious campaigns. By using human workers, these    systems can easily circumvent deployed security mechanisms, e.g.    CAPTCHAs. We collect a dataset of malicious workers actively performing    tasks on Weibo, China's Twitter, and use it to develop ML-based    detectors. We show that traditional ML techniques are accurate    (95\%-99\%) in detection but can be highly vulnerable to adversarial    attacks, including simple evasion attacks (workers modify their    behavior) and powerful poisoning attacks (where administrators tamper    with the training set). We quantify the robustness of ML classifiers by    evaluating them in a range of practical adversarial models using ground    truth data. Our analysis provides a detailed look at practical    adversarial attacks on ML models, and helps defenders make informed    decisions in the design and configuration of ML detectors.",USENIX ASSOC,"SUITE 215, 2560 NINTH ST, BERKELEY, CA 94710 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Wang, G (Corresponding Author), UC Santa Barbara, Comp Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.

Pragmatic trials elucidate both benefits and    harms of an intervention under conditions close to daily clinical    practice. We have planned a pragmatic multi-centre trial in patients    with Graves' hyperthyroidism. However, trial management is a complicated    task in pragmatic trials, due to limited interaction between    participants and trial personnel.    Purpose The aim of this project was to develop and implement PROgmatic,    a fully integrated trial management system for pragmatic multi-centre    trials, optimised for electronic data capture and patient-reported    outcomes (PROs).    Methods Necessary tasks and logistical challenges that should be handled    by PROgmatic were identified, and the system was designed and developed    to handle these tasks. A combination of generic applications and custom    coding was applied to develop an integrated system that met the required    needs. PROgmatic features include secure web-based data entry;    electronic case report forms (eCRFs); central participant registration    and randomisation; automated emails linking to electronic PROs;    automated reminders to participants; automated notifications to trial    personnel regarding booking of trial visits, safety and compliance    alerts; and monitoring of trial progress. PROgmatic underwent rigorous    pilot testing, including data verification and validation, before it was    released for trial management.    Results PROgmatic was successfully implemented in the GRAves' Selenium    Supplementation (GRASS) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01611896) December    2012. The feedback from trial personnel on usability and utility has    been positive, and PROgmatic has handled all intended tasks properly.    Limitations Implementation of PROgmatic in future studies requires    adaptation of the custom coding. Not all email systems accept emails    with active links, and participants who use these systems therefore need    to complete paper surveys.    Conclusions PROgmatic facilitated the complex task of conducting a    pragmatic multi-centre trial. The automated electronic capture of PRO    data is time saving and reduces the risk of erroneous data entry. Email    notifications to trial personnel combined with serially activated eCRFs    that logically lead patient flow through the trial have helped making    the pragmatic trial feasible. PROgmatic provides a template for other    pragmatic multi-centre trials with patient-reported measures as    high-priority outcomes.",SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Cramon, P (Corresponding Author), Copenhagen Univ Hosp, Rigshosp, Dept Med Endocrinol, Sect 2131, Blegdamsvej 9, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.

"Qin, Baodong and Deng, Robert H. and Li, Yingjiu and Liu, Shengli",Server-Aided Revocable Identity-Based Encryption,,2015,9326,,286-304,,"Efficient user revocation in Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) has been a    challenging problem and has been the subject of several research efforts    in the literature. Among them, the tree-based revocation approach, due    to Boldyreva, Goyal and Kumar, is probably the most efficient one. In    this approach, a trusted Key Generation Center (KGC) periodically    broadcasts a set of key updates to all (non-revoked) users through    public channels, where the size of key updates is only O(r log N/r),    with N being the number of users and r the number of revoked users,    respectively; however, every user needs to keep at least O(logN)    long-term secret keys and all non-revoked users are required to    communicate with the KGC regularly. These two drawbacks pose challenges    to users who have limited resources to store their secret keys or cannot    receive key updates in real-time.    To alleviate the above problems, we propose a novel system model called    server-aided revocable IBE. In our model, almost all of the workloads on    users are delegated to an untrusted server which manages users' public    keys and key updates sent by a KGC periodically. The server is untrusted    in the sense that it does not possess any secret information. Our system    model requires each user to keep just one short secret key and does not    require users to communicate with either the KGC or the server during    key updating. In addition, the system supports delegation of users'    decryption keys, namely it is secure against decryption key exposure    attacks. We present a concrete construction of the system that is    provably secure against adaptive-ID chosen plaintext attacks under the    DBDH assumption in the standard model. One application of our    server-aided revocable IBE is encrypted email supporting lightweight    devices (e.g., mobile phones) in which an email server plays the role of    the untrusted server so that only non-revoked users can read their email    messages.",SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",Proceedings Paper,English,"Deng, RH (Corresponding Author), Singapore Management Univ, Sch Informat Syst, Singapore 178902, Singapore.

This principle has been proven generally accurate and is    routinely used for long term planning by the computer industry, which    has led to an explosion in computing power and technologies that have    catapulted computing into every aspect of human's lives in the 21st    century. However, while new technologies increase the quality of life    for the current generation, they also provide avenues for nefarious    individuals to take advantage of others using the same new technologies.    To help counter this, the IT industry has made great strides in its    efforts to protect users by developing security appliances to include    firewalls, intrusion detection systems, encryption, passwords,    two-factor authentication methods, and a layered approach to security;    to name just a few. It is because of this effort by the IT industry to    help protect users, the authors have identified unique cyber attack    trends, that could be referred to as a new ``Moore's Law{''} (as it    pertains to cyber security). As computer technologies become more    sophisticated and robust, malicious actions have become less    sophisticated, and in many instances, cyber exploitation and attacks    occur without the use of technology. The authors have penned this    concept as the ``Adam \& Eve Paradox{''}. The paradox construct being,    as technologies improve and network perimeters are hardened preventing    direct attacks against systems, users and systems are being exploited at    an exponentially increased rate by methods contrary to the technological    improvements. Cyber criminals and hackers will always first attempt    attacks against the easiest targets, known as the low-hanging forbidden    fruit described in the biblical Adam \& Eve story. While the IT industry    continues to spend billions of dollars (US) annually to create    appliances and develop software to protect its resources, data, and    users; attackers are increasingly focusing their attention on the lowest    hanging fruit, whether it be an unsuspecting user who clicks a link in    an email, to a helpful administrator who provides information to a false    authority. As the IT industry moves in the direction of complex    defensive tactics, attackers are moving towards less complex - softer    targets that are more difficult to detect, block, and mitigate. It is    the authors' intention to define and substantiate the ``Adam \& Eve    Paradox{''}.",ACAD  CONFERENCES LTD,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",Proceedings Paper,English,"Kraft, M (Corresponding Author), Comp Sci Corp Inc, San Antonio, TX USA.

ACM,POSTER: CUD: Crowdsourcing for URL Spam Detection,,2011,,,785-787,,"The prevalence of spam URLs in Internet services, such as email, social    networks, blogs and online forums has become a serious problem. These    spam URLs host spam advertisements, phishing attempts, and malwares,    which are harmful for normal users. Existing URL blacklist approaches    offer limited protection. Although recent machine learning based URL    classification approaches demonstrate good accuracy and reasonable    throughput, they are based on observations from existing spam URLs and    hard to detect new spam URLs when attackers employ new strategies.    In this paper, we present CUD (Crowdsourcing for URL spam detection) as    a supplement of existing detection tools. CUD leverages human    intelligence for URL classification through crowdsourcing. CUD crawls    existing user comments about spam URLs already on the Internet, and    employs sentiment analysis from nature language processing to analyze    the user comments automatically for detecting spam URLs. Since CUD does    not using features directly associated with the URLs and their landing    pages, it is more robust when attackers change their strategies. Through    evaluation, we find up to 70\% of URLs have user comments online. CUD    achieves an accuracy of 86.8\% in terms of true positive rate with a    false positive rate 0.9\%. Moreover, about 75\% of spam URLs CUD detects    are missed by other approaches.

"Li, Wenjuan and Tan, Jiao and Zhu, Nan",Design of double-cross-based smartphone unlock mechanism,COMPUTERS \& SECURITY,2023,129,103204,,JUN,"Due to the advanced features, smartphones have become an essential and    widely adopted electronic device around the world, which can provide    various benefits, such as online shopping, e-commerce payment, making    friends via social media, email checking and more. Such devices make    people's work and life more convenient and flexible, but how to secure    the locally stored phone data is a big problem. With more sensitive or    private data stored on these portable devices, there is a significant    demand to safeguard smartphones from unauthorized access. Currently, one    of the most straightforward and intuitive approaches is to implement an    unlock mechanism that asks users to input a correct unlock pattern for    authentication, e.g., Android unlock patterns. However, such unlock    mechanism can be easily compromised when the unlock pattern is leaked.    In this work, we advocate that combining behavioral features with unlock    mechanisms is a promising solution, and propose a double-cross-based    unlock scheme, called Double-X, which requires users to unlock the    device by inputting two cross shapes on the selected dots. For    authentication, users have to re-input the selected dots and draw the    cross shapes. In the evaluation, we conduct two user studies with 100    participants in total to explore and validate the scheme performance, as    compared with two similar unlock schemes. The experimental results    indicate that under our scheme, users can reach good success rates with    better feedback.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Social    influence theories have shown that social factors, such as social    pressure and coworker risk-taking, may predict risk-taking behaviors and    significantly affect decision-making. While immersive technologies have    been widely used to create close-to-real simulations for construction    safety-related studies, there is a paucity of research considering the    impact of social presence in evaluating workers' risk decision-making    within immersive environments. To bridge this gap, this study developed    a state-of-the-art Augmented Virtuality (AV) environment to investigate    roofers' risk-taking behaviors when exposed to social stressors (working    alongside a safe/unsafe peer). In this augmented virtuality environment,    a virtual peer with safe and unsafe behaviors was simulated in order to    impose peer pressure and increase participants' sense of social    presence. Participants were asked to install asphalt shingles on a    physical section of a roof (passive haptics) while the rest of the    environment was projected virtually. During shingle installation,    participants' cognitive and behavioral responses were captured using    psychophysiological wearable technologies and self-report measures. The    results demonstrated that the developed AV model could successfully    enhance participants' sense of presence and social presence while    serving as an appropriate platform for assessing individuals'    decision-making orientations and behavioral changes in the presence of    social stressors. Such information shows the value of immersive    technologies to examine the naturalistic responses of individuals    without exposing them to actual risks.",IEEE COMPUTER SOC,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1314 USA",Article,English,"Pooladvand, S (Corresponding Author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Sustainable Engn \& Built Environm, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.

Even    though reinforcement learning (RL) is capable of optimizing energy    efficiency in intricate environments, it is challenged by safety    requirements during both the training and deployment stages. The lack of    safety guarantees impedes the application of RL to real-world problems.    Compared with RL, model predicted control (MPC) can handle constrained    dynamics systems, ensuring safe driving. However, the major challenges    lie in complicated eco-driving tasks and the presence of disturbances,    which pose difficulties for MPC design and constraint satisfaction. To    address these limitations, the proposed framework incorporates the    tube-based enhanced MPC (RMPC) to ensure the safe execution of the RL    policy under disturbances, thereby improving the control robustness. RL    not only optimizes the energy efficiency of the connected and automated    vehicle in mixed traffic but also handles more uncertain scenarios, in    which the energy consumption of the human-driven vehicle and its diverse    and stochastic driving behaviors are considered in the optimization    framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm    achieves an average improvement of 10.88\% in holistic energy efficiency    compared to the RMPC technique, while effectively preventing    inter-vehicle collisions when compared to the RL algorithm.",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Article,English,"Song, ZY (Corresponding Author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Mech Engn, Singapore 117575, Singapore.

Most    enterprises utilizing cloud storage technology consist of multiple user    groups. However, the current multigroup CP-ABE scheme may pose a risk of    sensitive information leakage due to the plaintext access policy    mechanisms. To mitigate this issue, it is necessary to conceal access    policies. In this article, we propose a flexible policy-hidden    multigroup attribute-based encryption (PH-MG-ABE) scheme that enables    unique multigroup operations, such as group merging and splitting    without affecting user keys. Each attribute in the access policy is    divided into attribute values and attribute names. The proposed scheme    achieves partial policy hiding by concealing the attribute values. Our    scheme allows to directly revoke and join arbitrary numbers of users. In    order to reduce the local decryption burden for users, the heavy    decryption tasks are outsourced to cloud servers and correctness of the    outsourced decryption is verifiable. We prove that our scheme is    indistinguishable against under chosen plaintext attacks secure    (IND-CPA) based on the decisional q-bilinear Diffie-Hellman exponent    assumption.

"Balki, Eric and Holland, Carol and Hayes, Niall",Use and Acceptance of Digital Communication Technology by Older Adults    for Social Connectedness During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Mixed Methods    Study,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,2023,25,e41535,,AUG 2,"Background: Older adults are at higher risk for health issues, including    mental health problems. This was especially apparent during the COVID-19    pandemic, where older adults were simultaneously more vulnerable to the    disease and the mental health concerns created by social distancing.    Subsequently, the use of digital communication technology (DCT) became a    critical option for maintaining social connectedness in older adults.    Prior to the pandemic, the low uptake and use of technology by older    adults was an established problem, known as the digital divide. However,    not much is known about how this may have changed as a result of the    pandemic.    Objective: This study aims to explore how older adults maintained social    connectedness through DCT during the pandemic and to understand factors    influencing the use and acceptance of DCT.    Methods: A mixed methods explorative field study was set up, involving    surveys and interviews of 25 community-dwelling older adults (65-88    years old) living in the United Kingdom. The surveys included the    internet acceptance questionnaire (based on the Technology Acceptance    Model {[}TAM]); COVID-19 dysfunctional anxiety was captured using the    COVID-19 Anxiety Scale (CAS). Background information (demographics, use    of technology) was gathered before conducting semistructured interviews.    We hypothesized that CAS would affect constructs of TAM and that    predictive constructs of TAM would have remained valid during the    pandemic. We also posited that there would be unidentified themes    outside TAM that impacted the acceptance and use of DCT. We used the    quantitative data to guide the semistructured interviews, which were    then analyzed through thematic analysis to identify additional themes.    Results: Correlational analysis showed that CAS influences all    constructs of TAM. We also saw that the predictive constructs of TAM,    especially the perceived ease of use (PEU) and perceived usefulness    (PU), remained valid during the pandemic. Common acceptance-influencing    themes were encountered in both quantitative and qualitative analyses,    with 3 matching the known constructs of TAM (PU, PEU, and behavioral    intention). We identified 2 additional themes affecting acceptance,    namely influence of the pandemic (situational context) and privacy and    security concerns. DCT use (especially email and videoconferencing use)    increased during the pandemic, but the results related to social    networking sites were mixed.    Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted technology acceptance and    use by older adults, encouraging their use of certain DCT apps (email    and videoconferencing apps, such as WhatsApp). These apps helped    insulate them from adverse effects (social isolation and loneliness).    Other social networking apps, however, exerted a negative influence,    increasing anxiety and a general feeling of negativity. Future studies    should maximize older adult agency related to design, privacy, security,    and user requirements for development. We also recommend that when    studying DCT acceptance for older adults, our additional identified    themes should be considered alongside the existing TAM constructs.","JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC","130 QUEENS QUAY East, Unit 1100, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",Article,English,"Balki, E (Corresponding Author), Univ Lancaster, Ctr Ageing \& Res, Div Hlth, Furness Bldg,Hazelrigg Ln, Lancaster LA1 4YG, England.

We also collected data on how    specific details and context make a legitimate SMS seem genuine. Our    findings indicate that participants focus more on the content, format,    and links in SMS rather than the sender's short code, phone number, or    email address.

To address    challenges, such as obstructed views and limitations in camera placement    in real-world scenarios, the CV method utilized video-derived    coordinates from a selected set of landmarks. A 2-D pose estimator    (HR-Net) detected landmark coordinates in each video frame, and a 3-D    algorithm (VideoPose3D) estimated the depth of each 2-D landmark by    analyzing its trajectories. The mean absolute precision error for the CV    method, compared to MoCap measurements using the same subset of    landmarks for estimating A, was 6.25 degrees (SD = 10.19 degrees, N =    360).

There has been a rise in data breaches and fraud,    particularly in banks, healthcare, and government sectors. In today's    world, many organizations offer their security specialists bug report    programs that help them find flaws in their applications. The breach of    data on its own does not necessarily constitute a threat or attack.    Cyber-attacks allow cyberpunks to gain access to machines and networks    and steal financial data and esoteric information as a result of a data    breach. In this context, this paper proposes an innovative approach to    help users to avoid online subterfuge by implementing a Dynamic Phishing    Safeguard System (DPSS) using neural boost phishing protection algorithm    that focuses on phishing, fraud, and optimizes the problem of data    breaches. Dynamic phishing safeguard utilizes 30 different features to    predict whether or not a website is a phishing website. In addition, the    neural boost phishing protection algorithm uses an Anti-Phishing Neural    Algorithm (APNA) and an Anti-Phishing Boosting Algorithm (APBA) to    generate output that is mapped to various other components, such as IP    finder, geolocation, and location mapper, in order to pinpoint the    location of vulnerable sites that the user can view, which makes the    system more secure. The system also offers a website blocker, and a    tracker auditor to give the user the authority to control the system.    Based on the results, the anti-phishing neural algorithm achieved an    accuracy level of 97.10\%, while the anti-phishing boosting algorithm    yielded 97.82\%. According to the evaluation results, dynamic phishing    safeguard systems tend to perform better than other models in terms of    uniform resource locator detection and security.",MDPI,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",Article,English,"Iwendi, C (Corresponding Author), Univ Bolton, Sch Creat Technol, Bolton BL3 5AB, England.

ACM,How to Hack into Facebook without being a Hacker,,2013,,,751-754,,"The proliferation of online social networking services has aroused    privacy concerns among the general public. The focus of such concerns    has typically revolved around providing explicit privacy guarantees to    users and letting users take control of the privacy-threatening aspects    of their online behavior, so as to ensure that private personal    information and materials are not made available to other parties and    not used for unintended purposes without the user's consent. As such    protective features are usually opt-in, users have to explicitly opt-in    for them in order to avoid compromising their privacy. Besides,    third-party applications may acquire a user's personal information, but    only after they have been granted consent by the user. If we also    consider potential network security attacks that intercept or misdirect    a user's online communication, it would appear that the discussion of    user vulnerability has accurately delimited the ways in which a user may    be exposed to privacy threats.    In this paper, we expose and discuss a previously unconsidered avenue by    which a user's privacy can be gravely exposed. Using this exploit, we    were able to gain complete access to some popular online social network    accounts without using any conventional method like phishing, brute    force, or trojans. Our attack merely involves a legitimate exploitation    of the vulnerability created by the existence of obsolete web-based    email addresses. We present the results of an experimental study on the    spread that such an attack can reach, and the ethical dilemmas we faced    in the process. Last, we outline our suggestions for defense mechanisms    that can be employed to enhance online security and thwart the kind of    attacks that we expose.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Parwani, T (Corresponding Author), Rutgers State Univ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.

IEEE,How well does GPT phish people? An investigation involving cognitive    biases and feedback,,2023,,,451-457,,"Phishing scams have increased drastically over the years. Prior research    has investigated various ways to prevent phishing email scams. However,    little is known about human decisions against phishing emails that    contain cognitive biases and are either crafted by humans or    large-language models (LLMs). Also, less is known about how humans can    be trained against such emails. This research aimed to address this    literature gap by investigating the effectiveness of human-crafted    phishing emails versus GPT-3 crafted phishing emails (GPT-3 being an    LLM). The study consisted of two between-subjects conditions (N = 30 per    condition): human and GPT. Each condition contained three rounds with a    total of 40 trials, and participants were required to mark the degree to    which the presented email was genuine or phishing in each trial. The    second round provided feedback to participants in both conditions. The    results showed that human-crafted emails were more effective in phishing    people compared to GPT-3 crafted emails even after training across    different cognitive biases. However, humans felt more confident against    human-crafted emails compared to GPT-3 crafted emails. We highlight the    implications of these results for LLM crafted phishing attacks compared    to human-crafted phishing attacks.",IEEE COMPUTER SOC,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Sharma, M (Corresponding Author), Indian Inst Technol, Mandi, Himachal Prades, India.

Advertising companies always want to    seamlessly reach consumers behind devices instead of the device itself.    However, the identity of consumers becomes fragmented as they switch    from one device to another. A naive attempt is to use deterministic    features such as user name, telephone number and email address. However    consumers might refrain from giving away their personal information    because of privacy and security reasons. The challenge in ICDM2015    contest is to develop an accurate probabilistic model for predicting    cross-device consumer identity without using the deterministic user    information.

Although many neighbor-based CF methods have been put forward, there are    still some open issues that have remained unsolved. First, the    ever-increasing volume of user-item rating data decreases the    recommendation efficiency significantly as a recommender system needs to    analyze all the rating data when searching for similar neighbors or    similar items. In this situation, users' requirements on quick response    may not be met. Second, in neighbor-based CF methods, more attention is    paid to the recommendation accuracy while other key indicators of    recommendation performances are often ignored, i.e., recommendation    diversity (RD), which probably produces similar or redundant items in    the recommended list and decreases users' satisfaction. Considering    these issues, a diversified and scalable recommendation method (called    DR\_LT) based on locality-sensitive hashing and cover tree is proposed    in this article, where the item topic information is used to optimize    the final recommended list.

The internet of things could connect patients to    health care providers, community services, and their living environments    to provide overarching support for self-management.    Objective: We aimed to identify patients' and clinicians' preferences    for a future internet-of-things system and explore their visions of its    potential to support holistic self-management.    Methods: In an exploratory sequential mixed methods study, we recruited    patients from volunteer databases and charities' social media. We    purposively sampled participants to interview them about their vision of    the design and utility of the internet of things as a future strategy    for supporting self-management. Respondents who were not invited to    participate in the interviews were invited to complete a web-based    questionnaire to prioritize the features suggested by the interviewees.    Clinicians were recruited from professional networks. Interviews were    transcribed and analyzed thematically using PRISMS self-management    taxonomy.    Results: We interviewed 12 patients and 12 clinicians in the United    Kingdom, and 140 patients completed the web-based questionnaires.    Patients expressed mostly wanting a system to log their asthma control    status automatically; provide real-time advice to help them learn about    their asthma, identify and avoid triggers, and adjust their treatment.    Peak flow (33/140, 23.6\%), environmental (pollen, humidity, air    temperature) (33/140, 23.6\%), and asthma symptoms (25/140, 17.9\%) were    the specific data types that patient most wanted. Information about    asthma and text or email access to clinical advice provided a feeling of    safety for patients. Clinicians wanted automated objective data about    the patients' condition that they could access during consultations. The    potential reduction in face-to-face consultations was appreciated by    clinicians which they perceived could potentially save patients' travel    time and health service resources. Lifestyle logs of fitness regimes or    weight control were valued by some patients but were of less interest to    clinicians.    Conclusions: An automated internet-of-things system that requires    minimal input from the user and provides timely advice in line with an    asthma action plan agreed by the patient with their clinician was    preferred by most respondents. Links to asthma information and the    ability to connect with clinicians by text or email were perceived by    patients as features that would provide a sense of safety. Further    studies are needed to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of    internet-of-things systems in routine clinical practice.","JMIR PUBLICATIONS, INC","130 QUEENS QUAY E, STE 1102, TORONTO, ON M5A 0P6, CANADA",Article,English,"Pinnock, H (Corresponding Author), Univ Edinburgh, Usher Inst, Asthma UK Ctr Appl Res, Old Med Sch, Teviot Pl, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.

This manuscript reports the qualitative data from the survey's    three open-ended questions. Free text, open-ended survey items were    analyzed by two independent coders for identification of common themes    using NVivo software. Theme agreement was reached through consensus and    count comparisons of participant responses were made.    Results: Healthcare system organizational challenges and meeting basic    needs and support were commonly reported themes among respondents (n =    274). Barriers to care delivery included organizational challenges,    patients' access to resources and support, concerns for patients' mental    and physical health, and telehealth challenges. Respondents reported    older adults were asking about their health and cancer care as well as    access to basic needs and supports. Providers described worrying about    patients' mental health, fear of personal safety, frustration in    multi-level institutions, as well as experiencing positive leadership    and communication.

ACM,Demo: Zero Interaction Private Messaging with ZIPR,,2014,,,351-352,,"Messaging app developers are beginning to take the security and privacy    of their users' communication more seriously. Unfortunately, a recent    study has shown that the developers of many popular apps incorrectly use    cryptography. As a result, they make mistakes that may result in    trivially broken encryption schemes. For example, the developers of    Snapchat use a constant symmetric encryption key hardcoded into the app    and it only takes 12 lines of Ruby to crack the encryption.    In this work, we propose ZIPR (Zero-Interaction PRivacy), a system that    relieves developers from the task of using cryptography correctly.    Designed for text-messaging apps, ZIPR automatically negotiates shared    secret keys, and encrypts and decrypts messages as users of these apps    chat with each other. No manual intervention is required by users for    them to enjoy secure messaging.    There are two key ideas behind ZIPR. First, most text-messaging apps    follow a basic UI scheme that contains (i) a text box for users to    compose their message, (ii) a ``send{''} button which they click on to    send the message, and (iii) a list view to display sent and received    messages. By intercepting events on these UI elements, ZIPR can    manipulate the composed message before it is sent and before it is    displayed. This allows the system to transparently encrypt and decrypt    message data.    The second key idea is that ZIPR can reuse the communication channel    defined by an app to negotiate a shared secret key between two users.    This is done by piggy-backing negotiation data on the messages users    send to each other. A major advantage of this approach is that ZIPR can    avoid the difficult task of establishing user identities. After all, a    user of a text-messaging app is likely to carry out a conversation only    with someone she knows, and both of them would have signed up for the    chat service using some personal data such as their email addresses or    phone numbers.    Developers use ZIPR by tagging UI elements; no changes to their source    code are required. This is similar to HTTPS where web developers only    need to configure their servers with SSL certificates to encrypt data    transmission with their users. However, unlike HTTPS, the end-to-end    encryption in ZIPR takes place between the two users carrying out a    conversation and not between a server and a user. This ensures that even    if the app servers are compromised, users' messages would remain secure.    ZIPR is implemented in Android 4.3 and works with existing apps with    very few modifications. In this demo, we show that our current prototype    works with several apps including Whatsapp, Facebook Messenger, and    Skype. These apps required only four, five, and three lines of    modification to their UI XML definition files, respectively.    In Figure 1, we show a screenshot of Whatsapp running under ZIPR. In the    first two messages exchanged between the users, a new shared secret key    is negotiated. Subsequently, all following messages are securely    transmitted, and these encrypted messages are prefixed with a ``{*}'' by    ZIPR.    We are currently extending our prototype to use the Android Keystore API    and the TrustZone hardware to allow users to identify MitM attacks, and    to store the secret keys securely. We are also porting other messaging    apps, such as Viber, to ZIPR.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Razeen, A (Corresponding Author), Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.

Meanwhile, information and communication technologies (ICT), such as the    internet, mobile phones, and smartphones, are spreading worldwide,    including in low- and middle-income countries. We reviewed the available    evidence on the use of ICT-based interventions to address intimate    partner violence (IPV), evaluating the effectiveness, acceptability, and    suitability of ICT for addressing different aspects of the problem    (e.g., awareness, screening, prevention, treatment, mental    health).MethodsWe conducted a systematic review, following PRISMA    guidelines, using the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of    Science. Key search terms included women, violence, domestic violence,    intimate partner violence, information, communication technology, ICT,    technology, email, mobile, phone, digital, ehealth, web, computer,    online, and computerized. Only articles written in English were    included.ResultsTwenty-five studies addressing screening and disclosure,    IPV prevention, ICT suitability, support and women's mental health were    identified. The evidence reviewed suggests that ICT-based interventions    were effective mainly in screening, disclosure, and prevention. However,    there is a lack of homogeneity among the studies' outcome measurements    and the sample sizes, the control groups used (if any), the type of    interventions, and the study recruitment space. Questions addressing    safety, equity, and the unintended consequences of the use of ICT in IPV    programming are virtually non-existent.ConclusionsThere is a clear need    to develop women-centered ICT design when programming for IPV. Our study    showed only one study that formally addressed software usability. The    need for more research to address safety, equity, and the unintended    consequences of the use of ICT in IPV programming is paramount.

IEEE,Automated generation of ham rules for Vietnamese spam filtering,,2014,,,36-40,,"The topic of spam filtering has been thoroughly studied by researchers    in the past few decades. There has been successful works with high spam    detection rates, yet no paper has described a method which can    effectively detect spam and, at the same time, measure the importance of    ham emails. In this paper, the authors propose a method of generating    SpamAssassin rules which can indicate the degree of importance of an    email message. Specifically we added a proportion of negatively weighted    ham rules and adapted HPSOWM, an efficient evolutionary algorithm, to    optimize SpamAssassin rule scores. As a result, using our new rule set,    SpamAssassin is able to give indicative scores for both spam and ham.    These scores can be utilized by email clients to categorize incoming    messages based on their importance to user. Various experiments were    conducted to evaluate our method. In addition, a conclusion was drawn    about the best ratio of spam rules and ham rules.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Dinh, QD (Corresponding Author), Univ Hanoi, Fac Informat Technol, Hanoi, Vietnam.

However, concerns are raised for the privacy risks of user data since    they have been frequently shared among researchers, advertisers, and    application developers. To solve this problem, a number of anonymization    algorithms have been recently developed for protecting the privacy of    social graphs. In this article, we proposed a graph node similarity    measurement in consideration with both graph structure and descriptive    information, and a deanonymization algorithm based on the measurement.    Using the proposed algorithm, we evaluated the privacy risks of several    typical anonymization algorithms on social graphs with thousands of    nodes from Microsoft Academic Search, LiveJournal, and the Enron email    dataset, and a social graph with millions of nodes from Tencent Weibo.    Our results showed that the proposed algorithm was efficient and    effective to deanonymize social graphs without any initial seed    mappings.

Passive acoustics, particularly from    autonomous vehicles, is a promising approach to meeting this need. We    have previously developed the capability to record, detect, classify,    and transmit to shore information about the tonal sounds of baleen    whales in near real time from long-endurance ocean gliders. We have    recently developed a protocol by which a human analyst reviews this    information to determine the presence of marine mammals, and the results    of this review are automatically posted to a publicly accessible    website, sent directly to interested parties via email or text, and made    available to stakeholders via a number of public and private digital    applications. We evaluated the performance of this system during two    3.75-month Slocum glider deployments in the southwestern Gulf of Maine    during the spring seasons of 2015 and 2016. Near real-time detections of    humpback, fin, sei, and North Atlantic right whales were compared to    detections of these species from simultaneously recorded audio. Data    from another 2016 glider deployment in the same area were also used to    compare results between three different analysts to determine    repeatability of results both among and within analysts. False detection    (occurrence) rates on daily time scales were 0\% for all species. Daily    missed detection rates ranged from 17 to 24\%. Agreement between two    trained novice analysts and an experienced analyst was greater than 95\%    for fin, sei, and right whales, while agreement was 83-89\% for humpback    whales owing to the more subjective process for detecting this species.    Our results indicate that the presence of baleen whales can be    accurately determined using information about tonal sounds transmitted    in near real-time from Slocum gliders. The system is being used    operationally to monitor baleen whales in United States, Canadian, and    Chilean waters, and has been particularly useful for monitoring the    critically endangered North Atlantic right whale throughout the    northwestern Atlantic Ocean.",FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",Review,English,"Baumgartner, MF (Corresponding Author), Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Dept Biol, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.

In the phishing simulations campaign    with 8,102 participants, unannounced, monthly phishing emails with    different templates are sent during regular work hours over a duration    of 2 years, and the reactions (clicking the link and reporting the    phishing email) are collected. The results are combined with demographic    and relevant organizational data such as age, gender, level of    education, department type, tenure, and job level. Multivariate logistic    regression models are developed to analyze the relationship between    these variables and phishing behaviors. The analysis reveals significant    differences in susceptibility to and resilience against phishing attacks    across various demographic and organizational groups. Older employees    are more susceptible to phishing, while males show lower vulnerability    to phishing attacks. Additionally, our results revealed that    higher-level employees often under report phishing emails.

IEEE,Detecting Sensitive Information from Unstructured Text in a    Data-Constrained Environment,,2023,,,,,"For an enterprise, it is important to handle sensitive customer data    properly because any data breach or violation can lead to hefty    penalties. Past work has looked at various techniques for detecting    sensitive data in free-flowing text for a given regulation. However,    most of them either produce many false positives or are very specific to    certain types of data, for example, email, account number, or social    security number. Moreover, machine learning-based methods are difficult    to use as finding large amounts of labeled data for training a    supervised model poses a serious challenge. In this work, we aim to    address the issue of sensitive data discovery in a data-constrained    environment by utilizing pre-trained models. We compare their    effectiveness in the financial and health domains. Further, we improve    the performance of pre-trained models by employing morphological-level    features and propose a hybrid model architecture. Our experimental    results show that pretrained models in a data-constrained environment    can reduce the turnaround time for sensitive data discovery, thus saving    money and effort.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Anand, S (Corresponding Author), TCS Res, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.

IEEE,Session-based Access Control in Information-Centric Networks: Design and    Analyses,,2014,,,,,"Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has been proposed recently to    improve the efficiency of content delivery in current IP networks. ICN    employs data names, instead of host addresses, as routing and forwarding    indicators. Content in the ICN carries only signature of the content    provider but does not contain the identity of the content consumer by    default. Such information is, however, essential for many of the web    applications, such as email, online social networking, online game,    e-commerce, and other session-based web services.    In this paper, we propose a session-based access control (SAC) mechanism    for ICN scenario to bridge the gap. Key distribution protocols are    designed to protect the confidentiality of the content during    information delivery. We also employ a dynamic naming scheme to enhance    user privacy. According to security analysis, our access control    mechanism can provide communication security and privacy protection for    both sides of the session.

However the security of these systems needs more consideration for the    sensitive health information of patients. Some protocols on how to    secure the e-health cloud system have been proposed, but many of them    use the traditional PKI infrastructure to implement cryptographic    mechanisms, which is cumbersome for they require every user having and    remembering its own public/private keys. Identity based encryption (IBE)    is a cryptographic primitive which uses the identity information of the    user (e.g., email address) as the public key. Hence the public key is    implicitly authenticated and the certificate management is simplified.    Proxy re-encryption is another cryptographic primitive which aims at    transforming a ciphertext under the delegator A into another ciphertext    which can be decrypted by the delegatee B. In this paper, we describe    several identity related cryptographic techniques for securing E-health    system, which include new IBE schemes, new identity based proxy    re-encryption (IBPRE) schemes. We also prove these schemes' security and    give the performance analysis, the results show our IBPRE scheme is    especially highly efficient for re-encryption, which can be used to    achieve cost-effective cloud usage.

"Pienta, Dan and Thatcher, Jason Bennett and Wright, Ryan T. and Roth,    Philip L.",An Empirical Investigation of The Unintended Consequences of    Vulnerability Assessments Leading to Betrayal,JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS,2024,25,4,,,"When cybersecurity units conduct vulnerability assessments to evaluate    the security of organizations, they can have unintended consequences for    employees. Although cybersecurity personnel may view tactics such as    fake phishing attacks and email scanning as protective measures,    employees may view them as threats because being singled out as a    security risk can harm their standing in the organization. To understand    the implications of vulnerability assessments, we examine how    organizations' use of different tactics to identify user vulnerabilities    can lead employees to feel betrayed by the cybersecurity unit, resulting    in negative cybersecurity outcomes. Drawing on the theory of betrayal    aversion, we develop a model that shows that when employees perceive    these tactics as harmful, they can lead to an affective state of    cybersecurity betrayal, resulting in a damaged relationship with the    cybersecurity unit. In collaboration with an organization's    cybersecurity unit, we evaluated our model using an experimental    vignette survey, post hoc interviews, and a crosssectional survey with    two samples (i.e., employees in the organization and employees from a    panel). We found that when organizations conduct vulnerability    assessments to enhance cybersecurity, they often induce an affective    state of betrayal and increase employees' active resistance to    cybersecurity (i.e., abandonment, avoidance, and sabotage of    cybersecurity policies, technologies, and units). The paper concludes    with implications for research and practice that explain the unintended    consequences of vulnerability assessment and betrayal.",ASSOC INFORMATION SYSTEMS,"GEORGIA STATE UNIV, 35 BROAD STREET, STE 916-917, ATLANTA, GA 30303 USA",Article,English,"Pienta, D (Corresponding Author), Univ Tennessee, Dept Accounting \& Informat Management, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.

However, the enforcement of regulations    concerning vehicle violations in IoV environments predominantly relies    on manual methods, which are both expensive and challenging. Moreover,    the inherent constraints in existing surveillance systems result in    regulatory blind spots. Consequently, it is imperative to develop    intelligent IoV-based surveillance mechanisms to improve the efficiency    of detecting and rectifying violations. In this article, we propose a    blockchain-based self-supervision model for vehicle violations that    utilizes intervehicle reporting and voting mechanisms to enhance the    detection rate of violations and reduce regulatory pressure. A forensic    blockchain is introduced in the model to enable a review of the    reporting results, which improves the security and reliability of the    system. Additionally, more vehicles are incentivized to participate in    the system through reputation-based rewards, punishments, and    incentives. The system was deployed on the Hyperledger Fabric platform.    Simulation experiments were conducted using Veins, SUMO, and OMNeT++.    The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the model.

Methods During a 12-month period ending in June 2021, the    prescribing information and published monographs from multiple pharmacy    compendia were reviewed for all medications and biologic products    approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for human use    since January 2000. Products that were subsequently withdrawn from the    US market were excluded. When temperature excursion data was unavailable    in published form, product manufacturers were surveyed via telephone    and/or email. Acceptable storage information for all products for which    storage is recommended at temperatures below room temperature (20-25    degrees C {[}68-77 degrees F]) was compiled and arranged in tabular    format. Results Of the 705 products or formulations approved by FDA    during the predefined time period, 246 were identified as requiring    storage at temperatures below room temperature. After review of    available prescribing information and manufacturer communications, if    applicable, acceptable periods of excursion to temperatures at room    temperature or higher were identified for 214 products (87\%).

Although current anti-phishing tools achieve high    accuracy rates and present a potential solution to this problem, users    are often reluctant to rely on the predictions of these competent tools.    However, we continue to lack a means of resolving this reluctance-or    even an explanation for it. To address this need and advance toward a    solution, we inves-tigate the factors that influence users' reliance on    anti-phishing tools. Over the course of two studies, we test the effects    of tool attributes (i.e., accuracy and frequency of phishing email    predictions) and develop a model based on the notions of trust and    distrust. Countering the common conjecture that tools are not accurate    enough, we find that users' under-reliance is not an artifact of the    insufficient accuracy of tools, as even in a 100\% accuracy condition,    users were under-reliant on tools. Rather, we find that while accuracy    increases users' trust in tools, full reliance is inhibited by users'    distrust, which is driven by a lack of transparency regarding tools'    function-alities and the quantity of predictions provided. Thus,    overall, our study shows the limits of accuracy in engendering reliance    and explains the under-reliance phenomenon by showing that due to lack    of knowledge or understanding, some users prefer to rely on their own    inferior judgment instead of trusting and relying on the predictions    provided by highly accurate tools.",ELSEVIER,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",Article,English,"Schuetz, SW (Corresponding Author), Florida Int Univ, Coll Business, Dept Informat Syst \& Business Analyt, Miami, FL 33199 USA.

IEEE,Beyond Credential Stuffing: Password Similarity Models using Neural    Networks,,2019,,BO3ED,417-434,,"Attackers increasingly use passwords leaked from one website to    compromise associated accounts on other websites. Such targeted attacks    work because users reuse, or pick similar, passwords for different    websites. We recast one of the core technical challenges underlying    targeted attacks as the task of modeling similarity of human-chosen    passwords. We show how to learn good password similarity models using a    compilation of 1.4 billion leaked email, password pairs.    Using our trained models of password similarity, we exhibit the most    damaging targeted attack to date. Simulations indicate that our attack    compromises more than 16\% of user accounts in less than a thousand    guesses, should one of their other passwords be known to the attacker    and despite the use of state-of-the-art countermeasures. We show via a    case study involving a large university authentication service that the    attacks are also effective in practice. We go on to propose the    first-ever defense against such targeted attacks, by way of personalized    password strength meters (PPSMs). These are password strength meters    that can warn users when they are picking passwords that are vulnerable    to attacks, including targeted ones that take advantage of the user's    previously compromised passwords. We design and build a PPSM that can be    compressed to less than 3 MB, making it easy to deploy in order to    accurately estimate the strength of a password against all known    guessing attacks.",IEEE COMPUTER SOC,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Pal, B (Corresponding Author), Cornell Tech, New York, NY 10044 USA.

SocialBots are the    bots present in Online Social Network (OSN) which mimic the activities    of the real users. They have the capability to automatically perform the    basic functionalities offered by the OSN platforms. These socialbots    have widespread usage in political campaigning and product marketing,    but SocialBots can also been used for the purpose of swaying voters,    mounting political attacks, manipulating public opinion, etc. Apart from    these, SocialBots posses various security risks, one of which is    befriending an OSN user thereby gaining access to personal details such    as birthday, email id, phone number, address, etc. Detection of these    SocialBots is therefore an important problem to be solved in order to    maintain the reputation of OSN. Our work concentrates on behavioral    analysis of these SocialBots in the OSN and identifying features to be    used to develop a model for detection of these Socialbots using machine    learning. The model, thus developed, is further used as a background    process to create a web-based tool for detection of SocialBots. In our    work, we created a SocialBot to perform behavioral analysis.

This study aims to    investigate the psycholinguistic factors associated with deception in    phishing email text and their effect on end-user ability to discriminate    phishing emails from legitimate emails. Design/methodology/approachEmail    messages and end-user decisions collected from a laboratory phishing    study were validated and analyzed using natural language processing    methods (Linguistic Inquiry Word Count) and penalized regression models    (LASSO and Elastic Net) to determine the linguistic dimensions that    attackers may use in phishing emails to deceive end-users and measure    the impact of such choices on end-user susceptibility to phishing.    FindingsWe found that most participants, who played the role of a    phisher in the study, chose to deceive their end-user targets by    pretending to be a familiar individual and presenting time pressure or    deadlines. Results show that use of words conveying certainty (e.g.    always, never) and work-related features in the phishing messages    predicted higher end-user vulnerability. On the contrary, use of words    that convey achievement (e.g. earn, win) or reward (cash, money) in the    phishing messages predicted lower end-user vulnerability because such    features are usually observed in scam-like messages. Practical    implicationsInsights from this research show that analyzing emails for    psycholinguistic features associated with computer-mediated deception    could be used to fine-tune and improve spam and phishing detection    technologies. This research also informs the kinds of phishing attacks    that must be prioritized in antiphishing training programs.    Originality/valueApplying natural language processing and statistical    modeling methods to analyze results from a laboratory phishing    experiment to understand deception from both attacker and end-user is    novel.

Current navigation systems tend to focus on identifying the    shortest or fastest routes between two points.

As businesses virtually    eliminated in-person experiences, the COVID-19 pandemic changed the way    we live and caused a mass migration to digital platforms. However, this    shift also made people more vulnerable to cyber-crime. Victims are being    targeted by attackers for their credentials or financial rewards, or    both. This is because the Internet itself is inherently difficult to    secure, and the attackers can code in a way that exploits its flaws.    Once the attackers gain root access to the devices, they have complete    control and can do whatever they want. Consequently, taking advantage of    highly unprecedented circumstances created by the Covid-19 event,    cybercriminals launched massive phishing, malware, identity theft, and    ransomware attacks. Therefore, if we wish to save people from these    frauds in times when millions have already been tipped into poverty and    the rest are trying hard to sustain, it is imperative to curb these    attacks and attackers. This paper analyses the impact of Covid-19 on    various cyber-security related aspects and sketches out the timeline of    Covid-19 themed cyber-attacks launched globally to identify the modus    operandi of the attackers and the impact of attacks. It also offers a    thoroughly researched set of mitigation strategies which can be employed    to prevent the attacks in the first place. Moreover, this manuscript    proposes a fuzzy logic and data mining-based intelligence system for    detecting Covid-19 themed malicious URL/phishing attacks. The    performance of the system has been evaluated against various    malicious/phishing URLs, and it was observed that the proposed system is    a viable solution to this problem.

Patient    factors (e.g., irritable behavior; mental illness) can evoke strong    emotions, and evidence suggests that these emotions can impact care    quality and patient safety. Given that nurses play a critical role in    providing high quality care, efforts to identify and remedy factors that    may compromise care are needed. Yet to date, few experiments have been    conducted.Objective: To examine the effects of emotionally evocative    patient behavior as well as the presence of mental illness on emergency    nurses' emotions, patient assessments, testing advocacy, and written    handoffs.Design: Experimental vignette research.Setting: Online    experiment distributed via email between October and December    2020.Participants: Convenience sample of 130 emergency nurses from seven    hospitals in the Northeastern United States and one hospital in the    mid-Atlantic region in the United States.Methods: Nurses completed four    multimedia computer-simulated patient encounters in which patient    behavior (irritable vs. calm) and mental illness (present vs. absent)    were experimentally varied. Nurses reported their emotions and clinical    assessments, recommended diagnostic tests, and provided written    handoffs. Tests were coded for whether the test would result in a    correct diagnosis, and handoffs were coded for negative and positive    patient descriptions and the presence of speafic clinical    information.Results: Nurses experienced more negative emotions (anger,    unease) and reported less engagement when assessing patients exhibiting    irritable (vs. calm) behavior. Nurses also judged patients with    irritable (vs. calm) behavior as more likely to exaggerate their pain    and as poorer historians, and as less likely to cooperate, return to    work, and recover. Nurses' handoffs were more likely to communicate    negative descriptions of patients with irritable (vs. calm) behavior and    omit speafic clinical information (e.g., whether tests were ordered,    per-sonal information). The presence of mental illness increased unease    and sadness and resulted in nurses being less likely to recommend a    necessary test for a correct diagnosis.Conclusions: Emergency nurses'    assessments and handoffs were impacted by patient factors, particularly    irritable patient behavior. As nurses are central to the clinical team    and experience regular, close contact with patients, the effects of    irritable patient behavior on nursing assessments and care practices    have important implications. We discuss potential approaches to address    these ill effects, including reflexive practice, teamwork, and    standardiza-tion of handoffs.Tweetable abstract: Experimental evidence    links irritable patient behaviors to lower quality emergency depart-ment    nurse handoffs, which may compromise patient safety @(lindamisbell)    @(Nathan\_Huff\_1).(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

To better understand this, we propose a    dimensional framework to identify the thematic nature of phishing emails    that would not only help to understand the underlining technical    subterfuge but also enhance our knowledge to effectively sense    contextual social engineering tricks and the nature of such attacks,    from multiple angles. To validate the dimensional elements, we will    employ topic modeling techniques to analyze the themes of fraudulent    email attack utilizing four benchmark datasets. Based on the analysis,    this study discusses theoretical contributions and practical    recommendations along with further directions of the research.",ASSOC INFORMATION SYSTEMS,"P.O.

Especially when dealing with    sensitive data as inserting grades for courses. So in this paper we    present a system called Secure Mobile Cloud Computing for Sensitive    Data: Teacher Services for Palestinian Higher Education Institutions    (MCCTSs) which is a mobile application to facilities access using RSA    algorithm to encrypt the data which sent and received through Cloud    computing application. MCCTSs serve the lecturers of Palestinian higher    education institutions. Agile methodology was adapted to develop MCCTSs    application. MCCTSs users successfully insert the grades securely and    encrypted any time anywhere using RSA algorithm. It is hoped that the    result of this study will encourage the universities to engage MCCTSs in    their services. From the results we obtained, it is proved that RSA    provides protection for the data, which is stored in Cloud. Only    authorized user can read the encrypted data and decrypt it.

They are both monetarily and technologically costly, as well    as extremely harmful to computers and networks. Despite the rise of    social networks and other Internet-based information exchange venues,    email communication has become increasingly important over time,    necessitating the urgent improvement of spam filters. Although various    spam filters have been developed to help prevent spam emails from    reaching a user's mailbox, there has been little research into text    modifications. Because of its simplicity and efficiency, Naive Bayes is    currently one of the most used methods of spam classification. However,    when emails contain leetspeak or diacritics, Naive Bayes is unable to    correctly categorize them. As a result, we created a novel method to    improve the accuracy of the Naive Bayes Spam Filter to detect text    alterations and correctly classify emails as Spam or ham in this    proposal. When compared to Spamassassin, our Python approach uses a    combination of semantic, keyword, and machine learning algorithms to    improve Naive Bayes accuracy. Furthermore, we identified a link between    email length and spam score, indicating that Bayesian Poisoning, a    contentious concept, is an actual occurrence used by spammers.

The    model identifies individual psychological motivation, which influences    innovation assimilation intention and behavior. It constitutes an    organizational management view of SSD innovation assimilation from    individual psychological motivation perspective.    Design/methodology/approach An empirical study was employed to verify    the assumption model. Semi-structured user interviews were conducted    with some security experts to consult their advice and obtain the    measurement scales. And questionnaires were circulated at a focus group    meeting and among some software security professionals by email. Of 230    questionnaires that were answered, 215 could be used. IBM SPSS 19.0 and    AMOS 17.0 were used alternately to analyze the data. Structural equation    model was employed to verify the hypotheses of the model.    Findings Results reveal that two types of individual motivation can    influence SSD innovation assimilation, namely, potential organization    support and individual needs. Furthermore, absorption capability was    found to play a regulated function in the transition of SSD assimilation    intention to behavior.    Originality/value The findings reveal how individual motivation plays an    important role in promoting complex innovation assimilation. It fills    the gap of the research on organizational assimilation behavior and    individual motivation in the context of SSD complex innovation, and    provides management of software development organization with    empirically based conceptualization to guide their personnel incentive    policymaking.",EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",Article,English,"Song, MQ (Corresponding Author), Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Econ \& Management, Dalian, Peoples R China.

IEEE,Aggregated Risk Modelling of Personal Data Privacy in Internet of Things,,2019,,,425-430,,"There is a growing interest in personal data mining and user profiling    to improve the surveillance practices for rapid analysis of underlying    business patterns. User profiling from Personally Identifiable    Information (PII) is one such technique to breach personal data privacy    in mobile devices, web browser, smart homes, Internet of Things (IoT)    etc. This study proposes a PIT risk factor by bringing aggregated risk    modelling of personal information in the IoT environment. Intuitively,    most of the IoT devices are produced by identical manufacturers.    Similarly, smart devices typically assemble facts from plentiful devices    where collected information's owners are mutually inclusive. Proposed    Massive Personal Information Clustering (MPIC) model shows that IoT    product manufacturing companies can cluster PIT collected from a) IoT    device managing application and b) device data flow. Subsequently,    owner-centric aggregated IoT device data can reveal user ID, which was    not considered by other studies. Our approach was validated by    satisfactory data analysis from IoT standardization organization (Open    Connectivity Forum), Android and iOS app store. The analysis shows 80-90    percent of available ToT devices are manufactured by 6-10 major    companies with 5 potential PIT threats. Personal information like    location, email, biological ID, contextual actions and social graph are    at risk if collective information gathering (aggregation) through    multiple IoT devices are not correctly measured. Finally, research    directions in establishing privacy preservation in smart IoT ecosystem    are advocated.",IEEE,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",Proceedings Paper,English,"Yang, J (Corresponding Author), Inje Univ, Dept Healthcare \& Informat Technol, Gimhae 50834, South Korea.

ACM,Comparative Privacy Analysis of Mobile Browsers,,2023,,,3-14,,"Online trackers are invasive as they track our digital footprints, many    of which are sensitive in nature, and when aggregated over time, they    can help infer intricate details about our lifestyles and habits.    Although much research has been conducted to understand the    effectiveness of existing countermeasures for the desktop platform,    little is known about how mobile browsers have evolved to handle online    trackers. With mobile devices now generating more web traffic than their    desktop counterparts, we fill this research gap through a large-scale    comparative analysis of mobile web browsers. We crawl 10K valid websites    from the Tranco list on real mobile devices. Our data collection process    covers both popular generic browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, and Safari)    as well as privacy-focused browsers (e.g., Brave, Duck Duck Go, and    Firefox-Focus). We use dynamic analysis of runtime execution traces and    static analysis of source codes to highlight the tracking behavior of    invasive fingerprinters. We also find evidence of tailored content being    served to different browsers. In particular, we note that Firefox Focus    sees altered script code, whereas Brave and Duck Duck Go have highly    similar content. To test the privacy protection of browsers, we measure    the responses of each browser in blocking trackers and advertisers and    note the strengths and weaknesses of privacy browsers. To establish    ground truth, we use well-known block lists, including EasyList,    EasyPrivacy, Disconnect and WhoTracksMe and find that Brave generally    blocks the highest number of content that should be blocked as per these    lists. Focus performs better against social trackers, and Duck Duck Go    restricts third-party trackers that perform email-based tracking.",ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",Proceedings Paper,English,"Zafar, A (Corresponding Author), North Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.

Phishers mainly use spoofed emails or instant    messages to lure users to the phishing websites. A spoofed email or    instant message provides the first-layer context to entice users to    click on a phishing URL, and the phishing website further provides the    second-layer context with the look and feel similar to a targeted    legitimate website to lure users to submit their login credentials. In    this paper, we focus on the second-layer context to explore the extreme    of phishing attacks; we explore the feasibility of creating extreme    phishing attacks that have the almost identical look and feel as those    of the targeted legitimate websites, and evaluate the effectiveness of    such phishing attacks. We design and implement a phishing toolkit that    can support both the traditional phishing and the newly emergent Web    Single Sign-On (SSO) phishing; our toolkit can automatically construct    unlimited levels of phishing webpages in real time based on user    interactions. We design and perform a user study with 194 participants    to evaluate the effectiveness of the phishing attacks constructed from    this toolkit. The results demonstrate that extreme phishing attacks are    indeed highly effective and insidious as over 90\% of the participants    became the ``victims{''}. It is reasonable to assume that extreme    phishing attacks will be widely adopted and deployed in the future, and    we call for a collective effort to effectively defend against them.

IEEE,Smart Early Fire and Smoke Detection with Transfer Learning,,2024,,395,,,"In this study, a low latent edge-based fire and smoke detection and    alert system was designed to detect and prevent indoor fires caused by    human or machine faults, or lack of appropriate fire safety measures. To    live comfortably in this fast-paced society, safety is a must. To detect    early signs of fire, smoke and flammable gases, a real-time fire    detection system was developed by combining a Raspberry Pi and a    Raspberry Pi camera v2. Images taken from an open-source fire and smoke    dataset were annotated and fed to the models. The model selection    involved training YOLOv4-tiny, YOLOv5s TensorFlow lite pre-trained    models, and deploying the most feasible transfer learned model having a    higher mean average precision (mAP) on Raspberry Pi, which acts as the    edge device. It performs real-time analysis of live feed captured by a    Raspberry Pi camera, sends email alerts to the user stating confirmation    of the presence of fire or smoke, and prevents false alarms caused due    to the data collected by IoT devices by conducting a double check with    the captured feed for detection. The user can act upon this notification    and ensure timely preventive action. The proposed state-of-the-art    indoor alert system achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 42.3 for    fire, 35.4 for smoke classes; a precision of 58.5 for fire, 64.3 for    smoke and a recall of 45.9 for fire and 33.3 for smoke respectively.

In this letter, we show that two identity-based    authenticated key agreement protocols proposed by Holbl and Welzer are    completely broken.",IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",Article,English,"Shim, KA (Corresponding Author), Natl Inst Math Sci, Div Fusion \& Convergence Math Sci, KT Daedoek Res Ctr 2, 463-1 Jeonmin Dong, Taejon, South Korea.

"Kotsovinos, Evangelos and Friese, Ingo and Kurze, Martin and Heuer, Jorg",A role-based architecture for seamless identity management and effective    task separation,,2007,232,BGG50,289-300,,"Today's on-line end user experience is compromised by the need for    managing multiple redundant identities for access to various services -    such as email accounts, in order to ensure a clear separation of tasks    that users perform in different capacities. Approaches based on Single    Sign On (SSO) have focused on the provision of interoperability and    trust management solutions required to allow users to log in once and    use multiple on-line services. In this paper, we argue that Single Sign    On provides neither adequate privacy preservation nor sufficient    fine-grained separation of tasks, as it requires that a user performs    all tasks - whether e.g. personal or professional - using the same    identity. We propose Identity and Role Management (IRM), a new approach    to identity management, combining the benefits of SSO and user-centric    frameworks: it allows a user to be authenticated as conveniently as with    SSO, to still achieve an effective separation of tasks she performs in    different capacities through the use of different roles, and to retain    full control of her private and sensitive data. Additionally, it    facilitates fine-grained service customisation, supporting a    personalised on-line experience. Our experiments with real users    demonstrate the effectiveness, transparency, and user acceptance of our    solution.",SPRINGER,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",Proceedings Paper,English,,,1571-5736,,,Computer Science; Telecommunications,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information    Systems; Computer Science, Theory \& Methods; Telecommunications",inproceedings,WOS:000246676500025,"Venter, H and Eloff, M and Labuschagne, L and Eloff, J and VonSolms, R","New Approaches for Security, Privacy and Trust in Complex Environments",INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION FOR INFORMATION PROCESSING,"22nd International Information Security Conference, Sandton, SOUTH    AFRICA, MAY 14-16, 2007",978-0-387-72366-2,,IFIP TC 11,,19,0,0,0,,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),WOS:000246676500025,2025-07-09,,,,,
