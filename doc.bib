abstract = {Email is ubiquitous, and in the context of phishing, it becomes critical, as risky behaviours like clicking on phishing links or downloading malicious files can lead to severe consequences. While much research exists on phishing susceptibility, there is still a gap in understanding factors that influence user micro-behaviour when interacting with phishing emails. To address this, we offer a tool, the Precision Email Simulator, to support phishing researchers, as well as considerations in conceptualising controlled ‘experimental simulation’ studies, which are currently underutilised in phishing research. The Precision Email Simulator simulates real-world email inboxes and tracks precision user data, such as time spent on messages and eye-tracking for key areas like URLs and sender addresses. We discuss the practical uses of our simulator, and provide recommendations and guidelines of using our email simulator.},

abstract = {We introduce the concept of Public Security User Interfaces as an innovative approach to enhancing cybersecurity awareness and promoting security behavior change among users in public spaces. We envision these interfaces as dynamic platforms that leverage interactive elements and contextual cues to deliver timely security information and guidance to users. We identify four key objectives: raising awareness, triggering actions, providing control, and sparking conversation. Drawing upon Sasse et al.’s Security Learning Curve, we outline the stages for supporting users in adopting new security-related routines into habits, encompassing knowledge, concordance, self-efficacy, implementation, embedding, and secure behavior. Insights from research on public displays and spontaneous interactions inform the design of public security user interfaces tailored to different environments and user groups. Furthermore, we propose research questions pertaining to stakeholders, content, user interface design, and effects on users and discuss challenges as well as limitations. Introducing public security user interfaces to bridge the gap between cybersecurity experts and lay users sets the stage for future research and development in this emerging field.},

abstract = {Phishing remains one of the most prevalent attack vectors in the modern cybersecurity landscape. Though filters and other provider-side methods are useful in blocking certain categories of phishing emails, it remains evident that the weakest link in email security is the user. With the advent of LLMs as highly accessible and easy-to-use tools for text generation, the employment of these tools in the creation of phishing emails is almost certainly a current reality. In this study, we evaluate the likelihood of over 160 undergraduate students correctly labeling both human and LLM emails as phishing (also referred to as malign in this paper) or real (also referred to as benign in this paper) emails in a semi-controlled environment both with and without time pressures. We find that LLM generated emails are a possible security weakness for this user group and deserve increased attention. We also find that certain personality traits measured by the Need for Cognition (a trait described as a need to structure relevant situations in meaningful, integrated ways and a need to understand and make reasonable the experiential world [7]) scale and the Big Five personality Inventory may correlate with a higher likelihood of susceptibility to being phished depending on the email source. We present possible explanations for these findings and propose future work in training and research on this growing concern.},

abstract = {With the massive increase in the usage of user accounts, it is very important to build a strong defence mechanism for protecting the user from malicious attackers. Modern systems use different types of defence mechanisms such as password protection, two-step verification, secret question answering etc. to protect the users however these systems have their flaws which requires addressing and further work. Email verification is a very common and useful method for doing user authentication. Email can be used as a master key for all other systems. Because of that if the email address gets compromised, an attacker can compromise all other systems that are connected to the affected email address. This paper addresses this issue and proposes EmAc, an authentication system that uses traditional email verification for making the first step of the authentication, however, it will do further authentication using user activity of each individual system as well.},

This article draws from more than 9 years of our work at Google to understand and support the digital safety of at-risk users—including survivors of intimate partner abuse, people involved with political campaigns, content creators, youth, and more—in technology intended for broad use. Among our learnings is that designing for inclusive digital safety across widely varied user needs and dynamic contexts is a wicked problem with no “correct” solution. Given this, we describe frameworks and design principles we have developed to help make at-risk research findings practically applicable to technologies intended for broad use and lessons we have learned about communicating them to practitioners.},

The agent has three actions: Check Header, Check Body and Make Decision. Check Header and Check Body are used to analyze the header and body information of emails, and Make Decision is responsible for giving structured decision results based on the previous analysis results. Unlike previous email classification systems, our system provides users with detailed evidence-based reasons for judgment while giving judgment results. The performance of the system was evaluated on a novel phishing email dataset, and the experimental results show that the agent system, using the GLM-4 large language model for example, achieves 99.30% accuracy. Our study gives a new practical approach for the application of LLMs-based agents in the field of cyber security.},

abstract = {Active transportation is a valuable tool to prevent some of the most common causes of mortality worldwide, but is severely underutilized. The primary factors preventing cyclist adoption are safety concerns, specifically, the fear of collision from automobiles. One solution to address this concern is to direct cyclists to known safe routes to minimize risk and stress, thus making cycling more approachable. However, few localized safety priors are available, hindering safety based routing. Specifically, road user behavior is unknown. To address this issue, we develop a novel handlebar attachment to passively monitor the proximity of passing cars as a an indicator of cycling safety along historically traveled routes. We deploy this sensor with 15 experienced cyclists in a 2 month longitudinal study to source a citywide map of car passing distance. We then compare this signal to both historic collisions and perceived safety reported by experienced and inexperienced cyclists.},

Key adoption factors were “perceived usefulness,” “ease of use,” and “self efficacy.” We also identified barriers to changing compromised passwords, including alert fatigue, low perceived urgency, and reliance on other security measures. We then designed interfaces mitigating these issues through clearer messaging and automation (e.g., simultaneous password changes and direct links to change pages). A user study (N=50) showed our designs significantly improved password change success rates, reaching 40% and 74% in runtime alert and PCS checkup reporting scenarios, respectively (compared to 16% and 60% with a baseline).},

One popular context is AI-assisted email writing, and this paper explores how AI-generated emails compare to human-written emails. We obtained human-written emails from the W3C corpus and generated analogous AI-generated emails using GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama-2, and Mistral-7B, and compared AI-generated and human-written emails using a suite of natural language analyses across syntactic, semantic, and psycholinguistic dimensions. AI-generated emails are generally consistent across different LLMs but differ significantly from human-written emails. Specifically, AI-generated emails tend to be more formal, verbose, and complex, whereas human-written emails are often more concise and personalized. While AI-generated emails are slightly more polite, both types exhibit a similar level of empathetic tone in language. Further, we qualitatively examined user perceptions of AI and human-written emails by conducting a small survey of 41 participants and interviewing a subset of them. This study highlights preliminary insights into generative AI’s distinct strengths and weaknesses in assisting email communication, and we discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the evolving landscape of AI-generated content.},

abstract = {Digital identity wallets allow users to store their digital identities and verification documents, such as ID cards or passports, in one place on their devices. However, research shows that digital identity wallets have significant user experience (UX) and information security (InfoSec) problems. Users often have difficulties understanding the functionality of digital identity wallets, leading to instances where personal information is inadequately stored or shared with untrustworthy parties. In addition, UX and InfoSec can negatively influence each other. Therefore, it is important to consider UX and InfoSec together during evaluation and improvement. In this paper, we first present a UX evaluation in which 24 test subjects tested a prototype with a digital identity wallet to exchange credentials with a mobility platform. Four prototype variants were evaluated, which differed in terms of their authentication method. The idea behind the division was to create situations where the mutual implications become visible, that is, where UX impacts InfoSec, and vice versa. We present the main UX evaluation results, which were obtained by applying the evaluation methods of thinking aloud, eye tracking and two questionnaires, in order to initially gain important UX evaluation insights of the prototype variants and the prototype as a whole. In addition, we discuss InfoSec implications derived from the UX evaluation results through discussion with experts in the field of InfoSec and usable security.},

abstract = {Phishing websites have often been used for online and email fraud, spreading unwanted content. It has been important to find them before any user data was entered. In recent years, numerous attempts have been made to identify these phishing websites. To identify phishing web pages, most current methods trained classification models using manually constructed lexical and statistical features from the textual content of websites. The time-consuming method of extracting hand-crafted features, which required specialized domain knowledge to determine which features were useful for a given platform, was one of the limitations of these phishing detection approaches. To address these issues, this project aimed to develop a website which is an Integrated Web-based Approach for Email Analysis Investigation Tool (IWAEAIT) that used an external API like Virus total to analyses phishing websites and ip-api to get the location of the email. The project's goal was to ensure that anyone could use this website to identify if an email was phishing or not, even if they had no prior IT experience. This project also included features like file attachment analysis and a feature that let users take a screenshot of the website without really visiting it to stop users from visiting phishing websites, URL scan analysis and email artefacts extractor to get the location of the email.},

Crowdsensing is a research approach that has become increasingly popular due to its ability to collect data from many individuals continuously and at scale. However, it is equally important to ensure that the data collected is of high quality, as it depends on many factors. In this paper, we discuss the data quality issues encountered during our crowdsensing study conducted from October 2022 to August 2023, which aimed at collecting data to study college students' emotions and mental wellness. We present our findings on data quality issues related to participant recruitment, device usability, data quantity, compliance, consistency, privacy concerns, and incentive mechanisms. We discuss the strategies to address these challenges and plans for future improvements. Our results and discussion highlight the effectiveness of crowdsensing in data collection for this demographic. Additionally, we identified positive and negative emotional drivers and potential stressors affecting this group's mental wellness. The insights from this work can aid the design of future crowdsensing applications and studies.},

Throughout, we find that the CISO role is strongly shaped by a business enablement perspective, driven by broad organizational goals beyond solely technical protection. Within that framing, we describe the most salient concerns for CISOs, isolate key decision-making factors they use when prioritizing security investments, and surface practical complexities and pain points that they face in executing their strategy. Our results surface opportunities to help CISOs better navigate the complex task of managing organizational risk, as well as lessons for how security tools can be made more deployable in practice.},

abstract = {Trust &amp; Safety (T&amp;S) teams have become vital parts of tech platforms; ensuring safe platform use and combating abuse, harassment, and misinformation. However, between 2021 and 2023, T&amp;S teams faced significant layoffs, impacted by broader downsizing in the tech industry. In addition, a reduction in T&amp;S teams has also been attributed to partisan pressure against content moderation efforts designed to mitigate the spread of election and COVID-19-related misinformation. Accordingly, there exist crucial questions over the future of content moderation and T&amp;S in the digital information environment, questions central to the work of CHI researchers interested in intervening in online harm through design, policy and user research. Through in-depth interviews with T&amp;S professionals, this paper explores upheavals within the T&amp;S industry, examining current perspectives of content moderation and broader strategies for maintaining safe digital environments.},

abstract = {Neighborhood safety technologies, such as Nextdoor and Citizen, aim to enhance user safety through features like real-time alerts, interactive maps, and personalized feeds. While these platforms can support users’ sense of safety, they can also fuel a local culture of policing and lateral surveillance, which disproportionately impacts racialized and unhoused members of the community. In contrast, the theory and practice of Transformative Justice was developed to ensure the safety of those populations who are constructed to be dangerous by society. We conducted a case study of a neighborhood social work program in Jackson Grove, Atlanta to understand the design implications of a Transformative Justice-oriented approach to neighborhood safety. Our findings highlight an opportunity for designers to reconceptualize safety from merely protecting users towards: 1) meeting the basic needs of a community, and 2) building relationships to support accountability. These shifts create an opportunity for designers to reimagine neighborhood safety technologies and the associated practices for users. We surface a new wave of safety research in HCI that aims to support both safety and justice and contribute key design priorities towards this work.},

To bridge this gap, we designed, built, and evaluated Rescriber, a browser extension that supports user-led data minimization in LLM-based conversational agents by helping users detect and sanitize personal information in their prompts. Our studies (N=Rescriber) showed that Rescriber helped users reduce unnecessary disclosure and addressed their privacy concerns. Users’ subjective perceptions of the system powered by Llama3-8B were on par with that by GPT-4o. The comprehensiveness and consistency of the detection and sanitization emerge as essential factors that affect users’ trust and perceived protection. Our findings confirm the viability of smaller-LLM-powered, user-facing, on-device privacy controls, presenting a promising approach to address the privacy and trust challenges of AI.},

Our findings highlight that they heavily rely on community advice and intermediation to establish and maintain security-related practices (such as passwords). We uncover how shifting social environments shape advice dissemination, e.g., across different workplaces. Participants leverage their social structures to protect each other against threats that exploit their financial vulnerability and lack of digital literacy. However, we uncover barriers to social advice mechanisms, limiting their effectiveness, which may lead to increased security and privacy risks.

We aimed to leverage users' unique neural responses during pictorial processing in PGA, in order to train individual AI models that could mitigate impersonation attacks. Additionally, our study examined how users' familiarity with background images affected the accuracy of these models. Results indicated that: a) familiar stimuli enhance cognitive efficiency and authentication accuracy; b) the combination of Wavelet features, Hjorth parameters, and spectral entropy with Support Vector Machines yielded good performance.

In product teams, designers often craft UX to meet user needs, but it is unclear how they engage with LLMs as a novel design material. Through a formative study with 12 designers, we find that designers seek a translational process that enables design requirements to shape and be shaped by LLM behavior, motivating a need for designerly adaptation to facilitate this translation. We then built Canvil, a Figma widget that operationalizes designerly adaptation. We used Canvil as a probe to study designerly adaptation in a group-based design study (6 groups, N = 17), finding that designers constructively iterated on both adaptation approaches and interface designs to enhance end-user interaction with LLMs. Furthermore, designers identified promising collaborative workflows for designerly adaptation. Our work opens new avenues for processes and tools that foreground designers’ human-centered expertise when developing LLM-powered applications.},

abstract = {Generative large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing with their transformative and emergent capabilities. However, recent evidence indicates that LLMs can produce harmful content that violates social norms, raising significant concerns regarding the safety and ethical ramifications of deploying these advanced models. Thus, it is both critical and imperative to perform a rigorous and comprehensive safety evaluation of LLMs before deployment. Despite this need, owing to the extensiveness of LLM generation space, it still lacks a unified and standardized risk taxonomy to systematically reflect the LLM content safety, as well as automated safety assessment techniques to explore the potential risks efficiently. To bridge the striking gap, we propose S-Eval, a novel LLM-based automated Safety Evaluation framework with a newly defined comprehensive risk taxonomy. S-Eval incorporates two key components, i.e., an expert testing LLM Mt and a novel safety critique LLM Mc. The expert testing LLM Mt is responsible for automatically generating test cases in accordance with the proposed risk management (including 8 risk dimensions and a total of 102 subdivided risks). The safety critique LLM Mc can provide quantitative and explainable safety evaluations for better risk awareness of LLMs. In contrast to prior works, S-Eval differs in significant ways: (i) efficient – we construct a multi-dimensional and open-ended benchmark comprising 220,000 test cases across 102 risks utilizing Mt and conduct safety evaluations for 21 influential LLMs via Mc on our benchmark. The entire process is fully automated and requires no human involvement. (ii) effective – extensive validations show S-Eval facilitates a more thorough assessment and better perception of potential LLM risks, and Mc not only accurately quantifies the risks of LLMs but also provides explainable and in-depth insights into their safety, surpassing comparable models such as LLaMA-Guard-2. (iii) adaptive – S-Eval can be flexibly configured and adapted to the rapid evolution of LLMs and accompanying new safety threats, test generation methods and safety critique methods thanks to the LLM-based architecture. We further study the impact of hyper-parameters and language environments on model safety, which may lead to promising directions for future research. S-Eval has been deployed in our industrial partner for the automated safety evaluation of multiple LLMs serving millions of users, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.},

CGR is integrated into the Microsoft Defender XDR product and deployed worldwide, generating millions of recommendations across thousands of customers. Our extensive evaluation, incorporating internal evaluation, collaboration with security experts, and customer feedback, demonstrates that CGR delivers high-quality recommendations across all three tasks. We provide a comprehensive overview of the CGR architecture, setting a precedent as the first cybersecurity company to openly discuss these capabilities in such depth. Additionally, we release GUIDE, the largest public collection of real-world security incidents, spanning 13M evidences across 1M incidents annotated with ground-truth triage labels by customer security analysts.},

In recovery, digital footprints keep survivors tethered to their trafficking experience, impacting their digital autonomy, economic mobility, and feelings of safety. Nevertheless, technology can also be a valuable tool for survivors’ recovery, connecting them to essential resources and support systems. We discuss the need for interventions and services that account for the specificity of the trafficking context to help survivors attain digital safety and autonomy, including the potential to adapt existing tech safety services designed for other contexts to human trafficking.},

abstract = {Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., erase sensitive emails or clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g., work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user confirmation such as smartphone app permissions or access control lists---while imperfect---have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However, with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.},

abstract = {Cryptocurrency adoption has surged dramatically, with over 500 million global users. Despite the appeal of self-custodial wallets, which grant users control over their assets, these users often struggle with the complexities of securing seed phrases, leading to substantial financial losses. This paper investigates the behaviors, challenges, and security practices of cryptocurrency users regarding seed phrase management. We conducted a mixed-methods study comprising semi-structured interviews with 20 participants and a comprehensive survey of 643 respondents. Our findings reveal significant gaps in users’ understanding and practices around seed phrase security and the circumstances under which users share their seed phrases. We also explore users’ mental models of shared accounts and strategies for handling cryptocurrency assets in the event of death. We found that the majority of our participants harbored significant misconceptions about seed phrases that could expose them to significant security risks — e.g., only 43% could correctly identify an image of a seed phrase, many believed they could reset their seed phrase if they lost them. Moreover, only a minority have engaged in any estate planning for their crypto assets. By identifying these challenges and behaviors, we provide actionable insights for the design of more secure and user-friendly cryptocurrency wallets, ultimately aiming to enhance user confidence in managing their crypto assets reduce their exposure to scams and accidental loss of assets, and simplify the creation of bequeathment plans.},

There is growing interest from the security behavior community in how autonomous motivators shape employees’ security-related behaviors. To reconcile the scattered viewpoints on autonomous motivation and synthesize findings from studies utilizing various theoretical frameworks, we systematically reviewed relevant publications. We present a preregistered literature review that investigated (a) what forms of autonomous motivation have been examined in organizational security contexts, (b) which behaviors/behavioral intentions are related to autonomous motivators, and (c) how autonomous motivation affects employees’ security behaviors. Based on an initial set of 432 papers, filtered down to 45 studies, we identified 17 unique autonomous motivators and three types of related security behaviors. This review not only develops a refined taxonomy of autonomous motivation related to security behaviors but also charts a path forward for future research on autonomous motivation in human-centered security.},

These issues are particularly prominent among users with chronic disease, whose needs and capabilities vary widely. To address this, Adaptive User Interfaces (AUIs) offer a dynamic solution by tailoring interface features to users’ preferences, health status, and contexts. This paper presents a two-stage study to develop and validate actionable AUI design guidelines for mHealth applications. In stage one, an AUI prototype was evaluated through focus groups, interviews, and a standalone survey, revealing key user challenges and preferences. These insights informed the creation of an initial set of guidelines. In stage two, the guidelines were refined based on feedback from 20 end users and evaluated by 43 software practitioners through two surveys. This process resulted in nine finalized guidelines. To assess real-world relevance, a case study of four mHealth applications was conducted, with findings supported by user reviews highlighting the utility of the guidelines in identifying critical adaptation issues. This study offers actionable, evidence-based guidelines that help software practitioners design AUI in mHealth to better support individuals managing chronic diseases.},

In this work, the application of software model checking and static analysis in the verification and validation of safety critical software in Ada is explored. With the embedded flight control software in the onboard computer of an aerospace system as the case study, we apply the SPIN model checker and also develop a custom tool chain based on bounded model checking, for formal static analysis of Ada code. The major contributions include the definition of a systematic procedure for model checking with SPIN tool and the development of a new verification framework for formal static analysis of Ada programs. The two approaches are applied to an actual case study through accurate modelling of the execution environment for the concurrent onboard software in a launch vehicle. The results are compared and the advantages and drawbacks of both approaches are summarized.},

ReverSim enables quantitative studies with easier-to-recruit non-experts to uncover cognitive factors relevant to HRE. We empirically evaluated ReverSim in three studies. Semi-structured interviews with 14 HRE professionals confirmed its comparability to real-world HRE processes. Two online user studies with 170 novices and intermediates revealed effective differentiation of participant performance across a spectrum of difficulties, and correlations between participants’ cognitive processing speed and task performance. ReverSim is available as open-source software, providing a robust platform for controlled experiments to assess cognitive processes in HRE, potentially opening new avenues for hardware protection.},

However, there is a lack of understanding about how emotional support is delivered through text-based systems, especially in various non-emergency contexts. In this study, we analyzed two years of chat logs comprising 57,114 messages across 8,239 incidents from 130 higher education institutions. Our empirical findings revealed significant variations in emotional support provided by dispatchers, influenced by the type of incident, service time, and a noticeable decline in support over time across multiple organizations. To improve the consistency and quality of emotional support, we developed and implemented a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM), named dispatcherLLM, designed to suggest replies through simulating human dispatchers' languages with appropriate emotional support. We evaluated dispatcherLLM by comparing its generated responses to those of human dispatchers and other off-the-shelf models using real chat messages. Additionally, we conducted a human evaluation to assess the perceived effectiveness of the support provided by dispatcherLLM. This study not only contributes new empirical understandings of emotional support in text-based dispatch systems but also demonstrates the significant potential of generative AI in improving service delivery.},

abstract = {Phishing sites exploit users’ limited understanding of website identity to mimic legitimate sites. While X.509 certificates can provide crucial cues regarding a website’s identity, current browsers fail to effectively communicate this information to users, even as phishing becomes an increasingly serious issue. To address this, we developed Site Inspector (SI), a UI tool that conveys website identity and connection encryption information, along with brief explanations of the relevant underlying security concepts. SI is implemented as a Mozilla Firefox browser extension, but the basic design could be integrated into any web browser. SI organizes content in a three-tiered abstraction hierarchy, drawing on Ecological Interface Design. The top level presents an indicator of the website owner, if known, and also whether the connection is encrypted. The second and third levels offer progressively detailed explanations of the verification process. SI adheres to design principles aimed at educating users about security through the UI while overcoming associated challenges. Its text is concise and direct, respecting limitations in users’ attentional resources and motivation to engage with security matters. As a proof of concept for SI’s principled design, we conducted a user study with 30 participants to evaluate its effectiveness in helping users differentiate real from fraudulent websites. Results suggested that SI improved users’ ability to identify fraudulent sites. Future work will involve further testing with a larger user base, integrated SI directly into browsers, and ultimately a more widespread and improved validation process for certificates, with stronger verification and transparency},

However, communication and trust issues between humans and AI often hinder effective collaboration within HATs, highlighting a need for effective human-centered team training, an area significantly understudied. To address this gap, we interviewed eSports athletes and team-based, competitive gamers (N=22), a group experienced in HATs and team training, about their HAT team training needs and desires. Through the lens of Quantitative Ethnography (QE), we analyzed their insights to understand preferred team training strategies and the desired roles of AI within these strategies, considering the varying levels of human expertise. Our findings reveal a strong preference across all expertise levels for cross-training, which is training in other teammate roles, to improve perspective taking and coordination in HATs. Less experienced participants prefer structured procedural training, while experts favor self-correction methods for growth. Additionally, participants desired that AI act as a companion, with beginners and intermediates valuing AI's functional roles, and experts seeking AI in a coaching role. Among the first to emphasize human-centered team training in HATs, this study contributes to CSCW/HCI research by revealing varied preferences for training and AI roles, emphasizing the need to tailor these aspects to team dynamics and individual skills for better outcomes in HATs.},

However, while research to date has provided insights into the opportunities and challenges of online platform use after pregnancy loss, we have a limited understanding of how users actively work to navigate these environments in order to successfully share their experiences, seek support, and protect themselves online. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a comprehensive understanding of online platform engagement after pregnancy loss, by examining how users manage their experiences and make decisions across platforms. We recruited 92 participants who had experienced pregnancy loss, through a qualitative online survey and semi-structured interviews. A reflexive thematic analysis was then conducted. Our findings demonstrate how participants actively worked to locate relevant pregnancy loss content, to share such content only with desired audiences, and to find safe online pregnancy loss spaces. However, users also struggled to manage algorithm-driven content, upsetting audience reactions, and discomfort in online pregnancy loss spaces. As these challenges could lead to emotional distress and potential re-traumatisation among this population, this raises key concerns for their safety and wellbeing online. In response to this, we discuss the implications of our study for supporting safer online platform engagement within future CSCW research and practice, specifically from the perspective of trauma-informed care.},

abstract = {The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly impacted numerous, and will impact more, real-world applications. However, these models also pose significant risks to individuals and society. To mitigate these issues and guide future model development, responsible evaluation and auditing of LLMs are essential. This workshop aims to address the current “evaluation crisis” in LLM research and practice by bringing together HCI and AI researchers and practitioners to rethink LLM evaluation and auditing from a human-centered perspective. The workshop will explore topics around understanding stakeholders’ needs and goals with evaluation and auditing LLMs, establishing human-centered evaluation and auditing methods, developing tools and resources to support these methods, building community and fostering collaboration. By soliciting papers, organizing invited keynote and panel, and facilitating group discussions, this workshop aims to develop a future research agenda for addressing the challenges in LLM evaluation and auditing. Following a successful first iteration of this workshop at CHI 2024, we introduce the theme of “mind the context” for this second iteration, where participants will be encouraged to tackle the challenges and nuances of LLM evaluation and auditing in specific contexts.},

Increasingly, there have been calls within and outside HCI for a more integrated approach to sustainable development. To identify the potential of such an approach, we present a comprehensive review of HCI scholarship on sustainability and development, combined with an analysis of interviews with researchers working in and across both subfields. Using the lens of political economy, we uncover understandings, critiques, tensions, and considerations toward advancing scholarship at the intersections of sustainability, development, and HCI. We conclude by inviting the larger Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI) community to join us in collectively devising pathways for technology-mediated sustainable development.},

This paper explores the privacy and security challenges experienced by MDWs in multi-user smart homes through in-depth semi-structured interviews with 26 MDWs and 5 staff members of agencies that recruit and/or train domestic workers in China. Our findings reveal that the relationships between MDWs, their employers, and agencies are characterized by significant power imbalances, influenced by Chinese cultural and social factors (such as Confucianism and collectivism), as well as legal ones. Furthermore, the widespread and normalized use of surveillance technologies in China, particularly in public spaces, exacerbates these power imbalances, reinforcing a sense of constant monitoring and control. Drawing on our findings, we provide recommendations to domestic worker agencies and policymakers to address the privacy and security challenges facing MDWs in Chinese smart homes.},

abstract = {Social Media Intelligence (SOCMINT) is widely used for gathering sensitive information about individuals, companies, or organizations, fueling potential attacks. This study highlights the inadequacy of current privacy protection measures and proposes an automated, sustainable approach to correlate user profiles, including homonyms and pseudonyms, solely through publicly available data. A sustainable method presents a solution to bypass API privatization and anti-scraping measures for data collection and formatting, emphasizing data correlation and the creation of cross-referenced dictionaries. Aggregated data enables indirect correlations, enhancing accuracy and relevance compared to existing methods. The purpose of this study is to create a self-learning knowledge base that addresses acronyms, homonyms, and pseudonyms while incorporating context to establish deeper connections between data. Comparisons will account for contextual relevance rather than relying solely on distances or metrics. Despite challenges posed by GDPR implementation and diminishing exploitable data, analysis of a database containing 7,600 accounts from major social platforms reveals over 90% accuracy in user-to-profile associations with 30% of homonyms and unpredictable pseudonyms or usernames. Notably, the study unveils the feasibility of retrieving information from private profiles solely through the application of dictionaries. If privacy limits on social networks, a cautionary note highlights the emphasis on the passive role of users in extensive data dissemination by governance structures and the necessity to create solutions to ensure end-to-end privacy data protection.},

Their early ideation phase requires intensive research, brainstorming, visual exploration, and combination of various design elements to form cohesive designs. However, existing AI tools focus on image generation from user specifications, lacking support for the unique needs and complexity of concept designers’ workflows. Through a formative study with 12 professional designers, we captured their workflows and identified key requirements for AI-assisted ideation tools. Leveraging these insights, we developed AIdeation to support early ideation by brainstorming design concepts with flexible searching and recombination of reference images. A user study with 16 professional designers showed that AIdeation significantly enhanced creativity, ideation efficiency, and satisfaction (all p&lt;.01) compared to current tools and workflows. A field study with 4 studios for 1 week provided insights into AIdeation’s benefits and limitations in real-world projects. After the completion of the field study, two studios, covering films, television, and games, have continued to use AIdeation in their commercial projects to date, further validating AIdeation’s improvement in ideation quality and efficiency.},

Three conditions included a manipulated ChatGPT-like AI assistant, suggesting an insecure MD5 implementation. We found a high level of trust in AI-generated code, even when insecure suggestions were presented. While security prompts, AI warnings, and guidelines improved security awareness, 32% of those notified about insecure AI recommendations still accepted weak implementation suggestions, mistakenly considering it secure and often expressing confidence in their choice.

abstract = {A classic problem in enterprise Wi-Fi is client-side misconfiguration, which enables credential theft via “Evil Twin” (ET) attacks. To mitigate this, we design, develop, and evaluate a new configurator, SeQR, which allows users to effortlessly and securely set up an enterprise Wi-Fi connection. Utilizing existing authenticated channels, SeQR fully automates the client-side enterprise Wi-Fi configuration process with a simple scan, leaving no room for misconfigurations. Specifically, SeQR thwarts ET by making it impossible for users to opt-out from the security-critical certificate validation. We evaluate the efficacy of SeQR on two fronts. First, we implement a prototype of SeQR in Android, and test its functionality and runtime performance. Next, we compare the usability of SeQR against two existing Wi-Fi configuration interfaces of Android in an in-person user study (n=41) with real devices. Our evaluation shows that SeQR achieves noticeable usability improvements over existing designs, and prevents users from misconfiguring.},

This finding raises a critical question: How can we develop AI that understands accessibility deeply enough to know when to comply and when to thoughtfully challenge established design principles? Through systematic attempts to subvert AI tools and make them follow our request, we found them both rigid and limited: capable of reproducing accessible patterns, but incapable of thoughtful deviation when context demanded it. By adopting the lens of intentional inaccessibility as an investigation method, we raise questions about the nature of design intelligence that demand reconsideration of how design knowledge is integrated into AI-driven design tools.},

From modern manufacturing involving human-robot teams, to personal care robots assisting the elderly, the roles that robots are being tasked with and the nature of interactions with humans are constantly shifting. Even the nature of interaction has changed to incorporate wearable technologies such as exoskeletons to enhance human capabilities, and advanced prosthetics to restore those abilities that have been lost. With this ever-evolving spectrum of HRI, the capacity of measurement science to evaluate, assess, and assure performance and safety struggles to keep up. Building on our previous five-workshop series on Test Methods and Metrics for Effective HRI, NIST presents a new series on evaluative methodologies for accelerating the pipeline from cutting-edge HRI research to state-of-practice. This workshop will address issues regarding 1) data collection and reporting for replicability and system validation, 2) test design and execution for performance verification, and 3) cross-modality artifact design for real-world application-adjacent technology transfer. The goal of this workshop is to accelerate and accommodate accessibility to HRI research results, and address the specific key performance indicators that would establish end-user trust and acceptance of emerging HRI technologies.},

abstract = {Digital climate actions are an important aspect in centring voices in climate activism and therefore, it is important to study how digital channels support or hinder the actions of climate activists. Specifically, due to identity-related factors, people of colour (POC) could feel marginalised and othered, making it difficult to fit in in climate communities but online anonymity might help relieve these concerns. However, little research informs us what digital platforms POC actually use for building and engaging in climate communities including social media platforms (e.g., Facebook and Instagram), instant messaging channels (e.g., WhatsApp and Telegram), microblogging (e.g., Twitter), online newsletters and petitions and how these platforms and their anonymity features support or do not support their participation. Therefore, the current mixed-methods survey study was conducted to investigate what POC's choices of digital platforms are and how anonymity features support their participation in digital climate actions including their sense of safety and belonging. The results from 264 participants of five racial backgrounds i.e., White, Black, South Asian, Central, East and South East (CESE) Asians and mixed race, showed that there were different patterns in digital platform usage where most participants of colour had more distributed platform choices than White participants who were more likely to engage on identified sites such as Facebook and petitions. We also found that POC are more likely to engage on encrypted communication channels such as Telegram and WhatsApp and some anonymous actions than White participants. Results understanding the effects of anonymity reinforced that anonymity is important for POC's engagement because of safety reasons, however, being able to identify other POC is also important to their engagement as they might feel safer, giving them more courage to engage unanonymously. POC's need for anonymity, therefore, presented a contradictory but interesting paradox. Our study contributes to highlighting the importance of pluralistic and inclusive frameworks including trauma-informed computing and intersectionality in technological design which emphasises aspects of individual safety, community and digital platform trust and community support, collaboration and intersectional needs.},

abstract = {With the increasing digitization of teaching and learning activities, technology-generated data has become the target of attacks from external adversaries and abuse by technology providers. Researchers have investigated stakeholders’ perceptions of security and privacy risks from technologies and how those risks are affecting institutional policies for acquiring new technologies. However, outside of institutional vetting and approval, there is a pervasive practice of using applications and devices acquired personally. It is unclear how these applications and devices affect the dynamics of the overall institutional ecosystem.We address this gap through an online survey-based study targeting educators and administrators from K-12 and higher education institutions in the United States. Our study identified 494 unique applications used by educators, and examined the perceived and subsequent risks associated with integrating these technologies into an institution’s ecosystem. The findings highlight a significant lack of privacy and security awareness among educators when selecting new tools, as well as widespread uncertainty regarding regulatory compliance. Additionally, institutional warnings and policies on unsanctioned app use appear to have limited effectiveness in changing educators’ behaviors. To mitigate these challenges, we identified the need for institutions to provide clear guidelines, data privacy and security training, and vetted alternatives that meet the needs of educators while ensuring compliance. A collaborative approach between educators and administrators will be key to balancing automation and data privacy.},

The framework aims to enhance the accuracy and relevance of retrieved information to produce more context-aware and actionable security recommendations, identify potential privacy risks, and detect vulnerabilities by utilizing structured knowledge about entities (e.g., access control mechanisms, security policies, privacy-preserving algorithms, protocols, software vulnerabilities) and their inter-relationships in the security context. We also extend the multimodal-LLM interpretability paradigm by contextual explanation generation for equations and tables from unstructured and highly technical documents.  KnowGen-RAG proves superior for security-related information retrieval and contextual reasoning. It significantly outperforms both the LLM's output without RAG and Baseline RAG in terms of preciseness and reliability.  Specifically, KnowGen-RAG increases accuracy for the CyberMetric dataset, where the original approach struggled to perform consistently for lightweight LLMs, and Baseline RAG achieved only marginal improvements.   Additionally, KnowGen-RAG enhances answer quality for our curated security dataset, SecMD, demonstrating its effectiveness and improved understanding of security-related techniques and digital artifacts when addressing complex questions. The system aims to strengthen the learning of security professionals by providing thorough insights into the security landscape, encouraging informed decision-making in the face of sophisticated challenges.},

abstract = {While Intelligent Connected Vehicles (ICV) improve travel convenience, they also bring new security risks, especially how to achieve data security protection for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which has become a key bottleneck restricting the development of ICV and has received widespread attention from academic and industrial circles at home and abroad. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the data security risks faced by ICV, this article conducts a comprehensive comparative study of relevant solutions at home and abroad, and proposes an ICV data security protection model framework based on Federated Learning (FL) and blockchain technology. FL is used to solve the privacy leakage risk caused by raw data sharing in traditional architecture of IoV, while differential privacy technology is used to protect model parameters, and blockchain technology is used to address risks such as single point failures in FL. This framework provides a new idea for data security protection for ICV.},

abstract = {Despite Generative AI (GenAI) systems’ potential for enhancing content creation, users often struggle to effectively integrate GenAI into their creative workflows. Core challenges include misalignment of AI-generated content with user intentions (intent elicitation and alignment), user uncertainty around how to best communicate their intents to the AI system (prompt formulation), and insufficient flexibility of AI systems to support diverse creative workflows (workflow flexibility). Motivated by these challenges, we created IntentTagger: a system for slide creation based on the notion of Intent Tags—small, atomic conceptual units that encapsulate user intent—for exploring granular and non-linear micro-prompting interactions for Human-GenAI co-creation workflows. Our user study with 12 participants provides insights into the value of flexibly expressing intent across varying levels of ambiguity, meta-intent elicitation, and the benefits and challenges of intent tag-driven workflows. We conclude by discussing the broader implications of our findings and design considerations for GenAI-supported content creation workflows.},

abstract = {Web browser extensions have become essential tools in modern browsing, offering enhanced functionality and customization. However, these extensions also introduce a new attack surface, expanding the scope for security vulnerabilities in web browsers. This paper presents Stealth Extension Exfiltration (SEE) attacks, a novel threat that exploits the mismanagement of browser extension permissions. SEE attacks enable malicious extensions to bypass security measures and perform unauthorized actions, such as sending arbitrary HTTP requests, misusing the fetch API to access local files, and exfiltrating sensitive user data without explicit user permissions. Our large-scale analysis of 57,831 real-world browser extensions reveals vulnerabilities that could potentially affect up to 351 million users. We provide concrete examples of these attacks, demonstrating how they can stealthily evade detection while compromising user privacy and security. We reported these risks to the Google security team, who acknowledged the threat posed by SEE attacks. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose mitigation strategies that include enforcing a stricter separation between host permissions and content scripts, as well as implementing more granular access control for sensitive APIs.},

Wade highlighted the need to study abortion misinformation as health-related content that could have criminal implications for users. In response to this need, we conducted a study with 60 TikTok users about the way they conceptualize, assess, and respond to misleading abortion videos. Half of our participants saw political intent behind the spread of health-related misinformation driven towards a “fear of criminalization.” Prior to Roe v. Wade, our participants encountered videos discussing the legal ramifications of abortion, but post-Roe v. Wade, they saw videos suggesting herbal alternative treatments for pregnancy termination. Roughly 30% of our participants believed in the safety and efficacy of these otherwise scientifically debunked “alternative abortion treatments,” even in the presence of a debunking label attached to a self-administering abortion video.},

To address this, we present Satori, a novel AR system that proactively guides users by modeling both – their mental states and environmental contexts. Satori integrates the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) framework with the state-of-the-art multi-modal large language model (LLM) to deliver contextually appropriate guidance. Our system is designed based on two formative studies involving twelve experts. We evaluated the system with a sixteen within-subject study and found that Satori matches the performance of designer-created Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) systems, without manual configurations or heuristics, thereby improving generalizability, reusability, and expanding the potential of AR assistance.

abstract = {Browser fingerprinting is a pervasive online tracking technique used increasingly often for profiling and targeted advertising. Prior research on the prevalence of fingerprinting heavily relied on automated web crawls, which inherently struggle to replicate the nuances of human-computer interactions. This raises concerns about the accuracy of current understandings of real-world fingerprinting deployments. As a result, this paper presents a user study involving 30 participants over 10 weeks, capturing telemetry data from real browsing sessions across 3,000 top-ranked websites. Our evaluation reveals that automated crawls miss almost half (45%) of the fingerprinting websites encountered by real users. This discrepancy mainly stems from the crawlers' inability to access authentication-protected pages, circumvent bot detection, and trigger fingerprinting scripts activated by specific user interactions. We also identify potential new fingerprinting vectors present in real user data but absent from automated crawls. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of federated learning for training browser fingerprinting detection models on real user data, yielding improved performance than models trained solely on automated crawl data.},

We propose and implement a human-centered AI framework to align human and technological requirements and constraints that can guide design of intelligent systems for personal health. We use concepts from a machine learning technique, reinforcement learning, to elicit user needs, through directed content analysis of user interviews, and uncover practical data constraints, through analysis of “in the wild” user engagement logs from a self-monitoring app. We gather and triangulate human-machine-data requirements for a self-management tool for individuals with endometriosis — a poorly understood, complex chronic condition with no reliable treatment. We present recommendations for developing a system that aligns with needs, capabilities, and constraints from human user, data, and machine learning perspectives.},

abstract = {Docker has transformed modern software development, enabling the widespread reuse of containerized applications. Currently, Docker images are primarily distributed through centralized registries, among which Docker Hub is the largest, allowing developers to share and reuse images easily. The threats within these images also spread through the supply chain via dependency relationships, posing risks to anyone using the image and all images built based on it. However, it is unclear to what extent the threats within Docker images are distributed and propagated. In this paper, we investigate five potential security risks in Docker images and propose a security analysis framework DITector based on these security issues. We then utilize DITector to conduct a large-scale security measurement of the Docker image ecosystem. We collect descriptions of over 12 million image repositories from Docker Hub, construct an image dependency graph based on the layer information of the images, and select two sets of influential images based on their pull counts and dependency weight, totaling 33,952 images. Our findings are alarming: 93.7% of analyzed images contain known vulnerabilities, 4,437 images have secret leaks, 50 images contain misconfigurations and 24 malicious images. Furthermore, we identify 334 downstream images affected by malicious images and uncover patterns of attack propagation within the supply chain. We have discussed the measures to mitigate these issues, reported our findings to the relevant parties, and received positive responses.},

abstract = {This work investigates how to monitor access to Android zero-permission sensors which could cause privacy leakage to users. Moreover, monitoring such sensitive access allows security researchers to characterize potential sensor abuse patterns. Zero-permission sensors such as accelerometers have become an indispensable part of Android devices. The critical information they provide has attracted extensive research investigating how data collectors could capture more sensor data to enable both benign and exploitative applications. In contrast, little work has explored how to enable data providers, such as end users, to understand sensor usage. While existing methods such as static analysis and hooking-based dynamic analysis face challenges of requiring complicated development chains, rooting privilege, and app-specific reverse engineering analysis, our work aims to bridge this gap by developing ARMOUR for user-space runtime monitoring, leveraging the intrinsic sampling rate variation and convergence behaviors of Android. ARMOUR enables privacy-aware users to easily monitor how third-party apps use sensor data and support security researchers to perform rapid app-agnostic sensor access analysis. Our evaluation with 1,448 commercial applications shows the effectiveness of ARMOUR in detecting sensor usage in obfuscated code and other conditions, and observes salient sensor abuse patterns such as 50% of apps from seemingly sensor-independent categories accessing data of multiple zero-permission sensors. We analyze the impact of Android's recent policy changes on zero-permission sensors and remaining technical and regulatory problems.},

abstract = {Public records laws are standard for state and federal governments across the U.S. Such laws rest on the core notion that transparency, enacted through access to governmental documentation, will ensure accountability and minimize governmental corruption. However, these laws can also be exploited to harass or burden government employees, including researchers at public universities. CSCW researchers have both an acute vulnerability to these requests, e.g., due to increasing politicization of topics core to our research agenda, and a unique opportunity to study challenges around public records requests as they intersect with the design and use of collaboration technologies. In this paper, we explore how a large number of public records requests (PRRs) affected the collaborative work of a large, multi-site academic research project. We find that — though participants believed PRRs were a valuable tool for government transparency — they added a complicated new dimension to distributed "work" which blends personal and professional dimensions. We explain how researchers interpreted these requests and adapted their communication techniques in response. We discuss how current technologies for communication and collaboration are unprepared to ensure personal privacy and security within adversarial research environments — and collaborative work environments more broadly. Finally, we highlight the misalignment between long-standing transparency laws and the current design of collaboration technologies and provide recommendations for updating these laws.},

abstract = {Large Language Model (LLM) is changing the software development paradigm and has gained huge attention from both academia and industry. Researchers and developers collaboratively explore how to leverage the powerful problem-solving ability of LLMs for specific domain tasks. Due to the wide usage of LLM-based applications, e.g., ChatGPT, multiple works have been proposed to ensure the security of LLM systems. A comprehensive understanding of the entire process of LLM system construction (the LLM supply chain) is crucial, but relevant works are limited. More importantly, the security issues hidden in the LLM SC that could greatly impact the reliable usage of LLMs lack exploration. Most existing works mainly focus on assuring the quality of LLM from the model level; however, security assurance for the entire LLM SC is ignored. In this work, we take the first step to discuss the potential security risks in each component and the integration between components of LLM SC. We summarize 12 security-related risks and provide promising guidance to help build safer LLM systems. We hope our work can facilitate the evolution of artificial general intelligence with secure LLM ecosystems.},

abstract = {Dark patterns (DPs) refer to unethical user interface designs that deceive users into making unintended decisions, compromising their privacy, safety, financial security, and more. Prior research has mainly focused on defining and classifying DPs, as well as assessing their impact on users, while legislative and technical efforts to mitigate them remain limited. Consequently, users are still exposed to DP risks, making it urgent to educate them on avoiding these harms. However, there has been little focus on developing educational interventions for DP awareness. This study addresses this gap by introducing DPTrek, an experiential learning (EL) platform that educates users through simulated real-world DP cases. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations show the effectiveness of DPTrek in helping users identify and manage DPs. The study also offers insights for future DP education and research, highlighting challenges such as user-unfriendly taxonomies and the lack of practical mitigation solutions.},

In this paper, we present the first systematic study of the architecture and security policies of in-flight Wi-Fi paywall systems using network tomography analysis. We discover that attackers can exploit the inherent architectural shortcomings of airborne networks to create covert channels and conceal data packets within certain ''always-allowed'' traffic for free Internet access. Moreover, broken device authentication policies in these systems allow unlimited complimentary Internet connectivity. Finally, insecure ARP policies allow attackers to steal paid users' bandwidth to access the free Internet even faster. We validate these issues in practice over two major in-flight Wi-Fi providers using common protocols, e.g., UDP, DNS, etc. We also find that the root causes of these issues stem from different design choices in the architectures of these systems and propose countermeasures to address these flaws and prevent similar attacks.},

Outdated security measures contribute to vulnerabilities, commercial losses, reputational damage, and legal consequences for healthcare institutions. To mitigate these crucial security concerns, there is a growing need to integrate advanced technologies like AI into hospital security systems. Keeping this in mind, in this paper, we propose a novel system based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure security in Bangladeshi hospitals. Since traditional methods like guards and paper records are insufficient, the integration of advanced technologies like AI and RBAC offers a solution to hospital security systems by enhancing the monitoring and threat detection capabilities. Specifically, we introduce a constrained RBAC model that limits access to authorized personnel ensuring patient data privacy. Besides, we examine the security challenges faced by the hospitals and the probable risks such as unauthorized access, child abduction, and potential data breaches. Furthermore, our proposed system achieves 91% precision and 85% accuracy in the identification of authorized personnel, which validates the correctness and effectiveness of the model.},

Nevertheless, AIGC models encounter external and internal obstacles in security, privacy, and ethics during every level of their development. To conduct a thorough analysis and investigation of risks and threats, we propose a new taxonomy system that categorizes the issues based on three primary factors: the stage of threat exposure, the specific area of the concerns, and the origin of the threats. Furthermore, we present specific unresolved questions that prompt additional investigation into the risks posed by AIGC and the steps taken to counteract them in Metaverse art creation and interactive methodologies.

Such prioritization requires project-specific knowledge, such as quality requirements, security-related decisions, and design, which is not accessible to code analyzers. We present TraceSEC, an automated technique for prioritizing issues according to their security-related importance to the project. Its core concept is to incorporate available design artifacts and trace links between them, thus considering the project context that the code lacks. We reduce the problem of issue prioritization to a maximum flow problem and quantify the importance of each issue by the flow from user-defined quality aspects to the issue, i.e., quantifying its impact on project-specific security preferences. Our evaluation shows that TraceSEC effectively provides automated prioritization and can be tailored to project-specific quality goals. Its prioritization correlates stronger with manual expert prioritization than SonarQube rule severities, which are commonly used in practice. In particular, TraceSEC has a higher similarity for identifying high-priority issues. TraceSEC scales reasonably well for codebases up to 4&nbsp;million lines of code, and the initial setup overhead is likely to be recouped after the first automated prioritization.},

While online services offer convenience in daily living, users often receive a large number of spams as a result. While previous studies have linked spam receipt primarily to user behavior, this research proposes that spam can serve as a forensic indicator of data leaks by websites. To test our hypothesis, we conducted an experiment to deploy 148 honeypots across 370 websites spanning 12 communities. We monitored and audited the spams received by our honeypots for 47 weeks and analyzed their nature, pattern and origin. The results reveal that some legitimate websites leak user data despite having privacy policy statements. The findings also highlight that some websites automatically enroll users in newsletters or mailing lists without asking consent during the sign-up. This issue arises from conflating privacy policies with spam subscription and third party share agreements. To address these issues we suggest that regulators enforce websites to separate subscription agreement from privacy policy statements, and direct consent for third party share be requested at sign up. Also, websites should evaluate third party chain to ensure user data protection.},

Industrial textile fabrication views plants as passive resources. They are grown, harvested, and spun into yarns for textile production, mainly to serve human needs. While efficient, this approach overlooks the intrinsic value of these organisms as living beings. LivingLoom fabrication approach wet-spins biodegradable yarns with seeds that can be further integrated into textiles that can sprout and grow. We present a design space for incorporating microgreen seeds into textiles with a 10-day growth cycle, leveraging care-based fabrication and interaction. We conducted a three-day user study to understand how people wear and care for plant-integrated textiles, revealing new possibilities for living textiles and care-based interactions. LivingLoom examines the intimacy between humans and plants in textile forms, shedding light on the design potential for the care-based fabrication of (e-)textiles.},

year = {2025},
publisher = {AAAI Press},
abstract = {Large language model (LLM) platforms, such as ChatGPT, have recently begun offering an app ecosystem to interface with third-party services on the internet. While these apps extend the capabilities of LLM platforms, they are developed by arbitrary third parties and thus cannot be implicitly trusted. Apps also interface with LLM platforms and users using natural language, which can have imprecise interpretations. In this paper, we propose a framework that lays a foundation for LLM platform designers to analyze and improve the security, privacy, and safety of current and future third-party integrated LLM platforms. Our framework is a formulation of an attack taxonomy that is developed by iteratively exploring how LLM platform stakeholders could leverage their capabilities and responsibilities to mount attacks against each other. As part of our iterative process, we apply our framework in the context of OpenAI's plugin (apps) ecosystem. We uncover plugins that concretely demonstrate the potential for the types of issues that we outline in our attack taxonomy. We conclude by discussing novel challenges and by providing recommendations to improve the security, privacy, and safety of present and future LLM-based computing platforms.

We aim to address this inconsistency and investigate how social media user perceptions and behaviors change once exposed to these models. We conducted user studies (N=21) and found that participants were unaware to both what the models output and when the models were used in Instagram and TikTok, two major social media platforms. In response to being exposed to the models’ functionality, we observed long term behavior changes in 8 participants.

We also interviewed 2 young adults who volunteered as mentors of some of our teen participants. We present our findings about the benefits, motivations, and risks of teen-led online communities, as well as the role of external stakeholders of these youth spaces. We contextualize our work within the broader teen online safety landscape to provide recommendations to better support, encourage, and protect teen moderators and their online communities. This empirical work contributes one of the first studies to date with teen Discord moderators and aims to empower safe youth-led online communities.},

abstract = {Parenting brings emotional and physical challenges, from balancing work, childcare, and finances to coping with exhaustion and limited personal time. Yet, one in three parents never seek support. AI systems potentially offer stigma-free, accessible, and affordable solutions. Yet, user adoption often fails due to issues with explainability and reliability. To see if these issues could be solved using a co-design approach, we developed and tested NurtureBot, a wellbeing support assistant for new parents. 32 parents co-designed the system through Asynchronous Remote Communities method, identifying the key challenge as achieving a “successful chat.” As part of co-design, parents role-played as NurtureBot, rewriting its dialogues to improve user understanding, control, and outcomes. The refined prototype, featuring an Interaction Layer, was evaluated by 32 initial and 46 new parents, showing improved user experience and usability, with final CUQ score of 91.3/100, demonstrating successful interaction patterns. Our process revealed useful interaction design lessons for effective AI parenting support.},

Therefore, various MR applications operating in pass-through devices emerged in diverse domains, such as education and healthcare. However, research on the everyday use of pass-through devices remains limited, despite it blending real and virtual environments. This study explores the user experience of pass-through devices in people’s daily tasks. We conducted a field study with 16 participants and analyzed data from eight daily tasks. For in-depth analysis, we employed three measures in terms of quantitative, qualitative, and bio-signal. As a result, we found that participants felt differently in terms of immersion, collision anxiety, and workload. Findings suggest that pass-through devices are not yet fully ready for integration into daily life. However, the potential for widespread adoption exists as the technology continues to advance. Finally, we offer guidelines and considerations to improve the usability of pass-through devices for everyday use.},

abstract = {Phishing attacks pose a significant threat to Internet users. Understanding the security posture of phishing infrastructure is crucial for developing effective defense strategies, as it helps identify potential weaknesses that attackers might exploit. Despite extensive research, there may still be a gap in fully understanding these security weaknesses. To address this important issue, this paper presents a longitudinal study of security configurations and vulnerabilities in phishing websites and associated kits. We focus on two main areas: (1) analyzing the security configurations of phishing websites and servers, particularly HTTP headers and application-level security, and (2) examining the prevalence and types of vulnerabilities in phishing kits. We analyze data from 906,731 distinct phishing websites collected over 2.5 years, covering HTML headers, client-side resources, and phishing kits. Our findings suggest that phishing websites often employ weak security configurations, with 88.8% of the 13,344 collected phishing kits containing at least one potential vulnerability, and 12.5% containing backdoor vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities present an opportunity for defenders to shift from passive defense to active disruption of phishing operations. Our research proposes a new approach to leverage weaknesses in phishing infrastructure, allowing defenders to take proactive actions to disable phishing sites earlier and reduce their effectiveness.},

abstract = {Stigma around mental health significantly hinders help-seeking behavior among university students, especially international students and those of Asian heritage. Digital storytelling can address this stigma by allowing individuals to share personal experiences, dispel negative attitudes, and foster community. However, current platforms often miss opportunities to engage users actively and supportively. To address this, we designed and implemented Digital Human Library (DHL), a story-sharing platform prototype, through brainstorming sessions with HCI researchers and a mental health nurse. We conducted a week-long diary study and semi-structured interviews with 16 university students to assess DHL's impact on self-efficacy toward seeking mental health help. Thematic analysis revealed that trust in professionals' and peers' stories can enhance self-efficacy but may be hindered if stories lack rich contextual details. DHL's support for gradual engagement helps users overcome initial reservations about seeking professional help and effectively helps them to think about future next steps, including becoming the storyteller themselves. This study highlights the potential for DHL to support mental health storytelling and suggests design implications for future HCI and CSCW research, emphasizing the importance of integrating supportive and engaging elements in digital platforms.},

abstract = {Government investigatory and surveillance powers are important tools for examining crime and protecting public safety. However, since these tools must be employed in secret, it can be challenging to identify abuses or changes in use that could be of significant public interest. In this paper, we evaluate this phenomenon in the context of National Security Letters (NSLs). NSLs are a form of legal process that empowers parts of the United States federal government to request certain pieces of information for national security purposes. After initial concerns about the lack of public oversight, Congress worked to increase transparency by mandating government agencies to publish aggregated statistics on the NSL usage and by allowing the private sector to report information on NSLs in transparency reports. The implicit goal is that these transparency mechanisms should deter large-scale abuse by making it visible. We evaluate how well these mechanisms work by carefully analyzing the full range of publicly available data related to NSL use. Our findings suggest that they may not lead to the desired public scrutiny as we find published information requires significant manual effort to collect and parse data due to the lack of structure and context. Moreover, we discovered mistakes (subsequently fixed after our reporting to the ODNI), which suggests a lack of active auditing. Taken together, our case study of NSLs provides insights and suggestions for the successful construction of transparency mechanisms that enable effective public auditing.},

abstract = {Phishing is one of the most prolific cybercriminal activities, with attacks becoming increasingly sophisticated. It is, therefore, imperative to explore novel technologies to improve user protection across both technical and human dimensions. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant promise for text processing in various domains, but their use for defense against phishing attacks still remains scarcely explored. In this paper, we present APOLLO, a tool based on OpenAI’s GPT-4o to detect phishing emails and generate explanation messages to users about why a specific email is dangerous, thus improving their decision-making capabilities. We have evaluated the performance of APOLLO in classifying phishing emails; the results show that GPT-4o has exemplary capabilities in classifying phishing emails (97% accuracy) and that this performance can be further improved by integrating data from third-party services, resulting in a near-perfect classification rate (99% accuracy). To assess the perception of the explanations generated by this tool, we also conducted a study with 20 participants, comparing four different explanations presented as phishing warnings. We compared the LLM-generated explanations to four baselines: a manually crafted warning, and warnings from Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers. The results show that not only the LLM-generated explanations were perceived as high quality, but also that they can be more understandable, interesting, and trustworthy than the baselines. These findings suggest that using LLMs as a defense against phishing is a very promising approach, with APOLLO representing a proof of concept in this research direction.},

abstract = {Harm reporting in Artificial Intelligence (AI) currently lacks a structured process for disclosing and addressing algorithmic flaws, relying largely on an ad-hoc approach. This contrasts sharply with the well-established Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) ecosystem in software security. While global efforts to establish frameworks for AI transparency and collaboration are underway, the unique challenges presented by machine learning (ML) models demand a specialized approach. To address this gap, we propose implementing a Coordinated Flaw Disclosure (CFD) framework tailored to the complexities of ML and AI issues. This paper reviews the evolution of ML disclosure practices, from ad hoc reporting to emerging participatory auditing methods, and compares them with cybersecurity norms. Our framework introduces innovations such as extended model cards, dynamic scope expansion, an independent adjudication panel, and an automated verification process. We also outline a forthcoming real-world pilot of CFD. We argue that CFD could significantly enhance public trust in AI systems. By balancing organizational and community interests, CFD aims to improve AI accountability in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.},

abstract = {Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) applications are becoming increasingly popular in research, especially as they are being used on remote edge devices and Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems. However, these devices often have very limited hardware capabilities, which makes it challenging to run large-scale model training and testing processes efficiently. Moreover, moving and managing different HRI tasks across varied devices creates significant delays and performance issues, ultimately restricting the ability of these systems to interact effectively. In this paper, we introduce a new lightweight platform named HR-D, which is designed to quickly set up and smoothly transfer HRI applications in distributed, federated environments. HR-D uses a container-based, peer-to-peer (P2P) network structure supported by a Distributed Hash Table (DHT), enabling it to scale efficiently and support anywhere from a few dozen to hundreds of thousands of clients across different applications. By incorporating warm-start containers, our platform ensures that containers or clients can be moved or started quickly to meet the real-time needs of specific HRI tasks. Additionally, HR-D offers flexible group management, which helps maintain high resource availability and adaptability on both edge and IoT devices, making it suitable for HRI applications of any size.},

abstract = {Urban environments pose significant challenges to pedestrian safety and mobility. This paper introduces a novel modular sensing framework for developing real-time, multimodal streetscape applications in smart cities. Prior urban sensing systems predominantly rely either on fixed data modalities or centralized data processing, resulting in limited flexibility, high latency, and superficial privacy protections. In contrast, our framework integrates diverse sensing modalities, including cameras, mobile IMU sensors, and wearables into a unified ecosystem leveraging edge-driven distributed analytics. The proposed modular architecture, supported by standardized APIs and message-driven communication, enables hyper-local sensing and scalable development of responsive pedestrian applications. A concrete application demonstrating multimodal pedestrian tracking is developed and evaluated. It is based on the cross-modal inference module, which fuses visual and mobile IMU sensor data to associate detected entities in the camera domain with their corresponding mobile device. We evaluate our framework's performance in various urban sensing scenarios, demonstrating an online association accuracy of 75% with a latency of ≈39 milliseconds. Our results demonstrate significant potential for broader pedestrian safety and mobility scenarios in smart cities.},

Through focus group studies with nine older adults, we found that participants’ desired level of automation varied significantly based on task characteristics and complexity. Based on these insights, we developed a classification framework categorizing features by preferred interaction approaches: full delegation, direct control, and collaborative completion, leading to design recommendations for balancing system capabilities with user agency in AI-assisted health information tools.},

abstract = {LLM-based applications are helping people write, and LLM-generated text is making its way into social media, journalism, and our classrooms. However, the differences between LLM-generated and human-written text remain unclear. To explore this, we hired professional writers to edit paragraphs in several creative domains. We first found these writers agree on undesirable idiosyncrasies in LLM-generated text, formalizing it into a seven-category taxonomy (e.g. clich\'{e}s, unnecessary exposition). Second, we curated the LAMP corpus: 1,057 LLM-generated paragraphs edited by professional writers according to our taxonomy. Analysis of LAMP reveals that none of the LLMs used in our study (GPT4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Llama-3.1-70b) outperform each other in terms of writing quality, revealing common limitations across model families. Third, building on existing work in automatic editing we evaluated methods to improve LLM-generated text. A large-scale preference annotation confirms that although experts largely prefer text edited by other experts, automatic editing methods show promise in improving alignment between LLM-generated and human-written text.},

Recognising this paradigm shift, design educators are increasingly aware of the need to prepare students for effectively engaging with emerging robotic technologies and shaping future human-robot collaboration (HRC) projects. However, systematic and structured resources to guide these student designers in approaching, conceptualising, prototyping and implementing HRC remain scarce. This paper introduces a novel HRC design toolkit tailored for student designers that incorporates industrial constraints, role assignment, and guided communication into a step-by-step design process. Evaluations with 13 student interaction designers showed that the proposed toolkit clarified task flows, facilitated more intuitive robot behaviours, and bridged the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical implementations. Based on participants’ feedback, we improved the toolkit with simpler visual aids and improved guidance, further lowering the threshold for creating collaborative tasks. Finally, we discussed the applications and contributions of this revised design toolkit to industrial robotics education.},

NEREIDA (the Spanish acronym for fast neutrons for the exploitation of facilities with atomic devices) is being developed for providing a robust solution. Utilizing Geant4-based Monte Carlo methods, NEREIDA characterizes neutron flux spectra and calculates dosimetric quantities such as environmental and personal dose equivalents in any neutron-production facility. This innovative tool integrates state-of-the-art codes for neutron transport, interaction, moderation, and material activation. Our preliminary results, obtained after the first year of a three-year development period, demonstrate computational scalability across various high-performance computing clusters and clouds. NEREIDA will generate the Geant4 facility's models from CAD files, structural materials, and neutron source characteristics without requiring programming expertise. Additionally, NEREIDA models the impact of the cosmic ray background and includes anthropomorphic phantoms for comprehensive safety assessments. This work discusses NEREIDA's current status and future directions, emphasizing its critical role in enhancing nuclear facility safety.},

abstract = {As services move online, the number of password-protected accounts grows, and thus potentially the number of passwords users need, which should all be unique and strong. Single Sign-On (SSO) provides a secure alternative authentication method, but research has shown that users have security concerns about this method and over-estimate the amount of information which it passes between online services. However, much of that research is a decade old. This study investigated the use of passwords and contrast that with the use of SSO and understanding of and attitudes to SSO, using an online questionnaire with 98 UK participants. It found that participants have many password-protected accounts (median 30) and log into them on average 8 times a day. But their password habits are insecure in a number of ways, they do not sign out of online accounts regularly and re-use passwords either exactly or with small changes. Three-quarters of participants use SSO, for a range of online account types, banking being the only exception. Users of SSO find it easy and quick, and it relieves the burden of remembering and entering passwords. However, both users and non-users of SSO rate it as moderately high risk and have numerous security concerns about it. They also appear to have poor mental models of how it works and over-estimate what information from their account is shared. These results suggest that users need more information and education about the security of passwords and SSO.},

Personalised training offers huge potential to more closely align training content with individuals’ needs and skill levels. In an online study, we assigned N=342 participants to personalised training or a random training variant to compare their effectiveness. The personalisation was based on a phishing proficiency score calculated from factors such as detection ability, knowledge, and security attitude. After training, the participants demonstrated greater proficiency, with an increased ability to detect phishing emails and higher security attitudes. These effects were most pronounced in the personalised condition, demonstrating the potential of personalisation to improve training outcomes. Overall, personalised training levelled the playing field, efficiently bringing all groups, regardless of their initial proficiency, to a comparable and desired post-training phishing proficiency level. Finally, we derived recommendations for designing personalised phishing training content and assigning users to suitable training programmes.},

abstract = {Providing accurate and actionable advice about phishing emails is challenging. The majority of advice is generic and hard to implement. Phishing emails that pass through filters and land in user inboxes are usually sophisticated and exploit differences between how humans and computers interpret emails. Therefore, users need accurate and relevant guidance to take the right action. This study investigates the effectiveness of guidance based on features extracted from emails, which even in AI-driven systems can sometimes be inaccurate, leading to poor advice. We examined three conditions: control (generic advice), perfect advice, and realistic advice, through an online survey of 489 participants on Prolific, and measured user accuracy and confidence in phishing detection with and without guidance. Our findings indicate that having advice specific to the email is more effective than generic guidance (control). Inaccuracies in the guidance can also impact user decisions and reduce detection accuracy.},

The methodology includes a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), an adapted Gray Literature Review (GLR), privacy requirement formulation, and validation via a survey. Based on the SLR and GLR, eight privacy requirements are proposed, covering personal information protection, user authentication, access control, secure communication, database safety, user rights empowerment, decentralized storage, and reliable infrastructure. Survey results highlight foundational measures like secure communication and scalable infrastructures as priorities, while advanced measures such as decentralized storage or privacy rights implementation scored lower due to complexity and cost. Practitioners also stressed clarity and verifiability, citing gaps in definitions, examples, and validation criteria as challenges to adoption.},

The simulation model is applied to real-world data from NXP Semiconductors N.V. to assess the need for safety stock at the die bank during market up- and downswings, respectively. To model demand uncertainty, we use future forecasts and adjust them by sampling from discrete distributions of historical forecast errors. For modeling supply, we propose an aggregated simulation model of the back-end supply chain and assume a front-end process that produces to forecast (Make To Stock) with the addition of safety stock. We conclude from experiments that during market up- or downswings, the impact of safety stock target levels on supply chain performance differs significantly. The proposed method allows supply chain managers to assess the impact of safety stock target levels on key performance indicators.},

MarCHIr automatically compiles web prototypes and analyses them at the pixel level to assess designs using foundational Gestalt visual principles. While computer science student assessments are often personalised with permutations of numbers, we use random assignment of colours to personalise creative prototype assignments at the scale of hundreds of students. Finally, MarCHIr integrates industry accessibility checks to HCI student assessment. We share two years of case study data across two cohorts of university students and reflect on implications for the use of automated assessment within HCI tertiary education.},

ChatGPT users compared to Google users were faster and more likely to find the correct answers. Nevertheless, participants expressed a subjective preference for Google, with ChatGPT preference more strongly dependent on users’ personality profiles. Importantly, ChatGPT users relied significantly less on primary web sources, suggesting it is more often seen as a one-stop solution rather than a connective hub for information retrieval. These findings provide key insights into the transformative effects of generative AI on everyday search, highlighting both its benefits and challenges for user interaction and trust.},

abstract = {In the ever-evolving information technology landscape, the Internet of Things (IoT) is a groundbreaking concept that bridges the physical and digital worlds. It is the backbone of an increasingly sophisticated interactive environment, yet it is a subject of intricate security challenges spawned by its multifaceted manifestations. Central to securing IoT infrastructures is the crucial aspect of authentication, necessitating a comprehensive examination of its nuances, including benefits, challenges, opportunities, trends, and societal implications. In this article, we thoroughly review the IoT authentication protocols (Aps), addressing the main challenges such as privacy protection, scalability, and human factors that may impact security. Through exacting analysis, we evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of existing APs and conduct a comparative performance analysis to evaluate their effectiveness and scalability in securing IoT environments and devices. At the end of this study, we summarize the main findings and suggest ways to improve the security of IoT devices in the future.},

abstract = {With the ever-growing threat of school shootings, modeling these tragedies is crucial to mitigate or reduce casualties in future events. However, agent-based models traditionally instruct agents to act based on theoretical behavior rather than actual human behavior. We present the results of 81,000 simulations of a school shooting where agent behavior is modeled after actual human behavior from a similar virtual scenario. Agents' reaction time and movement speed are drawn from probability distributions based on human data. The pathways assigned to agents are based on the human behavior exhibited in response to three social influence conditions: where the non-player characters all ran, all hid, or both ran and hid. Additionally, we manipulate law enforcement dispatch time, shooter accuracy, and magazine capacity. Results show mixed agent behavior and lower dispatch times had the largest influence on casualties. The methodology demonstrates the power of empirically defining agent behavior in ABMs.},

abstract = {The start of the 2020s ushered in a new era of Artificial Intelligence through the rise of Generative AI Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Chat-GPT. These AI chatbots offer a form of interactive agency by enabling users to ask questions and query for more information. However, prior research only considers if LLMs have a political bias or agenda, and not how a biased LLM can impact a user's opinion and trust. Our study bridges this gap by investigating a scenario where users read online news articles and then engage with an interactive AI chatbot, where both the news and the AI are biased to hold a particular stance on a news topic. Interestingly, participants were far more likely to adopt the narrative of a biased chatbot over news articles with an opposing stance. Participants were also substantially more inclined to adopt the chatbot's narrative if its stance aligned with the news—all compared to a control news-article only group. Our findings suggest that the very interactive agency offered by an AI chatbot significantly enhances its perceived trust and persuasive ability compared to the ‘static’ articles from established news outlets, raising concerns about the potential for AI-driven indoctrination. We outline the reasons behind this phenomenon and conclude with the implications of biased LLMs for HCI research, as well as the risks of Generative AI undermining democratic integrity through AI-driven Information Warfare.},

abstract = {The proliferation of language models has marked a significant advancement in technology and industry in recent years. The training of these models largely involves human feedback, a procedure that faces challenges including intensive resource demands and subjective human preferences. In this work, we incorporate feedback provided by artificial intelligence (AI) models instead of relying entirely on human feedback. We propose a simulation optimization framework to train the language model. The objective function for training is approximated using feedback from both human and AI models. We employ the method of control variate to reduce the variance of the approximated objective function. Additionally, we provide a procedure for deciding the sample size to acquire preferences from both human and AI models. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed procedure enhances the performance of the language model.},

This study examines how information disclosure and perceived control over information in SVR are influenced by 1) boundary permeability (e.g., interruptions from an unknown external user) and 2) identifiability of one’s conversation partner (e.g., access to their offline profile). We also explore how different social presence perceptions and privacy concerns may mediate these relationships. Comparing the experiences of participants (n = 94) randomly assigned to four different mock interview scenarios, we find the perceived actorhood of one’s conversation partner mediated the positive relationship between offline profile access and disclosure. Additionally, more permeable environmental boundaries led to significantly lower levels of disclosure. Qualitative responses emphasized SVR’s limitations in saliently conveying nonverbal expressions. Implications for future research and the design of SVR as a viable communication medium are discussed.},

However, just as a 16-wheel truck’s brakes are different from that of a standard hatchback, AI models too may need distinct analyses based on their risk, size, application domain, and other factors. Prior research has attempted to do this, by identifying areas of concern for AI/ML applications and tools needed to simulate the effect of adversarial actors. However, currently, a variety of frameworks exist which poses challenges due to inconsistent terminology, focus, complexity, and interoperability issues, hindering effective threat discovery. In this article, we present a meta-analysis of 14 AI threat modeling frameworks, providing a streamlined set of questions for AI/ML threat analysis. We then review this library, incorporating feedback from 10 experts to refine the questions. This refined set of questions allow practitioners to seamlessly integrate threat analysis for comprehensive manual evaluation of a wide range of AI/ML applications.},

Thematic analysis of the narratives, combined with quantitative survey data, reveals that stories significantly impact trust and willingness to use and adopt IoT devices. Negative stories, particularly those concerning security, privacy, and device unreliability, reduced trust and usage, while positive stories about home safety through monitoring and improved quality of life increased interest in IoT devices. Perceptions of different IoT devices varied based on the themes associated with the stories. The findings highlight the powerful role of storytelling in driving consumer acceptance of technology.},

However, these documents often contain sensitive information, and the security mechanisms governing access control in GPTs remains an underexplored area.In this work, we present the first comprehensive study on file knowledge leakage within GPTs. We develop GPTs-Filtor, leveraging the unique characteristics of GPTs deployment, to perform an in-depth analysis and detection of file knowledge leakage at both user interaction (i.e., prompt) and network transmission levels. Applying GPTs-Filtor to 8,000 popular GPTs across eight different categories, we reveal widespread vulnerabilities in the current GPTs development and deployment model. We detect 618 cases of leakage among 1,331 GPTs that involve uploaded file knowledge, leading to the exfiltration of 3,645 file contents that contain highly-sensitive data such as internal bank audit transaction records. Our work underscores the pressing need for improved security practices in GPTs development and deployment, providing crucial insights for the secure development of this young but rapidly evolving ecosystem.},

However, many OAs rely on the support of close others (COs) to complete banking activities with them. This support is mostly provided through “unofficial” mechanisms such as sharing online banking credentials, which risk an OA's privacy and security. This paper replicates a Canadian study with OAs in a UK context and extends it with co-design workshops focused on novel banking solutions for OAs and COs, helping to formalise the role of unofficial proxies within online platforms. Results show that unofficial proxy banking also occurs with COs in a UK context and co-design reveals barriers to OAs’ use of banking technology independently. We discuss recommendations for flexible, easily authenticated and easy to learn digital banking solutions for OAs in the future.},

abstract = {Advances in technology enable researchers to incorporate increasing amounts of user data into their research studies. However, direct and indirect involvement of users and/or their data may negatively affect users, e.g., via privacy violations or by exposing them to security vulnerabilities. Therefore, researchers must follow research ethics principles and address their work’s ethical and social implications. This process is often guided and monitored by institutionalized bodies and ethics committees, usually embedded in research institutions and publication venues. Recent events in Computer Science (CS) research on the boundary between human/social and technical research highlighted limitations in this process. Ethical reviews are effective when human involvement is evident. However, they are challenging for projects where human involvement is indirect or not the primary focus, as is mostly the case in CS. This led to cases where work was, e.g., initially authorized by the local ethical review yet later found to be unethical by the community, leading to the retraction of those papers. However, the potential harm remains done. In this paper, we take a systematic approach towards ethical reviewing procedures for CS. We do not advocate patching the current system, enforcing it legally, or creating a uniform norm framework. Instead, we take a step back and revisit the system as a whole: We first investigate the current practices of ethical reviewing, which heavily rely on individual responsibility and ex-post (after-the-fact) reviews and retractions. From that, we propose a novel FEB Federation to address systemic shortcomings of the ethical reviewing procedure in CS.},

We found tensions between the empowerment of users with additional reporting options and how it burdens users within service interfaces and processes; users need to understand the law, participate in a legal process, and differentiate between legal options and terms of service. Design choices, like the length of necessary reporting steps, also impacted expectations on the transparency of the reporting process. We close with design insights on support for users and stakeholders in the reporting process.},

abstract = {In a ‘digital by default’ society, essential services must be accessed online. This opens users to digital deception not only from criminal fraudsters but from a range of actors in a marketised digital economy. Using grounded empirical research from northern England, we show how supposedly ‘trusted’ actors, such as governments, (re)produce the insecurities and harms that they seek to prevent. Enhanced by a weakening of social institutions amid a drive for efficiency and scale, this has built a constricted, unpredictable digital channel. We conceptualise this as a “snipers’ alley”. Four key snipers articulated by participants’ lived experiences are examined: 1) Governments; 2) Business; 3) Criminal Fraudsters; and 4) Friends and Family to explore how snipers are differentially experienced and transfigure through this constricted digital channel. We discuss strategies to re-configure the alley, and how crafting and adopting opportunity models can enable more equitable forms of security for all.},

abstract = {Searchable encryption can effectively ensure the confidentiality of data stored in the untrusted third parties by encrypting the data, while also having the function of searching. However, with the increasing complexity of online services, the demand for multi-user data sharing on third-party platforms is becoming increasingly important and complex in form. Single user searchable encryption schemes are difficult to meet current needs. In response to this issue, this article proposes a searchable encryption scheme for expandable group types, which supports the establishment of multiple group relationships. We combine the hierarchical group key distribution protocol with single-user searchable encryption, and the hierarchical group key distribution protocol effectively maintains the management of the group. Legitimate members within the group can upload, search, and download encrypted data. This scheme constructs three different search encryption data patterns for different groups, namely long-term stable groups, temporary dynamic groups, and groups established between groups. Compared to the current many to many user searchable encryption schemes (which generally only support long-term stable groups), this scheme can achieve more flexible encrypted data search within and between groups. Under the framework of this scheme, any single user searchable encryption scheme can be extended to achieve secure data sharing among multiple groups. Multi functional searchable encryption schemes can be selected according to needs, and it is also easy to transplant into other existing schemes, making the application more convenient. In terms of security, it can resist more types of collusion attacks and improve the security of the scheme.},

abstract = {Enterprises and institutions are facing increasingly serious insider threats, originating from the malicious behaviors of insiders. Existing user behavior feature extraction methods, crucial for detecting insider threats, usually target specific insider threats, but these methods often lack critical user semantic and temporal information of behaviors. We propose UBTBert, a user behavior feature extraction model based on masked language model, designed to fuse user semantic and temporal information into user behavior features by constructing user behavioral texts. First, we construct user behavior texts through temporal relations on behaviors combined with name embedding and continuous behavior compression, aiming to enhance the user semantic and simplify the complexity of model inputs. Second, UBTBert is employed for extracting user behavior features, combining time embedding with word embedding to enhance the temporal information within the user behavior texts. Finally, long short-term memory is used for insider threat detection. To verify the representation of user behavior features of our proposed method, we conduct comparison experiments and ablation experiments on the CERT dataset, and the results show that UBTBert significantly outperforms baseline methods in insider threat detection.},

We conducted a mixed-methods study in Germany to understand better the practices and challenges of deploying passwordless authentication in the public sector. First, we conducted an online survey (N=108) among German public sector employees to gain insights into their experiences and challenges. Next, we partnered with an e-government vendor and performed an in-situ experiment. We let 11 employees from the public sector experience FIDO2 under real-world conditions. Our results show that only a minority of our participants were aware of current passwordless authentication procedures. In our experiment, FIDO2-based methods left an overall positive impression. Hierarchical and heterogeneous public sector structures and the need for more technical expertise and equipment were barriers to adoption.},

abstract = {Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), with their expansive world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, present a unique opportunity for end-users to create personalized AI sensors capable of reasoning about complex situations. A user could describe a desired sensing task in natural language (e.g., “let me know if my toddler is getting into mischief in the living room”), with the MLLM analyzing the camera feed and responding within just seconds. In a formative study, we found that users saw substantial value in defining their own sensors, yet struggled to articulate their unique personal requirements to the model and debug the sensors through prompting alone. To address these challenges, we developed Gensors, a system that empowers users to define customized sensors supported by the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. Gensors 1) assists users in eliciting requirements through both automatically-generated and manually created sensor criteria, 2) facilitates debugging by allowing users to isolate and test individual criteria in parallel, 3) suggests additional criteria based on user-provided images, and 4) proposes test cases to help users “stress test” sensors on potentially unforeseen scenarios. In a 12-participant user study, users reported significantly greater sense of control, understanding, and ease of communication when defining sensors using Gensors. Beyond addressing model limitations, Gensors supported users in debugging, eliciting requirements, and expressing unique personal requirements to the sensor through criteria-based reasoning; it also helped uncover users’ own “blind spots” by exposing overlooked criteria and revealing unanticipated failure modes. Finally, we describe insights into how unique characteristics of MLLMs–such as hallucinations and inconsistent responses–can impact the sensor-creation process. Together, these findings contribute to the design of future MLLM-powered sensing systems that are intuitive and customizable by everyday users.},

A robot with a natural voice could increase trust, which might result in over-reliance despite evidence for robot unreliability. To estimate the influence of a robot’s voice on trust and compliance, we design a study that consists of two experiments. In a pre-study ( (N_{1}=60) ) the most suitable natural and mechanical voice for the main study are estimated and selected for the main study. Afterward, in the main study ( (N_{2}=68) ), the influence of a robot’s voice on trust and compliance is evaluated in a cooperative game of Battleship with a robot as an assistant. During the experiment, the acceptance of the robot’s advice and response time are measured, which indicate trust and compliance, respectively. The results show that participants expect robots to sound human-like and that a robot with a natural voice is perceived as safer. Additionally, a natural voice can affect compliance. Despite repeated incorrect advice, the participants are more likely to rely on the robot with the natural voice. The results do not show a direct effect on trust. Natural voices provide increased intelligibility, and while they can increase compliance with the robot, the results indicate that natural voices might not lead to over-reliance. The results highlight the importance of incorporating voices into the design of social robots to improve communication, avoid adverse effects, and increase acceptance and adoption in society.},

year = {2025},
publisher = {AAAI Press},
abstract = {Calls to use open generative language models in academic research have highlighted the need for reproducibility and transparency in scientific research. However, the impact of generative AI extends well beyond academia, as corporations and public interest organizations have begun integrating these models into their data science pipelines. We expand this lens to include the impact of open models on organizations, focusing specifically on fact-checking organizations, which use AI to observe and analyze large volumes of circulating misinformation, yet must also ensure the reproducibility and impartiality of their work. We wanted to understand where fact-checking organizations use open models in their data science pipelines; what motivates their use of open models or proprietary models; and how their use of open or proprietary models can inform research on the societal impact of generative AI. To answer these questions, we conducted an interview study with N=24 professionals at 20 fact-checking organizations on six continents. Based on these interviews, we offer a five-component conceptual model of where fact-checking organizations employ generative AI to support or automate parts of their data science pipeline, including Data Ingestion, Data Analysis, Data Retrieval, Data Delivery, and Data Sharing. We then provide taxonomies of fact-checking organizations' motivations for using open models and the limitations that prevent them for further adopting open models, finding that they prefer open models for Organizational Autonomy, Data Privacy and Ownership, Application Specificity, and Capability Transparency. However, they nonetheless use proprietary models due to perceived advantages in Performance, Usability, and Safety, as well as Opportunity Costs related to participation in emerging generative AI ecosystems. Finally, we propose a research agenda to address limitations of both open and proprietary models. Our research provides novel perspective on open models in data-driven organizations.},

Following a 2-week deployment in a large UK educational institution, we found that anonymity helped individuals share their experiences, and that these experiences helped others understand more about the rationale for security policies. However, we also found that anonymity negatively impacted on individuals’ ability to discuss specific problems and follow up on incidents. We discuss the opportunities and challenges of using anonymous discussion platforms in organisations for improving the security culture through social participation and a more transparent listening culture.},

In Brazil, as in many Latin American countries, the unequal division of childcare responsibilities increases mothers’ risks of postpartum depression and anxiety while preventing mothers from focusing on their recovery. While today’s Voice Assistants (VAs) is promising to offer a hands-free, eyes-free and on-demand support, it remains unclear how VAs can be designed to effectively support mothers and their associated tasks during the postpartum period. To address this challenge, we conducted an online survey study with 55 Brazilian mothers to investigate how VAs support postpartum mothers and their current usage in childcare-related tasks. We identified key challenges preventing VAs from effectively supporting Brazilian mothers, including language barriers, lack of personalized information retrieval, and missing features tailored to postpartum care and early childhood needs. We then proposed a set of design considerations for how VAs could meet mothers’ needs for greater adoption in Brazil.},

We examined over 770K webpages from Chrome telemetry, finding 3.6K unique rationale texts and 749 rationale UIs across 85K pages. We extracted key rationale attributes and assessed their effect on user behavior by cross-referencing them with Chrome telemetry data. Our findings reveal nine key insights, providing the first evidence of how different rationales affect user decisions.},

abstract = {As vehicles integrate driving automation, the driver's role evolves into that of a passenger. During highly automated driving (SAE Level 4), the driver is no longer responsible for driving but can engage in non-driving related tasks (NDRT), such as working or consuming entertainment. Hence, highly automated driving changes user needs and their requirements for interior design. As part of the RUMBA research project, the authors developed an innovative vehicle interior concept to support both work and entertainment during highly automated driving by applying a user-centered design process. The innovative interior concept was evaluated against a classic vehicle interior in a static driving simulator. The study applied an experimental 2 \texttimes{} 2 factorial within-subjects research design. Forty-eight participants performed two non-driving activities (Factor 1: completing work tasks versus watching a movie) in each of the two vehicle interiors (Factor 2: innovative versus classic). Testing took place during four approximately 15-min automated drives. The vehicle's interior UX was measured as a dependent variable. According to the results, the innovative vehicle interior leads to a significantly more positive hedonic UX while working and a significantly more positive hedonic and pragmatic UX while watching a movie. It seems that a redesign of the interior of vehicles to enhance passengers' UX during highly automated driving has a promising future.},

abstract = {Programmatic hyperparameter optimization (HPO) methods, such as Bayesian optimization and evolutionary algorithms, are known for their sample efficiency in identifying optimal configurations for machine learning (ML) models. However, practitioners often use less efficient methods, such as grid search, potentially resulting in under-optimized models. This discrepancy suggests that HPO method selection may be influenced by practitioner-specific motives, which remain insufficiently understood—hindering the user-centered advancement of HPO tools. To uncover these motives, we conducted 20 semi-structured interviews and an online survey with 49 ML practitioners. We revealed six primary goals (e.g., increasing ML model understanding) and fourteen contextual factors (e.g., available computational resources) that influence practitioners’ choices of HPO methods. This study provides a conceptual foundation for understanding real-world HPO practices and informs the development of more user-centered and context-adaptive HPO tools in automated ML (AutoML).},

title = {Look Further: Socially-Compliant Navigation System in Residential Buildings},
year = {2025},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {The distance at which a mobile robot reacts to a person strongly impacts various qualities of the human-robot interaction. In this paper, we focus on the navigation of a mobile delivery robot platform in a residential indoor hallway environment. Social navigation methods typically focus on avoiding uncomfortable human-robot interactions, such as when a robot encroaches on someone's personal space. Since personal space has been shown to be in the range of just a few meters, social navigation methods typically focus on deconflicting and resolving these short-range interactions. In this work, however, we demonstrate that by extending the reaction distance to over eight meters, far beyond the typical interaction distance, we can improve the human's perception of the robot's motion. We introduce the Proactive Lane-Changing (PLC) motion pattern and a navigation system that leverages it to react to people at an increased distance. This pattern consists of changing the robot's lateral position as it navigates down the hallway from the center to the side at an eight-meter distance from an oncoming person. We conducted a user study with 42 participants to assess their impressions of the delivery robot based on three service objectives: safety, smoothness, and politeness. In the straight hallway scenario (Frontal Approach), results showed significant improvement in each of these three objectives compared to typical motion patterns found in the literature: slowing down, stopping, and reactive collision avoidance in the proximity of a person. In contrast, in the intersection (Blind Corner) scenarios, none of the approaches performed significantly better than any other, with participants having a diverse range of preferences among robot motion patterns.},

In this paper, we adapt a recipe for generating paired text-image training data for VLMs to the UI domain by combining existing pixel-based methods with a Large Language Model (LLM). Unlike prior art, our method requires no human-provided annotations, and it can be applied to any dataset of UI screenshots. We generate a dataset of 353K conversational examples paired with UIs that cover Q&amp;A, UI descriptions, and planning, and use it to fine-tune a conversational VLM for UI tasks. To assess the performance of our model, we benchmark it on UI element detection tasks, evaluate response quality, and showcase its applicability to UI verification.},

This mixed‑methods study compared learning outcomes and interaction strategies of novices using ChatGPT or human tutors. A controlled lab study with 20 students enrolled in introductory programming courses revealed that students employ markedly different interaction strategies with AI versus human tutors: ChatGPT users relied on brief, zero‑shot prompts and received lengthy, context‑rich responses but showed minimal prompt refinement, while those working with human tutors provided more contextual information and received targeted explanations. Although students distrusted ChatGPT’s accuracy, they paradoxically preferred it for basic conceptual questions due to reduced social anxiety. We offer empirically grounded recommendations for developing AI literacy in computer science education and designing learning‑focused conversational agents that balance trust‑building with maintaining the social safety that facilitates uninhibited inquiry.},

abstract = {Enterprises that own or handle sensitive resources rely on access control models to protect those resources. NIST has recently standardized a new access control model called Next Generation Access Control (NGAC) and provided a reference implementation. Despite the importance of properly functioning access control systems, little work has been done to verify that the software implementing NGAC properly conforms to the NGAC standard. Prior approaches for finding bugs are either designed to detect fail-stop faults, or model the protocol or software itself, which does not identify discrepancies between software and standards.In this paper, we solve this problem with a methodology we call policy engine differential mutation analysis, which we implement in a system called ProfessorX. ProfessorX detects access decision discrepancies between policy engine implementations—specifically, the NIST reference implementation, and our own implementation of the standard. If there are no discrepancies, we mutate the policy slightly and then try again. Using this technique, we identified two novel vulnerabilities, and show that our system is fast enough to be practically useful to developers.},

abstract = {Effective workplace communication is essential for managerial success, yet many managers lack access to tailored and sustained training. Although AI-assisted communication systems may offer scalable training solutions, little is known about how managers envision the role of AI in helping them improve their communication skills. To investigate this, we designed a conversational role-play system, CommCoach, as a functional probe to understand how managers anticipate using AI to practice their communication skills. Through semi-structured interviews, participants emphasized the value of adaptive, low-risk simulations for practicing difficult workplace conversations. They also highlighted opportunities, including human-AI teaming, transparent and context-aware feedback, and greater control over AI-generated personas. AI-assisted communication training should balance personalization, structured learning objectives, and adaptability to different user styles and contexts. However, achieving this requires carefully navigating tensions between adaptive and consistent AI feedback, realism and potential bias, and the open-ended nature of AI conversations versus structured workplace discourse.},

However, many users remain unaware of the risks. This paper explores methods to increase user awareness of privacy risks associated with LLMs in end-user applications. We conducted five co-design workshops to uncover user privacy concerns and their demand for contextual privacy information within LLMs. Based on these insights, we developed CLEAR (Contextual LLM-Empowered Privacy Policy Analysis and Risk Generation), a just-in-time contextual assistant designed to help users identify sensitive information, summarize relevant privacy policies, and highlight potential risks when sharing information with LLMs. We evaluated the usability and usefulness of CLEAR across two example domains: ChatGPT and the Gemini plugin in Gmail. Our findings demonstrated that CLEAR is easy to use and improves users’ understanding of data practices and privacy risks. We also discussed LLM’s duality in posing and mitigating privacy risks, offering design and policy implications.},

abstract = {The recent excitement around generative models has sparked a wave of proposals suggesting the replacement of human participation and labor in research and development–e.g., through surveys, experiments, and interviews—with synthetic research data generated by large language models (LLMs). We conducted interviews with 19 qualitative researchers to understand their perspectives on this paradigm shift. Initially skeptical, researchers were surprised to see similar narratives emerge in the LLM-generated data when using the interview probe. However, over several conversational turns, they went on to identify fundamental limitations, such as how LLMs foreclose participants’ consent and agency, produce responses lacking in palpability and contextual depth, and risk delegitimizing qualitative research methods. We argue that the use of LLMs as proxies for participants enacts the surrogate effect, raising ethical and epistemological concerns that extend beyond the technical limitations of current models to the core of whether LLMs fit within qualitative ways of knowing.},

abstract = {The Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol automates the issuance and renewal of secure socket layer certificates, simplifying the management of large-scale certificate deployments. To reduce the load on Certificate Authority (CA) servers, ACME employs a caching mechanism that stores domain validation (DV) results for 30 days. However, this mechanism allows attackers to reuse previously authorized results, potentially bypassing the DV process. In this paper, we introduce the ACME Authz Cache Attack, whereby an attacker can obtain fraudulent certificates without domain control. We demonstrate that even the prominent CA, Let's Encrypt, is vulnerable to this attack. To mitigate this, we propose ACME++, an enhanced protocol that binds the client's IP address and a unique identifier to the ACME account, ensuring secure authorization for each new client and effectively preventing the ACME Authz Cache Attack. Our implementation of ACME++ shows that it introduces little overhead to the CA server.},

More specifically, we studied profile creation and scam operation fraudulent donation solicitation on X, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and Telegram. By collecting data from 151,966 accounts and their 3,053,333 posts related to donations between March 2024 and May 2024, we identified 832 scammers using various techniques to deceive users into making fraudulent donations. Analyzing the fraud communication channels such as phone number, email, and external URL linked, we show that these scamming accounts perform various fraudulent donation schemes, including classic abuse such as fake fundraising website setup, crowdsourcing fundraising, and asking users to communicate via email, phone, and pay via various payment methods. Through collaboration with industry partners PayPal and cryptocurrency abuse database Chainabuse, we further validated the scams and measured the financial losses on these platforms. Our study highlights significant weaknesses in social media platforms' ability to protect users from fraudulent donations. Additionally, we recommended social media platforms, and financial services for taking proactive steps to block these fraudulent activities. Our study provides a foundation for the security community and researchers to automate detecting and mitigating fraudulent donation solicitation on social media platforms.},

These mental models centered around the role of the chatbot in the entire ecosystem. We further found that participants held a more consistent and simpler mental model towards third-party ecosystems than the first-party ones, resulting in higher trust and fewer concerns towards the third-party ecosystems.

We frequently observe significant "AI Mismatches", where the system’s actual performance falls short of what is needed to ensure safety and co-create value. These mismatches are particularly difficult to address once development is underway, highlighting the need for early-stage intervention. Navigating complex, multi-dimensional risk factors that contribute to AI Mismatches is a persistent challenge. To address it, we propose an AI Mismatch approach to anticipate and mitigate risks early on, focusing on the gap between realistic model performance and required task performance. Through an analysis of 774 AI cases, we extracted a set of critical factors, which informed the development of seven matrices that map the relationships between these factors and highlight high-risk areas. Through case studies, we demonstrate how our approach can help reduce risks in AI development.},

abstract = {Fertility trackers are popular for self-monitoring menstrual cycles and managing other aspects of reproductive or sexual health. However, the intimate nature of fertility tracking raises particular concerns about potential data (mis)use. Our study deepens understandings of fertility tracker data sharing and presents co-created mechanisms to enhance user agency over their data in intimate contexts. To achieve this, we first analysed the network transmissions from eight fertility tracker products, observing that many data transmissions appear to be tied to particular uses of the tracker and that the products communicate with endpoints associated with various organisations across different countries. This raises concerns about how intimate data is governed, used, and shared. To understand user attitudes towards data sharing in intimate contexts, we then conducted a survey exploring factors influencing user data sharing preferences. Our findings reveal that users desire transparency and control mechanisms and that their willingness to share data is influenced by contextual factors, including the third parties involved, the purposes of data collection, and the sensitivity of the data. Building on these findings, we worked with users to co-design ten concrete mechanisms for enhancing data transparency and control throughout fertility tracker product usage lifecycles. In all, our mixed-method study provides an in-depth understanding of fertility tracker data flows and preferences and proposes actionable mechanisms designers can utilise to support and protect data rights in intimate data ecosystems.},

abstract = {Malware analysis provides useful information for defending organizations against the growing number of cyberattacks. To leverage such information to enhance security, malware analysts are expected to collaborate with members of their own and other teams. However, there has been insufficient research into their actual collaboration and communication. Furthermore, given that challenges in their communication can lead to critical errors, it is imperative to understand and mitigate these challenges. We interviewed 15 malware analysts to explore their roles, collaborators, and communication means and challenges. We found that the roles within malware analysis teams are diverse and identified the roles and collaborations in which analysts leverage malware analysis knowledge effectively. We also identified several key communication challenges, including difficulties in aligning understanding in collaborative analysis and low motivation for information sharing. On the basis of our findings, we provide recommendations to address each communication challenge.},

abstract = {Early warning systems are the backbone of disaster management, but traditional systems often send static alerts with no personalized advice. This work investigates an AI-powered disaster warning system using predictive analytics and LLMs to design personalized recommendations over efficient response strategies. This system ensures that real-time information on context-specific and geographically relevant preparedness is tailored to the needs of varied populations. It was built using the LangChain framework and features an architectural composition with a predictive layer in disaster monitoring and an advisory layer for proactive safety guidelines. It integrates current weather conditions with advanced machine learning algorithms to enhance disaster prediction and utilizes LLMs in constructing customized actions, hence streamlining emergency messaging with enhanced clarity and relevance. Among the tested models, it turned out that the Gemini Pro LLM is the most effective, consistently generating outputs appropriate in context and accurate. Analysis under different temperature settings demonstrated the ability of the model to maintain high precision on various types of crises. The findings indicate that this approach can transform traditional early warning systems into more adaptive, user-centered frameworks, hence enhancing disaster management practices.},

So far, the development of VR advertising has not accounted for the voices of VR users. Since VR users will be the ones impacted by VR advertising, it is both a requirement and a moral imperative to center their voices in the discussion. We interviewed 22 VR users (14 of which had experienced VR ads, 8 of which had not) to understand their experiences with, and attitudes towards, VR advertising. Many participants had already encountered VR advertisements, ranging from static billboards in virtual worlds to virtual markets. While some participants acknowledged that VR advertising could provide benefits (including monetizing the VR ecosystem and more informative advertising), many were concerned about in-app VR advertisements ruining the immersion of VR experiences, unavoidable ads that were forced on users, privacy risks, physical harms, and manipulation. We conclude by discussing avenues for designing VR advertisements that align with users’ needs and wants.},

Recent developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and large context-aware multimodal models offer an opportunity to create memory support systems that assist older adults with common issues like object finding. This paper discusses the development of an AI-based, wearable memory assistant, MemPal, that helps older adults with a common problem, finding lost objects at home, and presents results from tests of the system in older adults’ own homes. Using visual context from a wearable camera, the multimodal LLM system creates a real-time automated text diary of the person’s activities for memory support purposes, offering object retrieval assistance using a voice-based interface. The system is designed to support additional use cases like context-based proactive safety reminders and recall of past actions. We report on a quantitative and qualitative study with N=15 older adults within their own homes that showed improved performance of object finding with audio-based assistance compared to no aid and positive overall user perceptions on the designed system. We discuss further applications of MemPal’s design as a multi-purpose memory aid and future design guidelines to adapt memory assistants to older adults’ unique needs.},

We contribute to the HCI community by conceptualizing these tool assemblages that people managing depression have constructed over time. We detail categories of tools, describe kit characteristics (intentional, adaptable, available), and present participant ideas for future mental health support technologies. We then discuss what a mental health technology kit perspective means for researchers and designers and describe design principles (building within current toolkits; creating new tools from current self-management strategies; and identifying gaps in people’s current kits) to support depression self-management across an evolving set of tools.},

By using a voice-assisted medical recovery curriculum, discharged patients can receive ongoing support as they recover. However, there exist significant medical and technology disparities among older adults, particularly among Black older adults. We recruited 26 Black older adults to participate in the design process of an IVA-enacted medical recovery curriculum by providing feedback during the early stages of design. Lack of cultural relevancy, accountability, privacy concerns, and stigmas associated with aging and disability made participants reluctant to engage with the technology unless in a position of extreme need. This study underscored the need for Black cultural representation, whether it regarded the IVA's accent, the types of media featured, or race-specific medical advice, and the need for strategies to address participants' concerns and stigmas. Participants saw the value in the curriculum for those who did not have caregivers and deliberated about the trade-offs the technology presented. We discuss tensions surrounding inclusion and representation and conclude by showing how we enacted the lessons from this study in future design plans.},

While most social media provide reporting mechanisms, in several countries, severe hateful content can alternatively be reported to law enforcement or dedicated reporting centers. However, in Germany, many youth never resort to reporting. While research in human-computer interaction has investigated adults’ views on platform-based reporting, youth perspectives and platform-independent alternatives have received little attention. By involving a diverse group of 47 German adolescents and young adults in eight focus group interviews, we investigate how youth-sensitive reporting systems for hateful content can be designed. We explore German youth’s reporting barriers, finding that on platforms, they feel particularly discouraged by deficient rule enforcement and feedback, while platform-independent alternatives are rather unknown and perceived as time-consuming and disruptive. We further elicit their requirements for platform-independent reporting tools and contribute with heuristics for designing youth-sensitive and inclusive reporting systems.},

Previous work found no standardized approach to how services address this issue, assist users, or offer backup options. Until now, it is unclear how users handle backups and account recovery and what their expectations towards service providers are. To shed light on this, we conducted 16 interviews and a survey with 95 participants. We found that most had never considered how to access their accounts if the second factor was lost, and only a few had a backup plan. Instead, users often rely on website support, assuming that personal data will help them regain access. We give recommendations for services.},

Almost half of the participants (656, 46%) experienced at least one data loss incident. Whereas 42% of 656 participants recovered using backups, over half of them had outdated or incomplete backups. High levels of stress were reported, especially by those recovering without backups or with problematic backups. In the full sample, 86% of participants created full or partial backups of at least one of their devices, the most important trigger being prior data loss experiences.},

However, concerns regarding privacy, communication, and the robot's interaction timing were also raised. The feedback highlights the need to carefully consider the robot's appearance and behaviour to ensure it enhances user experience and aligns with office social norms.

Our 7-day field study with 16 active workers from three distinct platforms and work domains showed existing affordances of data-sharing: facilitating mutual support across platforms, as well as enabling financial reflection and planning. Additionally, workers envisioned future use cases of data-sharing for collectivism (e.g., collaborative examinations of algorithmic speculations) and informing policy (e.g., around safety and pay), which motivated (latent) worker desiderata of additional capabilities and data metrics. Based on these findings, we discuss remaining challenges to address and how data-sharing tools can complement existing structures to maximize worker empowerment and policy impact.},

However, generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) brings additional design considerations and currently lacks sufficient user guidance regarding affordances, inputs, and outputs. In this context, we developed a recommender system to promote responsible AI (RAI) practices while people prompt GenAI systems, by recommending addition of sentences based on social values and removal of harmful sentences. We detail a lightweight recommender system designed to be used in prompting-time and compare its recommendations to the ones provided by three base large language models (LLMs) and two LLMs fine-tuned for the task, i.e., recommending inclusion of sentences based on social values and removal of harmful sentences from a given prompt. Results indicate that our approach has the best F1-score balance in terms of recommendations for additions and removal of sentences to promote responsible prompts, while a fine-tuned model obtained the best F1-score for additions, and our approach obtained the best F1-score for removals of harmful sentences. In addition, fine-tuned models improved the objectiveness of responses by reducing the verbosity of generated content in 93% when compared to the content generated by base models. Presented findings contribute to RAI by showing the limits and bias of existing LLMs in terms of recommendations on how to create more responsible prompts and how open-source technologies can fill this gap in prompting-time.},

abstract = {Through co-design interviews (N=19) and a design evaluation survey (N=136) with U.S. teens ages 13-18, we investigated teens' privacy management on social media. Our study revealed that 28.1% of teens with public accounts and 15.3% with private accounts experience dysfunctional fear, that is, fear that diminishes their quality of life or paralyzes them from taking necessary precautions. These fears fall into three categories: fear of uncontrolled audience reach, fear of online hostility, and fear of personal privacy missteps. While current approaches often emphasize individual vigilance and restrictive measures, our findings show this can paradoxically lead teens to either withdraw from beneficial social interactions or resign themselves to accept privacy violations, viewing them as inevitable. Drawing on teen input, we developed and evaluated ten design prototypes that emphasize empowerment over fear, system-wide explicit emphasis on privacy, clear privacy norms, and flexible controls. Survey results indicate teens perceive these approaches as effectively reducing privacy concerns while preserving social benefits. Our findings suggest that platforms will be more likely to protect teens' privacy and less likely to manufacture unnecessary fear if they include designs that minimize the impact on other users, have low trade-offs with existing features, require minimal user effort, and function independently of community behavior. Such designs include: 1) alerting users about potentially unintentional personal information disclosure and 2) following up on user reports.},

abstract = {Parents of children in speech therapy play a crucial role in delivering consistent, high-quality home practice, which is essential for helping children generalize new speech skills to everyday situations. However, this responsibility is often complicated by uncertainties in implementing therapy techniques and keeping children engaged. In this study, we explore how varying levels of AI oversight can provide informational, emotional, and practical support to parents during home speech therapy practice. Through semi-structured interviews with 20 parents, we identified key challenges they face and their ideas for AI assistance. Using these insights, we developed six design concepts, which were then evaluated by 20 Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) for their potential impact, usability, and alignment with therapy goals. Our findings contribute to the discourse on AI’s role in supporting therapeutic practices, offering design considerations that address the needs and values of both families and professionals.},

abstract = {Human-Computer Interaction practitioners have been proposing best practices in user interface design for decades. However, generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) brings additional design considerations and currently lacks sufficient user guidance regarding affordances, inputs, and outputs. In this context, we developed a recommender system to promote responsible AI (RAI) practices while people prompt GenAI systems. We detail 10 interviews with IT professionals, the resulting recommender system developed, and 20 user sessions with IT professionals interacting with our prompt recommendations. Results indicate that responsible prompting recommendations have the potential to support novice prompt engineers and raise awareness about RAI in prompting-time. They also suggest that recommendations should simultaneously maximize both a prompt’s similarity to a user’s input as well as a diversity of associated social values provided. These findings contribute to RAI by offering practical ways to provide user guidance and enrich human-GenAI interaction via prompt recommendations.},

LLM-as-a-judge approaches have emerged as a scalable solution, leveraging LLMs to evaluate generated outputs based on flexible user-defined criteria. However, users often struggle to articulate clear evaluation criteria. In addition, human preferences and criteria definitions evolve, and predefined templates fail to account for context-specific nuances. To address these challenges, we present MetricMate, an interactive tool that supports users in defining and calibrating evaluation criteria for LLM-as-a-judge systems. MetricMate introduces hierarchical criteria definitions and curated examples of success and failure to promote human-AI criteria negotiation and alignment. Additionally, MetricMate learns from users’ interactions with data by enabling users to group data to identify patterns and provide context-specific criteria.},

However, most of these works have focused on audiences and researchers, and little is known about if and how practitioners account for the socially constructed framing of data visualization. In this paper, we study and analyze how visualization practitioners understand the influence of their beliefs, values, and biases in their design processes and the challenges they experience. In 17 semi-structured interviews with designers working with race and gender demographic data, we find that a complex mix of factors interact to inform how practitioners approach their design process—including their personal experiences, values, and their understandings of power, neutrality, and politics. Based on our findings, we suggest a series of implications for research and practice in this space.},

However, there is a gap in understanding the role that such technologies can play in taking a holistic view of the user’s multiple goals, complex contexts, and constraints over time. We developed a technology probe of a personalized context-aware LLM chatbot and deployed it with 14 participants for 2-4 weeks for their 2024 New Year’s resolutions. We observed users achieve a high adoption rate of actions and greater success in the pursuit of goals in the first week, as well as the rapidly evolving user needs over time.

abstract = {Conversational agents (CAs) are one of the most promising technologies for helping older adults maintain independence longer by augmenting their support and social networks. Voice-based technology in particular is especially powerful in this regard due to its accessibility and ease of use. There is also a growing body of evidence supporting the potential use of such technology in mitigating common issues such as loneliness and isolation, particularly for independent older adults aging in place. One of the key challenges for smart technologies deployed in this context is the development and maintenance of long-term user engagement and adoption, which is often addressed by attempting to closely mimic human social interactions. However, the more human-like the system, the more glaring fault conditions become, and the more jarring they are for users. In this study we explore the effectiveness of an alternative conversational strategy meant to encourage users to engage in positive reflection and introspection. We detail the iterative design and implementation of a prototype CA developed to engage in social conversation with older adults on selected topics of interest. We then use this system as part of a multi-method approach to investigate the effect of deliberate positivity as a conversational strategy, including its impact on user impressions and willingness to continue using the CA. Our results from different approaches, including methods such as psycholinguistic analysis, user self-report, and researcher-based coding, paint a promising picture of this conversational design. We show that the deliberate encouragement by a CA of positive conversation and reflection in users has a measurable positive impact on both user enjoyment and desire to continue engaging with a system. We further demonstrate how some user characteristics may amplify this effect, and discuss the implications of these results for the design and testing of future conversational systems for older adults.},

With unique risk factors like emotional attachment, little is known on how social robots communicate these promises to consumers and whether they adequately deliver upon them within their overall product experiences prior to and during user interaction.Animated by a consumer protection lens, this paper systematically investigates manufacturer claims made for four commercially available social robots, evaluating these claims against the provided user experience and consumer reviews. We find that social robots vary widely in the manner and extent to which they communicate intelligent features and the supposed benefits of these features, while consumer perspectives similarly include a wide range of perceptions on robot and AI performance, capabilities, and product frustrations. We conclude by discussing social robots’ unique propensities for consumer risk, and consider implications for regulators, developers, and researchers of social robots.},

Attention Management Systems (AMS) are designed to help users coordinate attention in such contexts. However, while most AMS research has focused on multitasking and task-switching, their potential to guide gaze in dynamic monitoring remains unexplored. To address this, we evaluated two AMS designs in a controlled experiment (n=15) using Senders’ Dial Task: Ambient Cues and a dynamic Gaze Bubble. Although participants were more likely to follow the moving Gaze Bubble, this design led to significantly poorer performance compared to Ambient Cues and a control group without AMS assistance. Our findings show that while AMS design influences visual attention, suboptimal designs can impair task performance. Further research is needed to identify design parameters that guide attention effectively while supporting performance.},

abstract = {Psychological counseling, especially for children, heavily relies on capturing both verbal and non-verbal cues to understand and support each child’s emotional and developmental needs. Therefore, creating a detailed and accurate transcription for a child’s counseling session is crucial but often labor-intensive and time-consuming, which makes it challenging to maintain the consistency of counseling quality. Despite advancements in AI, current session analysis practices rely primarily on manual clinical assessments and struggle to accurately capture children’s verbal and non-verbal expressions. To address these challenges, we propose an AI-based expert support system designed to enhance child counseling analysis. The system comprises two key components: (i) a transcription generation model and (ii) an editable dashboard. The transcription generation model extracts verbal expressions from both children and counselors, verifies speakers’ identities, and objectively captures non-verbal cues using a Multimodal Large Language Model. The editable dashboard facilitates Counselor &amp; AI collaboration, where AI reduces human bias by providing objectivity, and counselors mitigate the risk of over-reliance on AI while maintaining oversight. This collaboration ultimately enhances workflow efficiency and leads to accurate counseling analyses. An evaluation with 48 child counselors demonstrates the system’s superior effectiveness and usability compared to existing services, with a majority expressing a strong intent to continue using our system. The system not only improves transcription accuracy but also supports more precise analysis of counseling sessions, enabling counselors to focus more on therapeutic engagements. These findings highlight the system’s potential to reduce the workload of child counselors, improve the quality of counseling services, and provide valuable resources for both individual counseling and counselor training. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to propose an AI-based expert support system optimized for generating transcriptions for child counseling analysis.},

However, as the increasing number of websites, users now often come across the issues of password overload. Such repeated use of one's passwords or choosing simple passwords such as names or dates could lead to serious security risks. Password-guessing simulations could effectively prevent these vulnerabilities. Nowadays, most modern websites request passwords with special characters to enhance their complexity. This study emphasizes the special characters within passwords. By using t-SNE visualization and KL divergence, we have analyzed the distribution of these characters among different passwords visually and quantitatively. As the result shows, special characters present a unique distribution mode in t-SNE visualization, with a higher KL divergence value than alphabetic and digit segments. Based on our findings, a password-guessing approach that classified the special character segments into four types according to the position named the Pos-PCFG model has been proposed. The model has improved the guessing accuracy of multiple datasets. In the Rockyou dataset test, accuracy was achieved with a notable 0.98% increase when guessing passwords consisting of special characters.},

While such services can reduce user effort, they also introduce a risk: the prompt provider can subtly manipulate prompts to produce heavily biased LLM responses. In this work, we show that subtle synonym replacements in prompts can increase the likelihood (by a difference up to (78%)) that LLMs mention a target concept (e.g., a brand, political party, nation). We substantiate our observations through a user study, showing that our adversarially perturbed prompts 1) are indistinguishable from unaltered prompts by humans, 2) push LLMs to recommend target concepts more often, and 3) make users more likely to notice target concepts, all without arousing suspicion. The practicality of this attack has the potential to undermine user autonomy. Among other measures, we recommend implementing warnings against using prompts from untrusted parties.},

abstract = {The cloud has become pervasive, and we ask: how can we protect cloud data against the cloud itself? For secure user-to-user communication via a cloud server, End-to-End encryption has been formally studied, building on existing TLS channels without requiring new primitives. However, enabling user-to-same-user secure outsourced data storage–solving the analogous problem of “privacy from the server” while (1) relying on existing infrastructure and (2) supporting user mobility, remains open. Existing proposals, like password-protected secret sharing, target the same goal but are incompatible with existing cloud storage services. Specifically, they lack the simplicity needed to directly utilize existing cloud storage without requiring changes on the cloud side.Here, we propose a novel system for securely storing private data in existing cloud storage with the help of a key server (necessary, given the requirements). In our system, user data is secure against threats from the cloud server, the key server, and illegitimate users. Only the legitimate user can access the data on any device using a correct passphrase. Most importantly, our system does not require the storage server to support any newly programmable operations. Moreover, leveraging the existing App login, our system requires only one passphrase, which never leaves the user’s device and remains hidden from both servers. The security is proved under formal models, and its efficiency is demonstrated by experiments conducted on Amazon S3. Notably, a preliminary variant, based on our principles, was deployed by Snapchat in their My Eyes Only module, serving hundreds of millions of users!},

This paper uses RRI principles and semi-structured interviews to examine the implications of tools designed to combat human trafficking. Although traffickers use technology to recruit and exploit victims, it also equips stakeholders, such as governments, policymakers, researchers, and anti-trafficking experts, to combat these crimes. This paper focuses on the impact of anti-trafficking software systems that identify victims and human traffickers in the United States and the United Kingdom, highlighting the positive and negative consequences of such tools and proposing strategies to mitigate unintended negative consequences, thereby promoting the development of responsible anti-trafficking tools. In addition, this paper demonstrates the practical implementation of RRI within the information and communication technology sector, with a specific focus on the evaluation of existing software systems.},

Despite numerous specialized accessibility tools, novice developers often remain unaware of them, leading to ~96% of web pages that contain accessibility violations. AI coding assistants, such as GitHub Copilot, could offer potential by generating accessibility-compliant code, but their impact remains uncertain&nbsp;[52]. Our formative study with 16 developers without accessibility training revealed three key issues in AI-assisted coding: failure to prompt AI for accessibility, omitting crucial manual steps like replacing placeholder attributes, and the inability to verify compliance. To address these issues, we developed CodeA11y, a GitHub Copilot Extension, that suggests accessibility-compliant code and displays manual validation reminders. We evaluated it through a controlled study with another 20 novice developers. Our findings demonstrate its effectiveness in guiding novice developers by reinforcing accessibility practices throughout interactions, representing a significant step towards integrating accessibility into AI coding assistants.},

This opens up a space for better management and understanding of intimate health but is not without risk. Reproductive health data collected by FemTech devices is highly sensitive and politicized. Breaches of privacy can cause or exacerbate discrimination and gender inequality, and negatively impact users’ safety and well-being. It is therefore important that users are well informed about how their data is collected, handled, used and stored. This work contributes insights into whether and to what extent this is achieved by current FemTech. We conduct a structured content analysis of 18 in-effect privacy policies. Applying an empirically-grounded taxonomy, we identify challenges in policy wording, content and presentation. We conclude with recommendations for improving transparency and supporting users in providing informed consent and claiming data authority.},

The study offers in-depth insights into affective, cognitive, and behavioral components of attitudes, ranging from annoyance and fear to appreciation for cybersecurity measures. Influencing key factors include (in)direct cybersecurity experiences and individual perceptions - both highlighting social influences. For developing positive attitudes, employees express needs related to the company’s social and cultural framework, communication styles, educational contents and formats. The study contributes to developing effective security strategies that address the individual, social, and organizational factors that shape cybersecurity attitudes, ultimately promoting a stronger organizational security.},

abstract = {Ransomware is an increasingly prevalent form of malware targeting end-users, governments, and businesses. As it has evolved, adversaries added new capabilities to their arsenal. We propose a next-generation browser-based ransomware, R\o{}B, which performs its malicious actions via web technologies, File System Access API (FSA) and WebAssembly (Wasm). R\o{}B uses this API through the victims’ browsers; hence, it does not require the victims to download and install malicious binaries. We performed extensive evaluations with three different OSs, 23 file formats, 29 distinct directories, five cloud providers, and four antivirus solutions. Our evaluations show that R\o{}B can encrypt various types of files in the local and cloud-integrated directories, external storage devices, and network-shared folders of victims. Our experiments also reveal that popular cloud solutions, Box Individual and Apple iCloud can be severely affected by R\o{}B. Moreover, we conducted tests with commercial antivirus software such as AVG, Avast, Kaspersky, and Malware Bytes that perform sensitive directory and suspicious behavior monitoring against ransomware. We verified that R\o{}B can evade these antivirus software and encrypt victim files. Moreover, existing ransomware detection solutions in the literature also cannot be a remedy against R\o{}B due to its distinct features. Therefore, in this paper, we also propose R\o{}Bguard, a new detection system for R\o{}B-like attacks. R\o{}Bguard monitors the web applications that use the FSA API via function hooking and uses a machine learning classifier to detect R\o{}B-like attacks. We implemented a proof of concept version ofR\o{}Bguard and our evaluation results show thatR\o{}Bguard can detectR\o{}B-like browser-based ransomware attacks effectively. We also provide future research directions that should be addressed in this domain.},

Multidisciplinary research has focused on how and when to deliver EMIs based on users’ contexts, but often oversimplifies or relies on proxies to represent their circumstances and environments. Here, we explore context through a user-centered lens, investigating how and when 21 young women are willing to practice IA. During a 2-week experience sampling study, they shared their activities and openness to IA throughout each day. Later, they sketched EMIs to scaffold their activities with IA and shared further qualitative insights across several one-on-one interviews. Our findings identify activities and internal and external qualities conducive to IA and offer broader implications for designing digital EMIs tailored to users’ contexts.},

The app prompted users to reflect on potential privacy leaks that a widely available LLM could easily detect, such as visual landmarks&nbsp;&amp; cues that could reveal their location, and provided ways to conceal this information. Through in-depth interviews, we found that our intervention effectively increased users’ awareness of location privacy and the risks posed by LLMs. It also encouraged users to consider the importance of maintaining control over their privacy data and sparked discussions about the future of location privacy-preserving technologies.

In this paper, we introduce CounselAR, an augmented reality (AR)-mediated therapy service designed to facilitate one-on-one therapy sessions by allowing both client and therapist to use AR filters to maintain varying degrees of anonymity. Through a six-week field deployment involving nine clients and four therapists, we explored how AR-mediated therapy might support psychotherapy from both the clients’ and therapists’ perspectives. The results illustrate the potential role of AR filters in enhancing self-disclosure, building rapport, and lowering entry barriers to psychotherapy. Drawing on these findings, we discuss the nuanced role of AR filters and the implications of leveraging AR in psychotherapy.},

abstract = {To responsibly develop Generative AI (GenAI) products, it is critical to define the scope of acceptable inputs and outputs. What constitutes a “safe” response is an actively debated question. Academic work puts an outsized focus on evaluating models by themselves for general purpose aspects such as toxicity, bias, and fairness, especially in conversational applications being used by a broad audience. In contrast, less focus is put on considering sociotechnical systems in specialized domains. Yet, those specialized systems can be subject to extensive and well-understood legal and regulatory scrutiny. These product-specific considerations need to be set in industry-specific laws, regulations, and corporate governance requirements. In this paper, we aim to highlight AI content safety considerations specific to the financial services domain and outline an associated AI content risk taxonomy. We compare this taxonomy to existing work in this space and discuss implications of risk category violations on various stakeholders. We evaluate how existing open-source technical guardrail solutions cover this taxonomy by assessing them on data collected via red-teaming activities. Our results demonstrate that these guardrails fail to detect most of the content risks we discuss.},

Such work is needed to understand and address social ills, but poses risks to researchers' well-being: sifting through volumes of data on painful human experiences risks incurring traumatic exposure in the researcher. In this paper, we explore how the principles of trauma-informed computing (TIC) can be applied to reimagine healthier tools and workflows for qualitative analysis. We apply TIC to create a design provocation called TIQA, a system for qualitative coding that leverages language modeling, semantic search, and recommendation systems to measure and mitigate an analyst's exposure to concepts they find traumatic. Through a formative study of TIQA with 15 participants, we illuminate the complexities of enacting TIC in qualitative knowledge infrastructure, and potential roles for machine assistance in mitigating researchers' trauma. To assist scholars in translating the high-level principles of TIC into sociotechnical system design, we argue for: (a) a conceptual shift from safety as exposure reduction towards safety as enablement; and (b) renewed attention to evaluating the trauma-informedness of design processes, in tandem with the outcomes of designed objects on users' well-being.},

To address the current lack of a comprehensive overview and thorough analysis of cloud computing datasets and to gain insight into their current status and future trends, in this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of existing publicly cloud computing datasets. First, we utilize a systematic mapping approach to analyze 968 scientific papers from 6 scientific databases, resulting in the retrieval of 42 datasets related to cloud computing. Second, we categorize these datasets based on 11 characteristics to assist researchers in quickly finding datasets suitable for their specific needs. Third, we provide detailed descriptions of each dataset to assist researchers in gaining a clearer understanding of their characteristics. Fourth, we select 12 mainstream datasets and conduct a comprehensive analysis and comparison of their characteristics. Finally, we discuss the weaknesses of existing datasets, identify challenges, provide recommendations for long-term dataset maintenance and updates, and outline directions for the future creation of new cloud computing datasets.

Many RP sites fail to provide sufficient privacy-related information to allow users to make informed login decisions. Moreover, privacy differences in permission requests across login options are largely hidden from users and are time-consuming to manually extract and compare. In this article, we present an empirical analysis of popular RP implementations supporting three major IdP login options (Facebook, Google, and Apple) and categorize RPs in the top 500 sites into four client-side code patterns. Informed by these RP patterns, we design and implement SSOPrivateEye (SPEye), a browser extension prototype that extracts and displays to users permission request information from SSO login options in RPs covering the three IdPs.},

Transit workers face a range of largely invisible health and safety issues that have worsened in recent years. As more attention is directed toward new technologies being commercialized in the sector these operational challenges remain largely unaddressed. Our paper contributes to a turn ''back to labor'' and describes issues bus operators face on the job. Through a diary study of bus operators' working conditions we detail how punctuated moments of workplace violence, inhumane scheduling, and unsafe operational conditions become prolonged infrastructural failure. We outline how CSCW researchers and practitioners can contribute to the design of transit systems that enhance worker dignity and contribute to ongoing efforts to address urgent health and safety concerns.},

abstract = {In the spring of 2023, Anne Arundel Community College implemented a new student and employee portal while transitioning from ADFS to Azure SSO for authentication. This change required users to log in using their full institutional email address instead of a username, which was a significant adjustment for faculty, staff, and students. Initially, AACC planned to retain its existing password policy, which required a minimum of 8 characters, and a combination of three out of four elements: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The policy also enforced a 90-day password expiration cycle for employees, with reminder emails sent beginning 14 days before expiration.After several months of using Azure SSO, AACC’s IT division discovered that Azure was not enforcing Active Directory (AD) password expiration rules as ADFS had done. This issue allowed employees to continue accessing services with expired passwords through Azure, while access to services tied directly to AD, such as wired network connections, would prompt users to change their passwords. As a significant portion of employees worked remotely, many were unaware that their passwords had expired and continued to use them without interruption.To address this oversight, the IT security team collaborated with the service desk to develop a solution to restore the 90-day password reset cycle. However, after assessing the complexity of enforcing this change, which would require extensive support and cause disruptions, AACC opted for a different approach. The situation presented an opportunity to realign the college’s password policy with the latest National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidelines. According to NIST, frequent forced password changes are no longer recommended when strong password requirements and multi-factor authentication (MFA) are in place, as periodic changes can lead to poor password habits like reusing or slightly modifying old passwords, making them vulnerable to breaches.In the spring of 2024, AACC announced the upcoming changes in its annual employee IT Security training. The new policy eliminated periodic password changes, and set a minimum password length of 14 characters. Although users initially expressed concerns about the longer passwords, they were pleased to learn that they would no longer need to reset them regularly. The Vice President of Information and Instructional Technology (IIT), in collaboration with the Technology Support Services Director and IT Security Director, developed a new Domain User password policy. The project team, led by the Service Desk Manager, created a comprehensive plan to implement these changes. The project included:· Testing and documenting the updates· Revising the AD and Azure password policies· Disabling the reminder emails· Updating the process for setting initial passwords· Communicating with end users· Providing supportDuring a one-month window over the summer and early fall, employees were able to update their passwords. Communication efforts—including email campaigns, announcements at monthly constituency meetings, and postings on the MyAACC portal—were instrumental in driving awareness and adoption of the new password standard. Nearly all active employees, totaling 2,234, successfully met the new requirements before the start of the fall semester. A small percentage of accounts, primarily active adjunct accounts that may or may not have been currently teaching, were flagged with “must change password on next login,” and their passwords were expired.Though this project originated from an oversight during the transition to Azure SSO, it ultimately provided AACC with an opportunity to modernize password policies, enhancing security and user satisfaction.},

Unlike traditional human-AI design methods, the new approach to designing generative capabilities focuses heavily on prompt engineering strategies. This shift requires a deeper understanding of how collaborative software teams establish and apply design guidelines, iteratively prototype prompts, and evaluate them to achieve specific outcomes. To explore these dynamics, we conducted design studies with 39 industry professionals, including UX designers, AI engineers, and product managers. Our findings highlight emerging practices and role shifts in AI system prototyping among multistakeholder teams. We observe various prompting and prototyping strategies, highlighting the pivotal role of to-be-generated content characteristics in enabling rapid, iterative prototyping with generative AI. By identifying associated challenges, such as the limited model interpretability and overfitting the design to specific example content, we outline considerations for generative AI prototyping.},

Through a thematic analysis of 372 user-generated posts on the ChatGPT subreddit, we found that more than half (54%) of user discourse revolved around playful interactions. The analysis further allowed us to construct a preliminary framework to describe these interactions, categorizing them into six types: reflecting, jesting, imitating, challenging, tricking, and contriving; each included sub-categories. This study contributes to HCI and CSCW by identifying the diverse ways users engage in playful interactions with AI. It examines how these interactions can help users understand AI's agency, shape human-AI relationships, and provide insights for designing AI systems.},

Participants envisioned the AI avatars to address some issues with human interpreters, such as lack of availability, and provide affordable options to expensive personalized interpreting services. Our findings indicate a range of preferences for integrating the AI avatars with actual human figures of both DHH and hearing communication partners.

It is a critical cognitive function that enables humans to perform various online processing tasks, such as dialing a phone number, recalling misplaced items’ locations, or navigating through a store. However, inherent limitations in an individual’s capacity to retain information often result in forgetting important details during such tasks. Although previous research has successfully utilized wearable and assistive technologies to enhance long-term memory functions (e.g., episodic memory), their application to supporting short-term recall in daily activities remains underexplored. To address this gap, we present Memento, a framework that uses multimodal wearable sensor data to detect significant changes in cognitive state and provide intelligent in situ cues to enhance recall. Through two user studies involving 15 and 25 participants in visual search navigation tasks, we demonstrate that participants receiving visual cues from Memento&nbsp;achieved significantly better route recall, improving approximately 20-23% compared to free recall. Furthermore, Memento&nbsp;reduced cognitive load and review time by 46% while also achieving a substantial reduction in computation time (3.86 secs vs. 15.35 secs), offering an average 75% effective compared to computer vision-based cues selection approaches.},

Through three design experiments—including a probe study with industry practitioners—we explored methods for evaluating risks and benefits using multidisciplinary collaboration. Participants demonstrated strong receptivity to addressing RAI concerns early in the process and effectively identified low-risk, high-benefit AI concepts. Our findings highlight the potential of a design-led approach to embed ethical and service design thinking at the front end of AI innovation.

A two-week field study with 12 graduate students demonstrated that engagement with PITCH increased their perceived well-being over time. We also evaluated a rotation strategy, which cycles through diverse topics every day, hypothesizing that rotation would mitigate wear-out effects and offer new perspectives. The results revealed that the specificity of a randomly chosen goal was perceived as being out of context and authoritarian, with most preferring the non-rotation version for consistency and flexibility. These findings highlight the potential of CAs to support knowledge workers and offer design considerations for varying conversations to provide topical diversity.},

These models, however, come with well-known ethical issues, which may manifest in unexpected ways in human-computer interaction research due to the extensive engagement with human subjects. This paper reports on research practices related to LLM use, drawing on 16 semi-structured interviews and a survey with 50 HCI researchers. We discuss the ways in which LLMs are already being utilized throughout the entire HCI research pipeline, from ideation to system development and paper writing. While researchers described nuanced understandings of ethical issues, they were rarely or only partially able to identify and address those ethical concerns in their own projects. This lack of action and reliance on workarounds was explained through the perceived lack of control and distributed responsibility in the LLM supply chain, the conditional nature of engaging with ethics, and competing priorities. Finally, we reflect on the implications of our findings and present opportunities to shape emerging norms of engaging with large language models in HCI research.},

Building upon prior work that highlights online news challenges and the importance of digital literacy skills, we examine user digital media skills, online news consumption behaviors, and perceptions of current misinformation tools. To better understand these dynamics, we conducted a formative, mixed methods study (n=34) that included a survey, two weeks of browser-based application logging using a Chrome plugin, and follow-up semi-structured interviews. Contradictions in the survey and log results indicate that participants in our sample often overestimate their news consumption habits. While information and news media literacy scores are generally high, less than half (47%, 16/34) exhibit lateral reading. We provide insights into users' challenges in navigating today's information landscape and propose effective integrated solutions. Interview findings inform the design of online news interventions and personal informatics tools to further improve media literacy while maintaining user privacy.},

As users navigate across the dual realities—desktop and AR—a way to move 3D objects between them is needed. We devise three baseline transition techniques based on common approaches in the literature and evaluate their usability and practicality in an initial user study (N=18). After refining both our transition techniques and the surrounding technical setup, we validate the applicability of the overall concept for real-world activities in an expert user study (N=6). In it, computational chemists followed their usual desktop workflows to build, manipulate, and analyze 3D molecular structures, but now aided with the addition of AR and our transition techniques. Based on our findings from both user studies, we provide lessons learned and takeaways for the design of 3D object transition techniques in desktop + AR environments.},

We introduce eaSEL, a system that (a) integrates social-emotional learning (SEL) curricula into children’s video consumption by generating reflection activities and (b) facilitates parent-child discussions around digital media without requiring co-consumption of videos. We present a technical evaluation of our system’s ability to detect social-emotional moments within a transcript and to generate high-quality SEL-based activities for both children and parents. Through a user study with N = 20 parent-child dyads, we find that after completing an eaSEL activity, children reflect more on the emotional content of videos. Furthermore, parents find that the tool promotes meaningful active engagement and could scaffold deeper conversations around content. Our work paves directions in how AI can support children’s social-emotional reflection of media and family connections in the digital age.},

For this paper, the authors conducted a meta-analysis of 22 HRI trust repair studies with 3,763 participants to evaluate the effectiveness of strategies for restoring trust after breaches relative to offering no repair. The analysis identified three key findings: (1) strategies are differentially effective, showing limited success in restoring trustworthiness; (2) the overall impact on repairing trust is marginal, with a small effect size; and (3) apologies and explanations are the most effective strategies for trust repair. These insights enrich HRI literature by providing a comprehensive evaluation of trust repair mechanisms, offering valuable guidance for future research and practical improvements in human-robot collaboration.},

What challenges do developers face when trying to build and debug these AI agent teams? In formative interviews with five AI agent developers, we identify core challenges: difficulty reviewing long agent conversations to localize errors, lack of support in current tools for interactive debugging, and the need for tool support to iterate on agent configuration. Based on these needs, we developed an interactive multi-agent debugging tool, AGDebugger, with a UI for browsing and sending messages, the ability to edit and reset prior agent messages, and an overview visualization for navigating complex message histories. In a two-part user study with 14 participants, we identify common user strategies for steering agents and highlight the importance of interactive message resets for debugging. Our studies deepen understanding of interfaces for debugging increasingly important agentic workflows.},

abstract = {Public libraries in the U.S. are increasingly facing labor shortages, tight budgets, and overworked staff, creating a pressing need for conversational agents to assist patrons. The democratization of generative AI has empowered public service professionals to develop AI agents by leveraging large language models. To understand the needs of non-AI library professionals in creating their own conversational agents, we conducted semi-structured interviews with library professionals (n=11) across the U.S. Insights from these interviews informed the design of AgentBuilder, a prototype tool that enables non-AI experts to create conversational agents without coding skills. We then conducted think-aloud sessions and follow-up interviews to evaluate the prototype experience and identify the key evaluation criteria emphasized by library professionals (n=12) when developing conversational agents. Our findings highlight how these professionals perceive the prototype experience and reveal five essential evaluation criteria: interpreting user intent, faithful paraphrasing, proper alignment with authoritative sources, tailoring the tone of voice, and handling unknown answers effectively. These insights provide valuable guidance for designing AI-supported "end-user creation tools" in public service domains beyond libraries.},

abstract = {Software logs, generated during the runtime of software systems, are essential for various development and analysis activities, such as anomaly detection and failure diagnosis. However, the presence of sensitive information in these logs poses significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and quasi-identifiers that could lead to re-identification risks. While general data privacy has been extensively studied, the specific domain of privacy in software logs remains underexplored, with inconsistent definitions of sensitivity and a lack of standardized guidelines for anonymization. To mitigate this gap, this study offers a comprehensive analysis of privacy in software logs from multiple perspectives. We start by performing an analysis of 25 publicly available log datasets to identify potentially sensitive attributes. Based on the result of this step, we focus on three perspectives: privacy regulations, research literature, and industry practices. We first analyze key data privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), to understand the legal requirements concerning sensitive information in logs. Second, we conduct a systematic literature review to identify common privacy attributes and practices in log anonymization, revealing gaps in existing approaches. Finally, we survey 45 industry professionals to capture practical insights on log anonymization practices. Our findings shed light on various perspectives of log privacy and reveal industry challenges, such as technical and efficiency issues while highlighting the need for standardized guidelines. By combining insights from regulatory, academic, and industry perspectives, our study aims to provide a clearer framework for identifying and protecting sensitive information in software logs.},

Central to the agent’s functionality is an innovative in-context learning method, where it either autonomously explores or learns from human demonstrations, creating a knowledge base used to execute complex tasks across diverse applications. We conducted extensive testing with our agent on over 50 tasks spanning 10 applications, ranging from social media to sophisticated image editing tools. Additionally, a user study confirmed the agent’s superior performance and practicality in handling a diverse array of high-level tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world settings.

To address this problem, we present ScriptAR, a no-code tool that helps in the creation and modification of short educational stories without the need to program. ScriptAR supports easy transition from a narrative idea to the technical realization of a game using a simple spreadsheet interface. Feedback from ten teacher candidates and six elementary school students indicate that ScriptAR allows people with little technical background to rapidly develop augmented reality educational games that can be tailored to local curriculum and classroom environments.},

To explore the privacy perspectives of users and creators, we interviewed 23 GPT users with varying levels of creation experience. Our findings reveal blurred lines between user and creator roles and their understanding of GPT data flows. Participants raised concerns about data handling during collection, processing, and dissemination, alongside the lack of privacy regulations. Creators also worried about loss of their proprietary knowledge. In response, participants adopted practices like self-censoring input, evaluating GPT actions, and minimizing usage traces. Focusing on the dual role of user-creators, we find that expertise and responsibility shape privacy perceptions.

We captured CWA users’ and non-users’ mental models of data collection and processing in the app in interviews (N = 20) and a survey study (N = 352). We investigated whether users have enough correct assumptions to be considered informed. Our findings show that the participants had misconceptions.

Unfortunately, the physical and MAC layers are not as thoroughly analyzed, even though they are neither encrypted nor integrity protected. Furthermore, the latest 5G releases significantly increase the number of low-layer control messages and procedures. We conduct a systematic vulnerability analysis of these low layers, and demonstrate that current cellular systems are susceptible to passive attacks, and active spoofing of PHY/MAC messages. For instance, we find that sniffing beamforming information enables fingerprinting-based localization and tracking of users. We also show that signal spoofing is possible in 5G NR, and more efficient compared to LTE networks. We also evaluate active attacks against COTS UEs, showing it is possible to disrupt user communications by tricking connected UEs into acting as jammers, or by stealthily disconnecting active users. In our experiments we achieve user localization within 20-meters 96% of the time, user path tracking within 15 meters for 81% of the paths, and throughput reduction by over 95% within 2 seconds (by spoofing a 39-bit DCI).},

abstract = {Emergent leadership in teams is known as a special type of informal leadership that has unique benefits. Given that this form of leadership can be developed only organically from within the team, an informal leader may not emerge and the associated advantages can be missed. We explored the possibility of leveraging robotic social behavior to facilitate the emergence of leadership in a team. We evaluated whether a robot displaying explicit peer liking towards a specific team member would encourage that team member to take the lead. Two (stranger) participants were asked to engage in a search task together with a robotic dog who either presented peer-liking behavior toward one or both of them during the opening encounter. Our findings suggest that the robot's peer liking led the ''Liked'' participant to report higher sense of leadership and higher sense of responsibility over the task. Behavioral measures also indicated that the ''Liked'' participant managed the team's performance. We suggest that integrating a robot into human teams presents an opportunity to facilitate unique dynamics that would not develop when imposing a structure on the team from the outside.},

abstract = {Today’s mapping tools fail to address the varied experiences of different mobility device users. This paper presents a large-scale online survey exploring how five mobility groups—users of canes, walkers, mobility scooters, manual wheelchairs, and motorized wheelchairs—perceive sidewalk barriers and differences therein. Using 52 sidewalk barrier images, respondents evaluated their confidence in navigating each scenario. Our findings (N=190) reveal variations in barrier perceptions across groups, while also identifying shared concerns. To further demonstrate the value of this data, we showcase its use in two custom prototypes: a visual analytics tool and a personalized routing tool. Our survey findings and open dataset advance work in accessibility-focused maps, routing algorithms, and urban planning.},

Through a platform-based document review, we analysed formal and informal documentation related to platform behaviours, to examine how the five most popular dating platforms in the UK characterise, address, and safeguard against harms. Our findings reveal the challenges of balancing platform accountability and user responsibility for safety, particularly as the goal of these platforms is for users to meet in-person. Platforms utilise proactive moderation tools and educational resources to enhance safety, yet many of these resources shift the burden of safety onto users. Moreover, we highlight the paradox of self-protection tools that both mitigate and enable harm, as well as identify inconsistencies in safeguarding provisions, for different geographic regions and marginalised groups.},

However, current AI-tools in negotiation primarily focus on outcomes, neglecting crucial aspects of the negotiation process. Through iterative user-centric design with experienced frontline negotiators (n=32), we found that flexible tools that enable contextualizing cases and exploring options (with associated risks) are more effective than those providing direct recommendations of negotiation strategies. Surprisingly, negotiators demonstrated tolerance for occasional hallucinations and biases of AI. Our findings suggest that the design of AI-assisted negotiation tools should build on practitioners’ existing practices, such as weighing different compromises and validating information with peers. This approach leverages negotiators’ expertise while enhancing their decision-making capabilities. We call for technologists to learn from and collaborate closely with frontline negotiators, applying these insights to future AI designs and jointly developing professional guidelines for AI use in humanitarian negotiations.},

However, studies show that online peer support groups are not always as effective as expected, largely due to users' negative experiences with unhelpful counselors. Peer counselors are key to the success of online peer counseling platforms, but most often do not receive appropriate training. Hence, we introduce CARE: an AI-based tool to empower and train peer counselors through practice and feedback. Concretely, CARE helps diagnose which counseling strategies are needed in a given situation and suggests example responses to counselors during their practice sessions. Building upon the Motivational Interviewing framework, CARE utilizes large-scale counseling conversation data with text generation techniques to enable these functionalities. We demonstrate the efficacy of CARE by performing quantitative evaluations and qualitative user studies through simulated chats and semi-structured interviews, finding that CARE especially helps novice counselors in challenging situations.

However, it remains difficult to evaluate LLM behavior on user-defined tasks and craft effective pipelines to do so. Many users struggle with where to start, often referred to as the "blank page problem." ChainBuddy, an AI workflow generation assistant built into the ChainForge platform, aims to tackle this issue. From a single prompt or chat, ChainBuddy generates a starter evaluative LLM pipeline in ChainForge aligned to the user’s requirements. ChainBuddy offers a straightforward and user-friendly way to plan and evaluate LLM behavior and make the process less daunting and more accessible across a wide range of possible tasks and use cases. We report a within-subjects user study comparing ChainBuddy to the baseline interface. We find that when using AI assistance, participants with a variety of technical expertise reported a less demanding workload, felt more confident, and produced higher quality pipelines evaluating LLM behavior. However, we also uncover a mismatch between subjective and objective ratings of performance: participants rated their successfulness similarly across conditions, while independent experts rated participant workflows significantly higher with AI assistance. Drawing connections to the Dunning–Kruger effect, we discuss implications for the future design of workflow generation assistants regarding the risk of over-reliance.},

In-car Augmented Reality (AR) has the potential to enhance passenger experiences by enabling interaction with the environment through NDRTs using world-fixed Points of Interest (POIs). However, the effectiveness of existing interaction techniques and visualization methods for in-car AR remains unclear. Based on a survey (N=110) and a pre-study (N=10), we developed an interactive in-car AR system using a video see-through head-mounted display to engage with POIs via eye-gaze and pinch. Users could explore passed and upcoming POIs using three visualization techniques: List, Timeline, and Minimap. We evaluated the system’s feasibility in a field study (N=21). Our findings indicate general acceptance of the system, with the List visualization being the preferred method for exploring POIs. Additionally, the study highlights limitations of current AR hardware, particularly the impact of vehicle movement on 3D interaction.},

abstract = {Embedded software is deployed in billions of devices worldwide, including in safety-sensitive systems like medical devices and autonomous vehicles. Defects in embedded software can have severe consequences. Many embedded software products incorporate Open-Source Embedded Software (EMBOSS), so it is important for EMBOSS engineers to use appropriate mechanisms to avoid defects. One of the common security practices is to use Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools, which help identify commonly occurring vulnerabilities. Existing research related to SAST tools focuses mainly on regular (or non-embedded) software. There is a lack of knowledge about the use of SAST tools in embedded software. Furthermore, embedded software greatly differs from regular software in terms of semantics, software organization, coding practices, and build setup. All of these factors influence SAST tools and could potentially affect their usage.    In this experience paper, we report on a large-scale empirical study of SAST in EMBOSS repositories. We collected a corpus of 258 of the most popular EMBOSS projects, and then measured their use of SAST tools via program analysis and a survey (N=25) of their developers. Advanced SAST tools are rarely used -- only 3% of projects go beyond trivial compiler analyses. Developers cited the perception of ineffectiveness and false positives as reasons for limited adoption. Motivated by this deficit, we applied the state-of-the-art (SOTA) CodeQL SAST tool and measured its ease of use and actual effectiveness. Across the 258 projects, CodeQL reported 709 true defects with a false positive rate of 34%. There were 535 (75%) likely security vulnerabilities, including in major projects maintained by Microsoft, Amazon, and the Apache Foundation. EMBOSS engineers have confirmed 376 (53%) of these defects, mainly by accepting our pull requests. Two CVEs were issued. Based on these results, we proposed pull requests to include our workflows as part of EMBOSS Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines, 37 (71% of active repositories) of these are already merged. In summary, we urge EMBOSS engineers to adopt the current generation of SAST tools, which offer low false positive rates and are effective at finding security-relevant defects.},

Qualitative field research involving skilled trade workers and smart hand tool design provides evidence of how care can influence technology design and how socio-technical interventions can enable expressions of care related to safety, training, and effective tool use. The paper expands the feminist consideration of care to include skilled trade workers and showcases their potential role as co-designers of socio-technical interventions. The paper concludes by recommending further research that can expand upon these emergent concepts and lead to further collaborations that benefit socio-technical system design, and the evolution of AI related to the future of work in the skilled trades.},

However, the control that businesses enjoy over the opt-out process allows them to impose hurdles on consumers aiming to opt out, including by employing dark patterns. Motivated by the enactment of the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which strengthens the CCPA and explicitly forbids certain dark patterns in the opt-out process, we investigate how dark patterns are used in opt-out processes and assess their compliance with CCPA regulations. Our research on 330 CCPA-subject websites reveals that these websites employ a variety of dark patterns. Some of these patterns are explicitly prohibited under the CCPA; others seem to take advantage of legal loopholes.},

This creates an urgent need to examine how children experience and conceptualize harm in digital contexts, which may differ from adult-driven perceptions of harm. In this paper, we present the results of a study into children’s experiences with game monetization which included a ‘think-aloud’ method in which children were given an AU$20 voucher to spend. Through our participants’ (aged 7-14) vernacular of feeling ‘scammed’ or ‘tricked’, we argue that children experience harm principally through being misled or deceived by monetization features, rather than being due to what parents perceive as a misattribution of value toward digital items or overspending. Based on these results, we make game design recommendations to minimize children’s harmful experiences with game monetization strategies.},

abstract = {Workplace concern reporting channels are essential for addressing workplace issues such as discrimination, harassment, and interpersonal conflicts, but past research has proven that existing reporting mechanisms often fail to support employees effectively. While organizations implement formal reporting channels, employees frequently experience a range of negative emotional distress, leading to silence and disengagement. Through qualitative research with 10 employees and 12 human resource (HR) professionals with experience reporting and handling concerns, respectively, this study examines the emotional barriers shaping workplace concern reporting and the misalignment between employees’ expectations and HR’s priorities. Our findings establish that fear of retaliation, power imbalances, perceptions of futility, and skepticism of systems all create additional emotional labor for employees, significantly discouraging them from reporting concerns, while HR professionals prioritize legal risk management and procedural efficiency over emotional well-being. This disconnect not only suppresses employee voice but also contributes to what we term emotional re-victimization: employees who seek redress encounter unsupported systems that exacerbate their distress rather than mitigate it. To improve current concern reporting channels, we propose a human-centered framework for workplace reporting technologies that better aligns with employee needs and HR realities, fostering psychological safety, procedural transparency, and emotional support. By reimagining reporting mechanisms with emotional resilience and organizational accountability, this study advocates concern reporting mechanisms that empower employees rather than silence them.},

To strengthen cyber resilience, organizations must equip employees with the necessary skills to defend against these threats. As cyberattacks on organizations continue to rise, building a cyber-resilient society and empowering employees with essential competencies becomes increasingly important. While prior research primarily focuses on the skills of cybersecurity professionals, limited approaches comprehensively assess the skills needed by non-professionals. This paper presents a holistic framework that identifies both hard and soft skills essential for employees to safeguard their organization from cyber threats. Based on interviews with 16 cybersecurity experts, we categorize five areas of hard skills, aligned with NIST, and six critical soft skills: communication and collaboration, responsibility, critical thinking, empathy, adaptability, as well as stress management and resilience. A literature review and expert insights highlight commonly associated challenges. Our framework provides a foundation for developing improved cybersecurity skill assessments and more targeted training programs. It aims to facilitate discussions on the essential cybersecurity skills of non-professionals, such as employees or citizens, and to support organizations in strengthening their first line of defense against cyber threats.},

AAC’s heterogeneous user groups and persistent usability issues create a challenging and rich design space. Our work takes a value-sensitive design (VSD) approach to develop a stakeholder value framework that describes stakeholders’ multi-dimensional roles and values. Our framework is based on (1) an empirical investigation—a survey and interviews—of AAC users and AAC conversation partners and (2) a conceptual investigation—a systematic literature review—of AAC HCI research. Emergent value themes were ease, fulfillment, acceptance, adaptation, safety, performance, autonomy, justice, design fulfillment, and business fulfillment. These themes inform how AAC end-users engage with AAC and how indirect stakeholders, such as AAC technologists, make choices that ultimately impact AAC users. Our stakeholder value framework and rich descriptions of AAC socio-technical barriers can inform AAC designers in making ethically sound decisions that support, not hinder, stakeholder values.},

Though recent scholarship in HCI focuses on equitable design practices, there is less focus on understanding the experiences of community-based nonprofit organizations (CBOs) when partnering with technology companies. In this paper, we focus on understanding the perspectives of CBOs by answering the following research question: What are the experiences of CBOs that have collaborated with technology companies? Through a series of design workshops with 18 participants who work at community-based nonprofits that have collaborated with technology firms, we identified four elements of community-industry collaborations that collectively shape the overall experience: divergences in cultural and organizational norms, ''setting the table,'' project relationship dynamics, and affective qualities. We conclude by discussing the power structures that impact community-industry collaboration and suggest reflective practices to guide equitable collaborations between CBOs and tech companies.},

Meaningful design outcomes require bridging a deep understanding of dementia care and the experiences of people with dementia with technological possibilities and constraints. This paper explores hackathons for facilitating such translations in the design of robotic technologies. We conducted two hackathons - one with researchers and care professionals, and another with HCI Master’s students - integrating ethnographic insights, theoretical framings, first-hand experiences, and designerly knowledge. Participants’ reflections highlight how the format fostered open-ended exploration, interdisciplinary collaboration, and mutual learning through tailored inspiration materials and structured design processes. Evaluating the concepts using Kitwood’s framework of person-centred care needs, we find that the hackathons generated meaningful concepts for human and non-human care relations. However, the outcomes also surface ethical considerations related to these relations, emphasising the need for further participatory design processes to refine and situate the outcomes.},

Prior work has sought to develop natural language processing (NLP) tools that help users identify potentially risky self-disclosures in their text, but none have been designed for or evaluated with the users they hope to protect. Absent this assessment, these tools will be limited by the social-technical gap: users need assistive tools that help them make informed decisions, not paternalistic tools that tell them to avoid self-disclosure altogether. To bridge this gap, we conducted a study with N=21 Reddit users; we had them use a state-of-the-art NLP disclosure detection model on two of their authored posts and asked them questions to understand if and how the model helped, where it fell short, and how it could be improved to help them make more informed decisions. Despite its imperfections, users responded positively to the model and highlighted its use as a tool that can help them catch mistakes, inform them of risks they were unaware of, and encourage self-reflection. However, our work also shows how, to be useful and usable, AI for supporting privacy decision-making must account for posting context, disclosure norms, and users' lived threat models, and provide explanations that help contextualize detected risks.},

In response to the current situation where key information infrastructure units rely on single security device detection capabilities, lack security data linkage analysis, and insufficient personnel security modeling capabilities when conducting threat detection, this article uses big data analysis technology to discover and warn of network security events through data mining, multi-source heterogeneous data normalization analysis, user abnormal behavior analysis, and other techniques. A prototype system has been implemented and applied in typical environments for verification, which can effectively reduce the impact of network security "noise" data, carry out multi-dimensional security data correlation analysis, and improve the ability of key information infrastructure units to quickly detect, warn, locate, and dispose of network security threats.},

abstract = {Microservices are a dominant cloud computing architecture because they enable applications to be built as collections of loosely coupled services. To provide greater observability and control into the resultant distributed system, microservices often use an overlay proxy network called a service mesh. A key advantage of service meshes is their ability to implement zero trust networking by encrypting microservice traffic with mutually authenticated TLS. However, the service mesh control plane---particularly its local certificate authority---becomes a critical point of trust. If compromised, an attacker can issue unauthorized certificates and redirect traffic to impersonating services.In this paper, we introduce our initial work in Mazu, a system designed to eliminate trust in the service mesh control plane by replacing its certificate authority with an unprivileged principal. Mazu leverages recent advances in registration-based encryption and integrates seamlessly with Istio, a widely used service mesh. Our preliminary evaluation, using Fortio macro-benchmarks and Prometheus-assisted micro-benchmarks, shows that Mazu significantly reduces the service mesh's attack surface while adding just 0.17 ms to request latency compared to mTLS-enabled Istio.},

How could the HCI community develop human-AI systems to help? Recent work on online peer counseling has led to the development of novel AI tools for conversational interaction, but it remains unknown how such technology can fit into broader practices that include extratherapeutic tasks. In this research, we conducted interviews and design exercises with seventeen peer counselors from 7 Cups of Tea, a large online therapy and counseling platform, to design tools --- AI or not --- that resolve challenges that arise from day-to-day community practices. Participant responses suggest three classes of tools that could improve online peer counseling: real-time decision support, productivity, and management and training. Investigation of design motivations surfaced four practice-based challenges including chat interface limitations, difficulties in support seeker management, fragmented contexts of practice, and lack of visibility due to privacy concerns. Based on counselors' discussion of benefits and risks associated with AI features in the tools they designed, we offer suggestions for research on AI tools embedded within peer counseling practices, and connect our findings with broader implications about online peer counseling as a form of volunteer-based mental health practice.},

While LLM-powered conversational agents (CAs) offer automation potential, their rigid sequencing and lack of humanized communication skills risk misunderstandings and incomplete data capture.

Technical evaluation on an admission interview dataset showed our system achieving performance comparable to or surpassing human-written ground truth, while outperforming prompt-engineered baselines. A between-subject study (N=44) demonstrated significantly improved user experience and data collection accuracy compared to existing solutions. We contribute a framework for humanizing medical CAs by translating clinician expertise into algorithmic strategies, alongside empirical insights for balancing efficiency and empathy in healthcare interactions, and considerations for generalizability.},

Current defenses often rely on pattern-based rules or signatures to detect phishing emails. These rules have been prone to changes in the content of the email body as they cannot comprehend the semantics of the message. Cybercriminals are using modern generative AI tools to craft phishing messages that can evade current defenses. In this paper, we present PhishEmailLLM a novel system that relies on publicly available LLMs and advanced ML models to accurately detect phishing emails. We highlight the challenges to creating and use such systems and present our solution to overcome these challenges using modern software and cloud architectures. A thorough evaluation of our system was conducted using publicly available high-quality phishing datasets. We evaluated several top of the line freely available LLMs and compared our system to well-known baseline systems for Phishing detection. We established that our meta-hybrid approach, using LLMs and traditional ML algorithms for phishing detection, outperforms other systems and costs less to run.},

Furthermore, the United States continues to grapple with criminal justice reform, employing processes such as restorative justice to replace antiquated punitive approaches to justice with a focus on the multifaceted needs of communities. Essential to the delivery of restorative justice, restorative justice practitioners are community members trained in the process and approaches of restorative practice. Like everyone else, restorative justice practitioners have transitioned from historically in-person facilitation to online facilitation, integrating videoconferencing platforms into their justice-related work. Diverse communities within Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) have been examined in light of their digital transitions and the utilization of various digital tools, including videoconferencing platforms prompted by the pandemic. However, the distinctive perspective of restorative justice practitioners in adapting restorative approaches to an online format is unexplored. Therefore, our research examines how restorative practitioners use videoconferencing platforms for justice-related interventions. To do so, we conducted six semi-structured focus group interviews with 22 US-based restorative facilitators to learn about their experiences with online delivery of restorative justice. Our research revealed that restorative facilitators uphold restorative values in their online delivery by embracing the restorative facilitation process and fostering dialogue. Furthermore, we posit that the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community can acquire valuable insights from restorative practitioners on nurturing and sustaining intimacy and connection online.},

We first conducted a formative study with six PLV to characterize their challenges and strategies in landmark selection, identifying their unique landmark categories (e.g., area silhouettes, accessibility-related objects) and preferred landmark augmentations. We then designed VisiMark, an AR interface that supports landmark perception for PLV by providing both overviews of space structures and in-situ landmark augmentations. We evaluated VisiMark with 16 PLV and found that VisiMark enabled PLV to perceive landmarks they preferred but could not easily perceive before, and changed PLV’s landmark selection from only visually-salient objects to cognitive landmarks that are more important and meaningful. We further derive design considerations for AR-based landmark augmentation systems for PLV.},

We designed our prototype based on existing ProtocolREing tool features and prior reverse engineering research’s usability guidelines.

The collaboratively generated visions for future trajectories address these enduring issues through innovative design ideas, culminating in two concrete proposals for the future of office work.},

abstract = {Collecting African American Vernacular English (AAVE) voice data presents challenges in balancing trust, community interests, and technological advancements. This study uses an autoethnographic approach to examine a collaboration between researchers at Howard University, a Historically Black College/University (HBCU), and an industry partner. We explore the challenges and opportunities that arise when HBCU researchers conduct large-scale data collection within their communities. Our findings highlight the key role HBCUs play in ethically collecting data from communities of color, emphasizing community-centered methods and the complexities of managing partnerships. We provide recommendations for future collaborations that prioritize community needs and advance technological equity, focusing on four key factors including managing trust and data ethics, managing community engagement, resource management, and managing power dynamics. This work contributes to ongoing discussions on ethical AI development, cultural preservation, and the role of HBCUs in shaping the future of voice recognition technology.},

We explored this question through two studies. Study 1 surveyed 100 workers to assess their understanding of work monitoring terminology. Participants were confident in their knowledge of key terms but struggled to accurately define them. Study 2 explored awareness of legal protection in relation to work monitoring through 19 semi-structured online interviews. We found that awareness varied with industry and work role, but was generally low and lacked certainty. Participants were largely skeptical of the use of bossware, questioning its necessity. Limited knowledge of monitoring terminology and legal protection at work further weakens workers’ ability to notice and challenge the use of monitoring tools in their workplaces. We finish by speculating on whether educating workers about bossware and workplace rights would help.},

It has been suggested to be an effective framework for envisioning more ethical technology, yet previous work on virtue ethics and technology design has remained at theoretical recommendations. Therefore, we propose an approach for identifying user experience design patterns that embody particular virtues to more concretely articulate virtuous technology designs. As a proof of concept for our approach, we documented seven design patterns for social media that uphold the virtues of Catholic Social Teaching. We interviewed 24 technology researchers and industry practitioners to evaluate these patterns. We found that overall the patterns enact the virtues they were identified to embody; our participants valued that the patterns fostered intentional conversations and personal connections. We pave a path for technology professionals to incorporate diverse virtue traditions into the development of technologies that support human flourishing.},

Our findings highlight the importance of personalized, step-by-step guidance tailored to older adults’ learning needs, as well as fostering confidence through hands-on engagement with technology. Key challenges identified include limited transportation options, poor internet connectivity, outdated devices, and a lack of familial support for learning. To address these barriers, we propose enhanced public funding, expanded access to resources, and sustainable strategies such as providing relevant and practical course materials. Additionally, innovative tools like simulated online platforms for practicing digital transactions can help reduce anxiety and enhance digital literacy among older adults.

We focus our study on US K12 public school teachers (N = 24) who regularly design and complete text-generation tasks such as creating quizzes, slide decks, word problems, reading passages, lesson plans, classroom activities, and projects. In one-on-one video- and audio-recorded virtual sessions, we observe each teacher using ChatGPT-4 for work tasks of their choosing for 15 minutes, then debrief their experience. Analyzing 201 prompts inputted by the 24 teachers, we uncover four main modes with which the teachers request support from ChatGPT: (1) make for me (55% of prompts), (2) find for me (15%), (3) jump-start for me (10.5%), and (4) iterate with me (15.5%). The first three modes (make, find, and jump-start) are often requests of generative AI to do something, whereas the fourth mode (iterate) is a request of generative AI to think. In a follow-up survey of the same 24 teachers, most report using multiple modes for their work, but infrequently. Our study contributes new data and knowledge about how teachers are coming to understand whether and how to integrate generative AI into their teaching preparation routines.},

Many participants see LLMs as promising interlocutors with attractive use cases across the stages of research, but wrestle with their performance and appropriateness. Participants surface concerns regarding the use of LLMs while protecting participant interests, and call attention to an urgent lack of norms and tooling to guide the ethical use of LLMs in research. We document the rapid and broad adoption of LLMs across surfaces, which can interfere with intentional use vital to qualitative research. We use the tensions surfaced by our participants to outline recommendations for researchers considering using LLMs in qualitative research and design principles for LLM-assisted qualitative research tools.},

In this study, we conducted interviews with 32 participants to investigate their conceptualization and understanding of PII, using period and fertility tracking apps as the context. Our findings reveal how users perceive the processes and contexts through which personal information, by becoming identifiable, transitions into PII, as well as concerns about data sharing and misuse in these apps. We conclude by advocating for addressing the misalignment between users' perceptions of PII and the regulatory protections and privacy designs surrounding it.},

We ran 4 CSIOs with IRB-approval over a period of 5 days using a panel of 225 human subjects. We explore 8 research questions based on the data collected.

abstract = {The diffusion of increasingly capable AI systems has produced concern that bad actors could intentionally misuse current or future AI systems for harm. Governments have begun to create new entities---such as AI Safety Institutes---tasked with assessing these risks. However, approaches for risk assessment are currently fragmented and would benefit from broader disciplinary expertise. As it stands, it is often unclear whether concerns about malicious use misestimate the likelihood and severity of the risks. This article advances a conceptual framework to review and structure investigation into the likelihood of an AI system (X) being applied to a malicious use (Y). We introduce a three-stage framework of (1) Plausibility (can X be used to do Y at all?), (2) Performance (how well does X do Y?), and (3) Observed use (do actors use X to do Y in practice?). At each stage, we outline key research questions, methodologies, benefits and limitations, and the types of uncertainty addressed. We also offer ideas for directions to improve risk assessment moving forward.},

abstract = {Non-cognitive skills are crucial for personal and social life well-being, and such skill development can be supported by narrative-based (e.g., storytelling) technologies. While generative AI enables interactive and role-playing storytelling, little is known about how users engage with and perceive the use of AI in social life simulation for non-cognitive skills learning. Additionally, the benefits of AI mentorship on self-reflection awareness and ability in this context remain largely underexplored. To this end, we introduced Simulife++, an interactive platform enabled by a large language model (LLM). The system allows users to act as protagonists, creating stories with one or multiple AI-based characters in diverse social scenarios. In particular, we expanded the Human-AI interaction to a Human-AI-AI collaboration by including a Sage Agent, who acts as a bystander, providing users with some perspectives and guidance on their choices and conversations in terms of non-cognitive skills to promote reflection. In a within-subject user study, our quantitative results reveal that, when accompanied by Sage Agent, users exhibit significantly higher levels of reflection on motivation, self-perceptions, and resilience &amp; coping, along with an enhanced experience of narrative transportation. Additionally, our qualitative findings suggest that Sage Agent plays a crucial role in promoting reflection on non-cognitive skills, enhancing social communication and decision-making performance, and improving overall user experience within Simulife++. Multiple supportive relationships between Sage Agent and users were also reported. We offer design implications for the application of generative AI in narrative solutions and the future potential of Sage Agent for non-cognitive skill development in broader social contexts.

Based on an interactive web study with 135 participants, we investigate SNS users’ ability to recognise and avoid dark patterns by comparing results from participants with and without ADHD. In line with prior work, we noticed overall low recognition of dark patterns with no significant differences between the two groups. Yet, ADHD individuals were able to avoid specific dark patterns more often. Our results advance previous work by understanding dark patterns in a realistic environment and offer insights into their effect on vulnerable populations.},

We found that these researchers struggle to manage access to data, especially when different types of collaborators (e.g., students, co-principal investigators) require different access settings. In response, we built DriveGroups, a Google add-on designed to alleviate participant challenges with access control, and compared its usability to unmodified Google Drive. DriveGroups allows users to manage file access from two separate perspectives: 1) the traditional file perspective and 2) a role-based group perspective, which simplifies the data sharing process.

Through two rounds of interviews and participant diaries, we show benefits and struggles of participants’ costly technology use, reflecting on what ‘cost of living’ means when technology designed to simplify older peoples lives, encounters problems. For HCI practitioners, we provide evidence of how personal smart devices can be better tailored to help older adults support themselves both economically and practically, during the cost of living crisis. We propose avenues for future research and design that better support indirect costs and reflect on how personal devices can be made self-sustaining, integrated and repairable.},

Findings indicate that queer users actively explore and adapt to the platform’s underlying moderation logic. They employ creative content and posting strategies to reduce the likelihood of their expressions of queer topics and identities being removed or suppressed. Like Western platforms, Douyin’s moderation approaches are often ambiguous; but unlike Western platforms, queer users sometimes receive clarity on moderation reasons via direct communication with moderators. Participants suggested that Douyin’s repressive moderation practices are influenced by more than just platform policies and procedures – they also reflect state-led homophobia and societal discipline. This study underscores the challenges Chinese queer communities face in maintaining online visibility and suggests that meaningful change in their experiences is unlikely without broader societal shifts towards queer acceptance.},

abstract = {Assistive technologies, such as smartphone-based object-recognition (OR) apps, provide visual assistance to people who are blind or low-vision to enable increased independent participation in society. While previous research has explored the functional accessibility of object-recognition technologies, little attention has been given to their social accessibility, particularly in interdependent socio-cultural contexts of the Global South. Through a mixed-methods approach, employing a seven-day diary study followed by one-on-one interviews with seven OR app users in India, we explore their experiences in depth. Our findings highlight the nuances of what interdependence looks like in a multicultural, Indian society, as people navigate public and private spheres with a camera-based assistive technology designed for independent, western contexts. We argue for the necessity to design assistive technologies following the interdependence framework that accommodates the social and cultural context of the Global South. Additionally, we propose design guidelines for assistive technologies in community-oriented societies, emphasizing community-centered approaches, cultural alignment, and locally adaptable designs.},

Through expert interviews and surveys, we identify and weigh key features contributing to R for wheeled robots on urban streets. Our findings reveal that pedestrian density, crowd dynamics and pedestrian flow are the most critical factors, collectively accounting for 28% of the total score. Computing robotability across New York City yields significant variation; the area of highest R is 3.0 times more “robotable” than the area of lowest R. Deployments of a physical robot on high and low robotability areas show the adequacy of the score in anticipating the ease of robot navigation. This new framework for evaluating urban landscapes aims to reduce uncertainty in robot deployment while respecting established mobility patterns and urban planning principles, contributing to the discourse on harmonious human-robot environments.},

Legal mitigations are an important avenue for victim-survivors to escape abuse, but legal professionals face many challenges when it comes to understanding, explaining, and managing cases of this technology-enabled abuse. The intersection between the law and technology-enabled abuse has been under-researched, despite technology becoming more prominent in civil and criminal legal proceedings around abuse. In this study, we addressed this research gap through semi-structured interviews with 9 legal professionals in the United States. We found that legal professionals are aware of multiple ways technology can be used to help or harm victims of IPV, and employ strategies to specifically support victims of abuse. Legal professionals also highlighted the ways marginalized demographics are further harmed by technology-enabled abuse, alongside structural and educational gaps in the legal system. We recommend further exploration of the potential avenues for education around technology-enabled abuse.},

A common way for couples in LDRs to spend time together is by playing multiplayer video games, which are often a shared hobby and therefore a preferred joint activity. However, games are relatively understudied in the context of relational maintenance for LDRs. In this work, we used a mixed-methods approach to collect data on the experiences of 13 couples in LDRs who frequently play games together. We investigated different values around various game mechanics and modalities and found significant differences in couple play styles, and also detail how couples appropriate game mechanics to express affection to each other virtually. We also created prototypes and design implications based on couples’ needs surrounding the lack of physical sensation and memorabilia storage in most popular games.},

However, the cognitive load associated with QSs has hindered their adoption in digital surveys for collective decision-making. We introduce a two-phase “organize-then-vote” QS to reduce cognitive load. As interface design significantly impacts survey results and accuracy, our design scaffolds survey takers’ decision-making while managing the cognitive load imposed by QS. In a 2x2 between-subject in-lab study on public resource allotment, we compared our interface with a traditional text interface across a QS with 6 (short) and 24 (long) options. Two-phase interface participants spent more time per option and exhibited shorter voting edit distances. We qualitatively observed shifts in cognitive effort from mechanical operations to constructing more comprehensive preferences. We conclude that this interface promoted deeper engagement, potentially reducing satisficing behaviors caused by cognitive overload in longer QSs. This research clarifies how human-centered design improves preference elicitation tools for collective decision-making.},

Reproductive healthcare providers are uniquely positioned to offer critical privacy guidance. We conducted interviews with 22 reproductive healthcare providers across the U.S. to explore their perceptions of privacy threats for abortion-seeking patients and the types of guidance they provide. Our findings show that providers are most concerned about privacy risks for vulnerable patients—minors, individuals seeking gender-affirming care, and those in abusive relationships—particularly regarding information that could be intercepted by people close to them, such as partners or relatives. However, providers generally do not perceive government surveillance or hostile actors as major threats to abortion-seeking patients. We conclude with an updated notion of informed consent and preliminary recommendations for ways healthcare providers can revise their threat models to better support the privacy of abortion-seeking patients.},

ArtInsight leverages large language models (LLMs) to craft a respectful and thorough initial description of a child’s artwork, and provides: creative AI-generated descriptions for a vivid overview, audio recording to capture the child’s own description of their artwork, and a set of AI-generated questions to facilitate discussion between blind or low-vision (BLV) family members and their children. Alongside ArtInsight, we also contribute a new rubric to score AI-generated descriptions of child-created artwork and an assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs. We evaluated ArtInsight with five groups of BLV family members and their children, and as a case study with one BLV child therapist. Our findings highlight a preference for ArtInsight’s longer, artistically-tailored descriptions over those generated by existing BLV AI tools. Participants highlighted the creative description and audio recording components as most beneficial, with the former helping “bring a picture to life” and the latter centering the child’s narrative to generate context-aware AI responses. Our findings reveal different ways that AI can be used to support art engagement, including before, during, and after interaction with the child artist, as well as expectations that BLV adults and their sighted children have about AI-powered tools.},

Errors negatively affected all outcomes. Surprisingly, despite identical driving, explanation errors reduced ratings of the AV’s driving ability. Severity and potential harm amplified the negative impact of errors. Contextual harm and driving difficulty directly impacted outcome ratings and influenced the relationship between errors and outcomes. Prior trust and expertise were positively associated with outcome ratings. Results emphasize the need for accurate, contextually adaptive, and personalized AV explanations to foster trust, reliance, satisfaction, and confidence.

To prevent these traffic analytics (TA)-based inference attacks, smart home owners are considering deploying virtual private networks (VPNs) to safeguard their smart speakers. In this work, we design a new machine learning-powered attack framework—VoiceAttack that could still accurately fingerprint voice commands on VPN-encrypted voice speaker network traffic. We evaluate VoiceAttack under 5 different real-world settings using Amazon Alexa and Google Home. Our results show that VoiceAttack could correctly infer voice command sentences with a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.68 in a closed-world setting and infer voice command categories with an MCC of 0.84 in an open-world setting by eavesdropping VPN-encrypted network traffic data. This presents a significant risk to user privacy and security, as it suggests that external on-path attackers could still potentially intercept and decipher users’ voice commands despite the VPN encryption. We then further examine the sensitivity of voice speaker commands to VoiceAttack. We find that 134 voice speaker commands are highly vulnerable to VoiceAttack. We also present a defense approach—VoiceDefense, which could inject inject appropriate traffic “noise” into voice speaker traffic. And our evaluation results show that VoiceDefense could effectively mitigate VoiceAttack on Amazon Echo and Google Home.},

Factors ranged from psychosocial and cognitive attributes to driving style, experiences, and perceived AV risks and benefits. Using the explainable AI technique SHAP, we found that perceptions of AV risks and benefits, attitudes toward feasibility and usability, institutional trust, prior experience, and a person’s mental model are the most important predictors. Surprisingly, psychosocial and many technology- and driving-specific factors were not strong predictors. Results highlight the importance of individual differences for designing trustworthy AVs for diverse groups and lead to key implications for future design and research.},

To bridge this gap, we conducted a field study at nine medical sites in Denmark and Kenya with two goals: (1) to understand the challenges faced by radiologists during chest X-ray practice and (2) to envision alternative AI futures that align with collaborative clinical work. This study uniquely grounds the AI design insights in the comprehensive characterisation of diagnostic work across multiple geographical and institutional contexts. Building on ideas articulated by interviewed radiologists (N = 18), we conceptualised five visions that transcend the traditional notions of AI support. These visions emphasise that the clinical usefulness of AI-based systems depends on their configurability and flexibility across three dimensions: type of clinical site, expertise of medical professionals, and situational and patient contexts. Addressing these dependencies requires expanding the clinical AI design space by envisioning futures rooted in the realities of practice rather than solely following the trajectory of AI development.},

This paper investigates what happens when a Western-centric AI model provides writing suggestions to users from a different cultural background. We conducted a cross-cultural controlled experiment with 118 participants from India and the United States who completed culturally grounded writing tasks with and without AI suggestions. Our analysis reveals that AI provided greater efficiency gains for Americans compared to Indians. Moreover, AI suggestions led Indian participants to adopt Western writing styles, altering not just what is written but also how it is written. These findings show that Western-centric AI models homogenize writing toward Western norms, diminishing nuances that differentiate cultural expression.},

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs), when integrated into social robots, have the potential to transform robot-assisted language learning by offering personalized, interactive communication. However, there is limited research exploring their potential to simultaneously reduce anxiety and enhance language-speaking skills among international university students, who often feel anxious when speaking a foreign language. This study addresses this gap by evaluating the impact of a humanoid robot powered by the OpenChat-3.5 LLM as a tandem partner for German language learning. Using a between-subjects design with 22 multilingual participants, two interaction conditions were tested: immersive (German-only) and bilingual (German-English). Our findings indicate that participants in the immersive mode reported experiencing significantly reduced perceived judgment by the robot compared to the bilingual mode. Although female participants showed a trend of greater improvement in learning gain, no significant gender differences were found.

abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have been positioned to revolutionize HCI, by reshaping not only the interfaces, design patterns, and sociotechnical systems that we study, but also the research practices we use. To-date, however, there has been little understanding of LLMs’ uptake in HCI. We address this gap via a systematic literature review of 153 CHI papers from 2020-24 that engage with LLMs. We taxonomize: (1) domains where LLMs are applied; (2) roles of LLMs in HCI projects; (3) contribution types; and (4) acknowledged limitations and risks. We find LLM work in 10 diverse domains, primarily via empirical and artifact contributions. Authors use LLMs in five distinct roles, including as research tools or simulated users. Still, authors often raise validity and reproducibility concerns, and overwhelmingly study closed models. We outline opportunities to improve HCI research with and on LLMs, and provide guiding questions for researchers to consider the validity and appropriateness of LLM-related work.},

Recent advancements in large language model (LLM)-based chatbots offer the potential to assist individuals in receiving immediate support. Yet, concerns remain about their reliability and safety in sensitive contexts such as ED. We explore the opportunities and potential harms of using LLM-based chatbots for ED recovery. We observe the interactions between 26&nbsp;participants with ED and an LLM-based chatbot, WellnessBot, designed to support ED recovery, over 10 days. We discovered that our participants have felt empowered in recovery by discussing ED-related stories with the chatbot, which served as a personal yet social avenue. However, we also identified harmful chatbot responses, especially concerning individuals with ED, that went unnoticed partly due to participants’ unquestioning trust in the chatbot’s reliability. Based on these findings, we provide design implications for safe and effective LLM-based interventions in ED management.},

Many parents express concerns about content appropriateness, while they also value how AI and robots could supplement their limited skill, time, and energy to support their children’s learning. We designed a card-based kit, SET, to systematically capture scenarios that have different extents of parental involvement. We developed a prototype interface, PAiREd, with a learning companion robot to deliver LLM-generated educational content that can be reviewed and revised by parents. Parents can flexibly adjust their involvement in the activity by determining what they want the robot to help with. We conducted an in-home field study involving 20 families with children aged 3–5. Our work contributes to an empirical understanding of the level of support parents with different expectations may need from AI and robots and a prototype that demonstrates an innovative interaction paradigm for flexibly including parents in supporting their children.},

To explore how non-experts perceive cybersecurity definitions and identify potential areas of misunderstanding and misconception, we performed a semi-structured interview study with 30 non-experts of different generations (ages) and education levels. Our findings reveal that non-experts may have incomplete mental models of cybersecurity, misinterpret terms and concepts commonly used in definitions, and express strong preferences for how cybersecurity is defined.

Leveraging a unique confidence-based turn-taking model, these agents organically take turns as they build on ideas, pose clarification questions to the user for improved contextual understanding, and allow the user to interject and steer the conversation. Beyond addressing the limitations of traditional ideation, this framework offers a novel approach to leveraging Generative AI for ideation, moving away from the rigidity of pre-defined interaction rules towards a more dynamic and creative process that enables serendipitous development of ideas.},

abstract = {Misinformation is “sticky” in nature, requiring a considerable effort to undo its influence. One such effort is debunking or exposing the falsity of information. As an abundance of misinformation is on social media, platforms do bear some debunking responsibility in order to preserve their trustworthiness as information providers. A subject of interpretation, platforms poorly meet this responsibility and allow dangerous health misinformation to influence many of their users. This open route to harm did not sit well with health professional users, who recently decided to take the debunking into their own hands. To study this individual debunking effort — which we call ‘Debunk-It-Yourself’ — we conducted an exploratory survey n=14 health professionals who wage a misinformation counter-influence campaign through videos on TikTok. We focused on two topics, nutrition and mental health, which are the ones most often subjected to misinformation on the platform. Our analysis reveals that the counterinfluence follows a common process of initiation, selection, creation, and “stitching” or duetting a debunking video with a misinformation video. The ‘Debunk-It-Yourself’ effort was underpinned by three unique aspects: (i) it targets trending misinformation claims perceived to be of direct harm to people’s health; (ii) it offers a symmetric response to the misinformation; and (iii) it is strictly based on scientific evidence and claimed clinical experience. Contrasting the ‘Debunk-It-Yourself’ effort with the one TikTok and other platforms (reluctantly) put in moderation, we offer recommendations for a structured response against the misinformation’s influence by the users themselves.},

Our study used mixed-methods with an exploratory survey (125 real-world secret use cases reported) and a controlled experiment among 300 users to investigate the contexts and causes behind the secret use of LLMs. We found that such secretive behavior is often triggered by certain tasks, transcending demographic and personality differences among users. Task types were found to affect users' intentions to use secretive behavior, primarily through influencing perceived external judgment regarding LLM usage. Our results yield important insights for future work on designing interventions to encourage more transparent disclosure of the use of LLMs or other AI technologies.},

Results showed that even though most events triggered by the wearable were meaningful, only one in five warranted an intervention.

Our findings center clinicians’ perspectives on aligning outcomes data for payment programs and care; opportunities for health technologies and personal devices to improve data collection; and considerations for using outcomes data to hold stakeholders including clinicians, health insurers, and social services financially accountable in value-based mental healthcare. We conclude with implications for future research designing and developing technologies supporting value-based care across stakeholders involved with mental health service delivery.},

Two user studies demonstrate that MentalImager not only improves seekers' satisfaction with their self-disclosure in their posts but also invokes support-providers' empathy for the seekers and willingness to offer help. Such improvements are credited to the generated images, which help seekers express their emotions and inspire them to add more details about their experiences and feelings.

abstract = {As a new type of DDoS attack, the link flooding attack (LFA) aims to paralyze the critical links of the network to isolate the target area. LFA has the characteristics that the traffic similarity between a single attacking host and legitimate hosts is high, and its bandwidth occupation ratio is small, which makes detection difficult. However, the existing methods still rely on the traditional DDoS detection features, and these methods are hardly applicable when detecting LFA. To effectively defend against LFA, we propose a service-priority-based link flooding attack detection and mitigation method (SPM) on the software defined network (SDN). The SPM method focuses on specific target services and monitors the critical links by constructing the mapping relationship between services and links. By deeply analyzing the characteristics of LFA attack behaviors, it extracts the host behavior features from the flow table information of switches during the congestion period and uses machine learning models to judge the features. For the detected malicious hosts, SPM adopts a defense strategy of quick mitigation and slow detection to reduce the impact on legitimate hosts. Based on the experimental results of the simulation platform, in different attack environments, compared with the comparison methods, the SPM method can quickly identify malicious hosts. Moreover, the detection rate of malicious hosts by the SPM method reaches more than 90%, and the false positive rate is lower than 1.5%.},

abstract = {The devastating health, societal, and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic illuminate potential dangers of unpreparedness for catastrophic pandemic-scale cyber events. While the nature of these threats differs, the responses to COVID-19 illustrate valuable lessons that can guide preparation and response to cyber events. Drawing on the critical role of collaboration and pre-defined roles in pandemic response, we emphasize the need for developing similar doctrine and skill sets for cyber threats. We provide a framework for action by presenting the characteristics of a pandemic-scale cyber event and differentiating it from smaller-scale incidents the world has previously experienced. The framework is focused on the United States. We analyze six critical lessons from COVID-19, outlining key considerations for successful preparedness, acknowledging the limitations of the pandemic metaphor, and offering actionable steps for developing a robust cyber defense playbook. By learning from COVID-19, government agencies, private sector, cybersecurity professionals, academic researchers, and policy makers can build proactive strategies that safeguard critical infrastructure, minimize economic damage, and ensure societal resilience in the face of future cyber events.},

abstract = {In organizations, the interest in automation is long-standing. However, adopting automated processes remains challenging, even in environments that appear highly standardized and technically suitable for it. Through a case study in Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, this paper investigates automation as a broader sociotechnical system influenced by a complex network of actors and contextual factors. We study practitioners’ collective understandings of automation and subsequent efforts taken to implement it. Using imaginaries as a lens, we report findings from a qualitative interview study with 16 practitioners involved in airside automation projects. Our findings illustrate the organizational dynamics and complexities surrounding automation adoption, as reflected in the captured problem formulations, conceptions of the technology, envisioned human roles in autonomous operations, and perspectives on automation fit in the airside ecosystem. Ultimately, we advocate for contextual automation design, which carefully considers human roles, accounts for existing organizational politics, and avoids techno-solutionist approaches.},

abstract = {Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a prominent application of smart contracts, representing a novel financial paradigm in contrast to centralized finance. While DeFi applications are rapidly emerging on mainstream blockchain platforms, their quality varies greatly, presenting numerous challenges, particularly in terms of their governance mechanisms. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of governance issues in DeFi applications. Initially, we collected 3,165 academic papers and numerous industry reports. After thorough screening, we selected 44 academic papers and 11 industry reports for detailed analysis. Drawing upon insights from industry reports and academic research articles, we develop a taxonomy to categorize these governance issues. We collect and build a dataset of 4,446 audit reports from seventeen Web3 security companies, categorizing their governance issues according to our constructed taxonomy. We conducted a thorough analysis of governance issues and identified vulnerabilities in the governance design and implementation, e.g., voting sybil attack and proposal front-running. Our statistical analysis indicates that a significant portion (35.48%) of governance-related issues is classified as severe. Within these, ownership-related problems constitute the largest share (65.38%). Despite DeFi governance being essential for the long-term success of DeFi projects, our data shows that both auditors and development teams have not fully grasped its significance. Based on audit reports, we also analyzed common vulnerabilities and issues in the governance domain. Our research identifies two primary categories of DeFi governance issues: technology-centric and human-centric. Technology-centric issues can be addressed through technology updates and iterations, whereas human-centric issues are influenced not only by the development team's technical skills but also by their understanding of DeFi governance. Data analysis reveals that design and implementation issues are frequently overlooked; although not directly associated with vulnerabilities, these issues can impact the equitable distribution of project benefits. Furthermore, our analysis of 104 projects’ tokenomics configurations, including 15 collected from DeFi platforms, uncovered 27 inconsistent configurations, with only two projects exhibiting no issues. This suggests that such issues are relatively common. We therefore advise project teams to ensure consistency between their tokenomics design and the actual code. Our study culminates in providing several key practical implications for various DeFi stakeholders, including developers, users, researchers, and regulators, aiming to deepen the understanding of DeFi governance issues and contribute to the robust growth of DeFi systems.},

This study employed a mixed-methods approach, utilizing both qualitative and quantitative data, to investigate how people use various open-design spaces in a new university building. Initial workshops and interviews with students and facility managers clarified their preferences and operational needs. The sensor data provided valuable insights into student space usage, improving communication between students and facility managers by offering a clearer understanding of student behaviors and needs, which enhances the ability of facility managers to make more informed decisions. Follow-up interviews with facility managers provided additional perspectives on the effectiveness of sensor-based solutions in educational settings. The study identified patterns in space usage and discovered opportunities for improving educational facilities. It emphasizes the importance of monitoring both space usage and environmental conditions and highlights the potential to support more informed decision-making in facility management. Future research will explore predictive modeling to better manage space and expand environmental metrics to further enhance educational environments, promote sustainability, and contribute to sustainable societies.},

Specifically, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 14 researchers to gather insights on their experiences generating and analyzing Online Social Network (OSN) communications datasets. Following Braun and Clarke's six-phase TA framework with an inductive approach, we initially analyzed our interview transcripts with human experts. Subsequently, we iteratively designed prompts to guide LLMs through a similar process. We compare and discuss the manually analyzed outcomes with responses generated by LLMs and achieve a cosine similarity score up to 0.76, demonstrating a promising prospect for LATA. Additionally, the study delves into researchers' experiences navigating the complexities of collecting and analyzing OSN data, offering recommendations for future research and application designers.},

To unpack factors that are important in developing a sense of home and belonging in refugee communities, we lean on the theoretical concept of ’place-belongingness’ - we did this by conducting 6 co-design workshops involving 15 refugee participants, via the ’Magic Machine’ workshop approach. From the workshops, we uncovered how cultural identity and memory, life stability and normalcy, security and privacy, resilience and ingenuity, and social connections are central to their sense of home. This research contributes to HCI by building on the theoretical concept of place-belongingness in the context of forced displacement, proposing design implications that address refugees’ needs for home from cultural and social dimensions, and design considerations for refugees’ domestic settings.},

Effective revision requires mindful reflection upon feedback, but the scale and variability of feedback can make it challenging for novice writers to decipher it into actionable, meaningful changes. Friction leverages large language models to break down large feedback collections into manageable units, visualizes their distribution across sentences and issues through a co-located heatmap, and guides users through structured reflection and revision with adaptive hints and real-time evaluation. Our user study (N = 16) showed that Friction helped users allocate more time to reflective planning, attend to more critical issues, develop more actionable and satisfactory revision plans, iterate more frequently, and ultimately produce higher-quality revisions, compared to the baseline system. These findings highlight the potential of human-AI collaboration to foster a balanced approach between maximum efficiency and deliberate reflection, supporting the development of creative mastery.},

abstract = {Robotic assisted living environments are currently lacking in accessibility for individuals with sight loss. To address this need, this preliminary study designs and evaluates a bespoke robotic tour guide which provides meaningful first-time interactions for people with sight loss in a robotic assisted living lab. We engaged 8 participants with sight loss between the ages of 20 and 80 years old, in a counterbalanced, within-subjects study comparing their experiences of a guided tour of a robotic assisted living lab led by a Temi robot, to the same guided tour led by a trained human tour guide. Results show that the robotic tour guide for people with sight loss is perceived as warm and competent, with low discomfort in the human-robot interaction. Findings also show that the tour guided by the robot is perceived to be equally engaging and useful as the tour led by the trained human tour guide, and does not lead to an increase in workload. Key findings highlight the importance of tactile exploration, multimodal interaction, and enhanced control, and identify differing needs between users who are blind and partially sighted.},

We assessed user experience, engagement and psychological characteristics involved in the behavior change process. Results showed satisfactory user experience, impact of tailoring on user behavior and features to reduce fears and false beliefs and increase self-efficacy. Further efforts are needed to increase user engagement and observe an impact on long-term behavior.},

The existing parental control tools fail to account for these differences, leaving a notable gap in the literature on parental mediation. To this end, we conducted 10 focus group sessions with a total of 20 parents to understand their preferences for age-appropriate design components that promote self-regulation and open communication, followed by an ideation workshop with four UX design experts to translate these preferences into customized features. We then evaluated these designs (presented as storyboards) through semi-structured interviews with 25 parents. Our study joins the body of work on parental mediation, providing valuable insights into customizing parental control settings as children transition through the developmental stages.

The lesson center introduces students to basic concepts such as HTTP status codes and cookies, and asks them to carry out simple tasks within the social media network. Furthermore, students can look behind the curtains to see what kind of data is generated through interactions with the network. The ultimate goal is to "hack" into the social media network and impersonate a different user.Our system is designed in a modular way, so the social media network can be exchanged for a different "target application," such as an email client or a chat application. It can thus be used to teach a wide range of security topics, while mimicking real-world settings.},

To address this gap, we introduce Patrika, an AI-enabled prototype designed specifically for people with Parkinson’s disease (PwPD). The system incorporates cooperative conversation principles, clinical interview simulations, and personalization to create a more effective and user-friendly journaling experience. Through two user studies with PwPD and iterative refinement of Patrika, we demonstrate conversational journaling’s significant potential in patient engagement and collecting clinically valuable information. Our results showed that generating probing questions Patrika turned journaling into a bi-directional interaction. Additionally, we offer insights for designing journaling systems for healthcare and future directions for promoting sustained journaling.},

In this paper, we examine the role of technology in moments of crisis and the tensions mutual aid groups face when relying on tools designed with values that may be antithetical to their own. Through a qualitative study with mutual aid volunteers in the United States, we found that mutual aid groups’ values, such as solidarity, security, and co-production, are prioritized as they navigate adopting technology. However, while technology can streamline logistics and enhance visibility for mutual aid groups, we argue that the adoption of existing technologies and conventions of practice can erode opportunities for building solidarity, present challenges for accountability, and exacerbate pre-existing social exclusions. We argue that these tensions emerge not simply as a mismatch between values and technical design, but as systematic outcomes of adopting tools that embed different political assumptions and points of access. Our findings contribute to understanding how values shape — and are shaped by — technological infrastructure in mutual aid work.},

While workers express concern about risks to their health, safety, and privacy, they also face a lack of transparency and autonomy around the use of these systems. In response, workers take up tactics of everyday resistance, such as commiserating with other workers or employing technological hacks. Although these tactics demonstrate workers' ingenuity, they also show the limitations of existing approaches to protect workers against intrusive workplace monitoring.

Our findings reveal varying patterns of simultaneous technology use—shared, parallel, and imbalanced— distinguishing between instrumental and ritualistic purpose of use. Whereas positive effects of simultaneous use include enhancing conversations and deepening engagement, participants report negative consequences such as disrupting conversations and hindering meaningful exchange.

abstract = {Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) provide support to children with speech and language difficulties through delivering evaluation, assessment, and interventions. Despite growing research on how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can support SLPs, there is limited research examining how AI can assist SLPs in delivering equitable care to culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) children with disabilities. Through interviews with 15 SLPs and a two-part survey study with 13 SLPs, we report on SLP challenges in delivering responsive care to CLD children with disabilities (i.e.,&nbsp;unrepresentative materials, unreliable translation, insufficient support for language variations), areas for AI-based support, evaluations of how available AI performs in addressing these challenges, and bias assessments of AI-generated materials. We discuss implications of contextually unaware AI, the range of care in AI-prompting, tensions and tradeoffs of AI-based support, and honoring diverse representations in AI-generated materials. We offer considerations for SLPs using AI-based tools and general-purpose AI in their practice.},

abstract = {With the growth of AI, researchers are studying how to mitigate its environmental impact, primarily by proposing policy changes and increasing awareness among developers. However, research on AI end users is limited. Therefore, we introduce GPTFootprint, a browser extension that aims to increase consumer awareness of the significant water and energy consumption of LLMs, and reduce unnecessary LLM usage. GPTFootprint displays a dynamically updating visualization of the resources individual users consume through their ChatGPT queries. After a user reaches a set query limit, a popup prompts them to take a break from ChatGPT. In a week-long user study, we found that GPTFootprint increases people’s awareness of environmental impact, but has limited success in decreasing ChatGPT usage. This research demonstrates the potential for individual-level interventions to contribute to the broader goal of sustainable AI usage, and provides insights into the effectiveness of awareness-based behavior modification strategies in the context of LLMs.},

abstract = {Videoconferencing is integral to modern work and living. Recently, technologists have sought to leverage data captured – e.g. from cameras and microphones – to augment communication. This might mean capturing communication information about verbal (e.g. speech, chat messages), or non-verbal exchanges (e.g. body language, gestures, tone of voice) and using this to mediate – and potentially improve – communication. However, such tracking has implications for user experience and raises wider concerns (e.g. privacy). To design tools which account for user needs and preferences, this study investigates perspectives on communication tracking through a global survey and interviews, exploring how daily behaviours and the impact of specific features influence user perspectives. We examine user preferences on non-verbal communication tracking, preferred methods of how this information is conveyed and to whom this should be communicated. Our findings aim to guide the development of non-verbal communication tools which augment videoconferencing that prioritise user needs.},

In this industry case study, we investigate opportunities for large language models (LLMs) to evaluate agile epic quality in a global company. Results from a user study with 17 product managers indicate how LLM evaluations could be integrated into their work practices, including perceived values and usage in improving their epics. High levels of satisfaction indicate that agile epics are a new, viable application of AI evaluations. However, our findings also outline challenges, limitations, and adoption barriers that can inform both practitioners and researchers on the integration of such evaluations into future agile work practices.},

In a research project, we explored the potential of a thigh-worn wearable device that allows passengers to interact with the onboard system and operate a roof-mounted surveillance camera. This includes actions such as navigating menus, selecting items, controlling media playback, and adjusting camera orientation, zoom, or recording. We conducted a Gesture Elicitation Study (GES) in a simulated vehicular XR environment with 24 referents, where 21 participants (N = 21) interacted with our prototype, ThighTouchI. This empirical study identified 79 unique gestures from 504 proposals, revealing that users favored ThighTouchI as a pad for selection tasks, using single-finger gestures for simple actions and multi-finger gestures for complex tasks. Additionally, a consensus gesture set was derived, and mapping of the tactile surface showed that  (88.7%)  of the gestures were proposed in the central area. Participants utilized different zones of the touch surface depending on the referent, underscoring its ergonomic importance.},

Caregivers seek help everywhere but face unique challenges including limited access to timely resources and personal mental health struggles. Mobile health apps offer a promising solution, but addressing caregivers’ specific needs remains a concern. We present LifeLink, a persuasive mobile app to support caregivers of individuals experiencing suicidal thoughts. The app was developed in three stages. First, we reviewed 80 existing suicide prevention apps. Second, we designed a low-fidelity prototype of LifeLink using the Persuasive System Design model and refined it through a study conducted with 45 caregivers. Finally, incorporating evidence-based strategies and caregiver feedback, we developed and evaluated LifeLink in another study with 50 caregivers. Results show that LifeLink is user-friendly, engaging, elicits positive user experience and effectively empowers caregivers. LifeLink usage was associated with improved mental wellbeing, increased mental health literacy, and a more supportive environment. Our findings highlight the importance of involving caregivers in the design process. We offer recommendations for designers and researchers developing impactful persuasive technology for suicide prevention and for those working in related areas.},

abstract = {In recent years, organizations have been incorporating gamification elements and techniques into security compliance training, and research has shown positive outcomes resulting from using gamification in security compliance training. However, research has focused on training using game elements within one-time (or periodic) dedicated training sessions, where training occurs outside an employee's regular work context. Consequently, even if gamified, this ''away from the actual job'' approach may limit the ability to readily draw on earlier training and stay vigilant against phishing attacks once he/she returns to normal job duties. Contrasted with the approach used in prior research, this study proposes mixing gamified security training with the reality of day-to-day work activities, which we call quasi-mixed reality in gamified security training. Specifically, the security training proposed in this study is a several-week-long program that takes place in employees' regular work context while they perform their everyday job tasks. In a randomized field experiment, we find that employees who were randomly assigned to experience quasi-mixed reality in gamified phishing training performed better in detecting and avoiding phishing attacks than those who were assigned to a control group. In addition, we propose and articulate mindfulness of phishing as a psychological mechanism and develop a path model based on mindfulness of phishing to provide insights into how the quasi-mixed reality gamified phishing training improves employee behavior regarding phishing detection and avoidance.},

In response, Digibyte was developed to centralise digital storage, while promoting awareness and habit change through game-like features and positive reinforcement. Digibyte empowers users by supporting their decluttering process and reflect on their digital storage habits.

Recently, social virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a promising platform to support well-being activities. While Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research has explored technologies for meditation, little is known about how users appropriate social VR for meditation, particularly group practice, and how it shapes their experiences. To bridge this gap, we interviewed 13 regular social VR meditators to explore their practices, perceived benefits, and challenges. We found that meditators utilized platform features to engage in community-driven group practices, manage session flow, employ avatars and body tracking for kinetic practices, and experiment with novel forms of meditation. Participants reported benefits and challenges related to the individual and social aspects of their meditation experiences. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications of using social VR for meditation, including how avatars and virtual others positively affect the practice, as well as emerging tensions and opportunities.},

However, studies have questioned their ability to produce secure code and, thereby, the quality of prompt-generated software. Alongside, various prompting techniques that carefully tailor prompts have emerged to elicit optimal responses from LLMs. Still, the interplay between such prompting strategies and secure code generation remains under-explored and calls for further investigations. Objective: In this study, we investigate the impact of different prompting techniques on the security of code generated from NL instructions by LLMs. Method: First we perform a systematic literature review to identify the existing prompting techniques that can be used for code generation tasks. A subset of these techniques are evaluated on GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 models for secure code generation. For this, we used an existing dataset consisting of 150 NL security-relevant code-generation prompts. Results: Our work (i) classifies potential prompting techniques for code generation (ii) adapts and evaluates a subset of the identified techniques for secure code generation tasks and (iii) observes a reduction in security weaknesses across the tested LLMs, especially after using an existing technique called Recursive Criticism and Improvement (RCI), contributing valuable insights to the ongoing discourse on LLM-generated code security.},

We conducted 12 interviews with website owners in Denmark from websites where their compliance had improved over the course of three years.

Rather, the configuration and maintenance of the interfaces happened in collaboration with a diverse network of actors, with third-party consent management platforms playing a central role.

Our findings show how a vibrant and growing user base of subscription-based online services is using creative and sometimes risky ways to gain access to media and information through informal intermediaries and administrators. Finally, we discuss potential directions for practice and policy innovations that include facilitating international payments for online services and platforms and reconsidering their policies and service delivery mechanisms to better support users in the Global South context.},

The operationalization is based on drivers’ headway maintenance during in-car tasks as compared to baseline driving, while accommodating situational and driver-specific variables, such as brake response times. Realistic visual looming cues enable evaluation of distraction effects on cognitive processes crucial for safe driving. Validation studies with two 2024 car models indicate that the method can reliably differentiate distraction effects between cars, in-car tasks, and drivers as large, medium, small, or no effect on crash potential. The method supports design of in-car interactions by providing valid means to reveal the worst and best practices in in-car user interface design.},

Leveraging LLMs to simulate natural interactions, the game challenges players to impersonate characters and extract sensitive information from an AI agent, Aegis. A user study (n=22) revealed that players employed diverse deceptive linguistic strategies, including storytelling and emotional rapport, to manipulate Aegis. After playing, players reported connecting in-game scenarios with real-world privacy vulnerabilities, such as phishing and impersonation, and expressed intentions to strengthen privacy control, such as avoiding oversharing personal information with AI systems. This work highlights the potential of LLMs to simulate complex relational interactions in serious games, while demonstrating how an adversarial game strategy provides unique insights for designs for social good, particularly privacy protection.},

While prior research has analyzed the potential benefits and attitudes of practitioners and the public when leveraging social media during disasters, a gap exists in the critical analysis of the actual practices and uses of social media among EM agencies, across both geographical regions and phases of the EM lifecycle - typically mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. In this paper, we conduct a mixed-method analysis to update and fill this gap on how EM practitioners in the U.S. and Europe use social media, building on a survey study of about 150 professionals and a follow-up interview study with 11 participants. The results indicate that using social media is no longer a non-traditional practice in operational and informational processes for the decision-making of EM agencies working at both the local level (e.g., county or town) and non-local level (e.g., state/province, federal/national) for emergency management. Especially, the practitioners affiliated with agencies working at the local level have a very high perceived value of social media for situational awareness (e.g., analyzing disaster extent and impact) and public communication (e.g., disseminating timely information and correcting errors in crisis coverage). Further, practitioners now engage with the public during the preparedness phase to mobilize them during the response phase. We present a model to understand the current practices of communication between agencies and the public, as well as among practitioners while leveraging social media. We also discuss novel challenges, including public fragmentation caused by the increasing use of multiple social media platforms, information integrity, and social listening expectations. We conclude with the policy, technological, and socio-technical needs to design future social media analytics systems to support the work of EM agencies in such communication.},

However, much of the research focus remains broad and does not address the specific technical needs of investigative journalists. Therefore, this paper presents several applied use cases where automation and AI intersect with investigative journalism. We conducted a within-subjects user study with eight investigative journalists. In interviews, we elicited practical use cases using a speculative design approach by having journalists react to a prototype of a system that combines LLMs and Programming-by-Demonstration (PbD) to simplify data collection on numerous websites. Based on user reports, we classified the journalistic processes into data collecting and reporting. Participants indicated they utilize automation to handle repetitive tasks like content monitoring, web scraping, summarization, and preliminary data exploration. Following these insights, we provide guidelines on how investigative journalism can benefit from AI and automation.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed increasing calls for computing researchers to grapple with the societal impacts of their work. Tools such as impact assessments have gained prominence as a method to uncover potential impacts, and a number of publication venues now encourage authors to include an impact statement in their submissions. Despite this recent push, little is known about the way researchers go about assessing, articulating, and addressing the potential negative societal impact of their work --- especially in industry settings, where research outcomes are often quickly integrated into products and services. In addition, while there are nascent efforts to support researchers in this task, there remains a dearth of empirically-informed tools and processes. Through interviews with 25 industry computing researchers across different companies and research areas, we identify four key factors that influence how they grapple with (or choose not to grapple with) the societal impact of their research: the relationship between industry researchers and product teams; organizational dynamics and cultures that prioritize innovation and speed; misconceptions about societal impact; and a lack of sufficient infrastructure to support researchers. To develop an effective impact assessment template tailored to industry computing researchers' needs, we conduct an iterative co-design process with these 25 industry researchers, along with an additional 16 researchers and practitioners with prior experience and expertise in reviewing and developing impact assessments or responsible computing practices more broadly. Through the co-design process, we develop 10 design considerations to facilitate the effective design, implementation, and adaptation of an impact assessment template for use in industry research settings and beyond, as well as our own "Societal Impact Assessment" template with concrete scaffolds. We explore the effectiveness of this template through a user study with 15 industry research interns, revealing both its strengths and limitations. Finally, we discuss the implications for future researchers, organizations, and policymakers seeking to foster more responsible research practices.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the feasibility of using video-passthrough Extended Reality (XR) devices to support communication in nonspeaking autistic individuals. Prior XR research with this population has relied on expensive augmented reality headsets and limited interactions to near-hand tapping. We present LetterBox, a novel application developed for video-passthrough XR headsets such as the Meta Quest series, which enables spelling through a “grab-snap-release” interaction. The app supports three immersion levels and includes a dynamic pass-through window tracking caregiver presence. We conducted a study with 19 participants across four sites in North America. All participants completed a multiphase spelling task and answered open-ended questions using LetterBox. Despite concerns about tolerability, all participants wore the headset throughout the session, with only one requesting a break. Participants achieved a mean spelling accuracy of ( 90.91% ). In the open-spelling task, 14 participants provided answers, often independently and with minimal support. Reaction time and interaction speed data highlight the influence of visual complexity, offering insights for designing interfaces that reduce errors and improve speed. Our findings show that video-passthrough XR can be tolerated by nonspeakers and that the grab-snap-release method offers a promising alternative to tapping, particularly for those with significant motor control challenges. By leveraging affordable hardware, a novel interaction method, and progressive immersion, this study reveals important findings and opens new pathways to inclusive assistive technologies for this under-served population.},

However, medication or dietary supplements non-adherence is a challenge, as are risks of misuse, abuse, and diversion (MAD). Due to the increased prevalence of progressive deficits in cognition among community-dwelling older adults, the ability to plan, organize, and execute medicine-management behaviors is further compromised, leading to an increased risk of unintentional non-adherence, medication errors, and preventable medication-related hospitalizations. HUG Smart Sticker is a personalized intelligent medication management system promoting informed and safe medication usage for community-dwelling older adults. This Artificial Intelligent of Things (AIoT) intervention records users’ medication usage in real-time, reports the latest alerts or potential side effects, and reminds users to ensure the safe usage of medications.

While the viewpoints of policymakers and academics are frequently published (and often contradictory), less is known about the views of those on the ground. In this paper we ask: What are energy professionals’ views of digital energy-saving interventions and their users? What are the challenges they face implementing these interventions? Based on a university campus case study with twelve semi-structured interviews and a focus group with energy and facilities’ professionals, we illustrate how they strongly advocate digital efficiency as a pathway to sustainability; yet, this optimism is in apparent tension with key barriers they identify to realising ‘their seamless visions’, particularly the complexities of the human behaviour they are seeking to optimise. These findings underscore the seductiveness of techno-optimism and the need for more systemic change.},

abstract = {To address security vulnerabilities arising from third-party libraries, security researchers maintain databases monitoring and curating vulnerability reports. Application developers can identify libraries affected by vulnerability reports (in short, affected libraries) by directly querying the databases with their used libraries. However, the querying results of affected libraries are not reliable due to the incompleteness of vulnerability reports. Thus, current approaches model the task of identifying affected libraries as a named-entity-recognition (NER) task or an extreme multi-label learning (XML) task. These approaches suffer from highly inaccurate results in identifying affected libraries with complex and similar names, e.g., Java libraries. To address these limitations, in this article, we propose VulLibMiner, the first to identify affected libraries from textual descriptions of both vulnerabilities and libraries, together with VulLib, a Java vulnerability dataset with their affected libraries. VulLibMiner consists of a TF-IDF matcher to efficiently screen out a small set of candidate libraries and a BERT-FNN model to effectively identify affected libraries from these candidates. We evaluate VulLibMiner using four state-of-the-art/practice approaches of identifying affected libraries on both their dataset named VeraJava and our VulLib dataset. Our evaluation results show that VulLibMiner can effectively identify affected libraries with an average F1 score of 0.669 while the state-of-the-art/practice approaches achieve only 0.547.},

year = {2025},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) allows visualizations to be situated where they are relevant, e.g., in a robot's operating environment or task space. Yet, headset-based AR suffers a scalability issue because every viewer must wear a headset. Projector-based spatial AR solves this problem by projecting augmentations onto the scene, e.g., recognized objects or navigation paths, viewable to crowds. However, this solution mostly requires vertical flat surfaces that may not exist in large open areas like auditoriums, warehouses, construction sites, or search and rescue scenes. Moreover, when humans are not co-located with the robot or situated at a distance, the projection may not be legible to humans. Thus, there is a need to create a projectable, viewable surface for humans in such scenarios.In this HRI systems paper, we introduce a fog screen-robot system that integrates a mid-air fog screen device into a robot to create such a projectable surface and presents two evaluations in a construction site and a search and rescue scenario for high-stakes communication needs. Specifically, we implemented an existing fog screen device, which can only project one-third of a meter (33cm). We improved it to achieve a fog screen length of half a meter (53cm). In the noisy construction site scenario, the robot inspected the site and projected icons for missing wall sockets and plumbing fixtures. In the unstructured search and rescue scenario, the robot was able to project a person icon for a first responder to save life.

Although such automated in situ tasks suffice for many real-world applications, we demonstrate that a complementary interactive interface can significantly boost scientific productivity. We show through two use cases how our approach enables scientists to pause simulations and make interactive adjustments between timesteps. This method eliminates cold restart overhead, accelerating setup, troubleshooting, and exploration.},

abstract = {VR simulation in Health Professions (HP) education demonstrates huge potential, but fixed learning content with little customization limits its application beyond lab environments. To address these limitations in the context of VR for patient communication training, we conducted a user-centered study involving semi-structured interviews with advanced HP students to understand their challenges in clinical communication training and perceptions of VR-based solutions. From this, we derived design insights emphasizing the importance of realistic scenarios, simple interactions, and unpredictable dialogues. Building on these insights, we developed the Virtual AI Patient Simulator (VAPS), a novel VR system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs), supporting dynamic and customizable patient interactions for immersive learning. We also provided an example of how clinical professors could use user-friendly design forms to create personalized scenarios that align with course objectives in VAPS and discuss future implications of integrating AI-driven technologies into VR education.},

abstract = {The Node.js ecosystem, with its growing popularity and increasing exposure to security vulnerabilities, has a pressing need for more effective security analysis tools. To reduce false positives, recent works on detecting vulnerabilities in Node.js packages have developed synthesis algorithms to generate proof-of-concept exploits. However, these tools focus mainly on vulnerabilities that can be triggered by a single direct call to an exported function of the analyzed package, failing to generate exploits that require more complex interactions. In this paper, we present Explode.js, the first tool capable of synthesizing exploits that include complex call sequences to trigger vulnerabilities in Node.js packages. By combining static analysis and symbolic execution, Explode.js generates functional exploits that confirm the existence of command, code injection, prototype pollution, and path traversal vulnerabilities, effectively eliminating false positives. The results of evaluating Explode.js on two state-of-the-art datasets of Node.js packages with confirmed vulnerabilities show that it generates significantly more exploits than its main competitor tools. Furthermore, when applied to real-world Node.js packages, Explode.js uncovered 44 zero-day vulnerabilities, with 4 new CVEs.},

Individualized voice goals guide and motivate the voice training journey, but existing voice training technologies fail to define clear goals. We interviewed six voice experts and ten transgender individuals with voice training experience (voice trainees), focusing on how they defined, triangulated, and used voice goals. We found that goal voice exploration involves navigation between descriptive and technical goals, and continuous reevaluation throughout the voice training journey. Our study reveals how goal descriptions, subjective satisfaction, voice examples, and voice modification and training technologies inform goal exploration, and identifies risks of overemphasizing goals. We identified technological implications informed by existing expert and trainee strategies, and provide guidelines for supporting individualized goals throughout the voice training journey based on brainstorming with trainees and experts.},

abstract = {Internet of Things-enabled home automation is starting to significantly transform our daily lives. Users must be able to configure and coordinate the connected objects in their dwellings to personalise and fully benefit from their potentialities. Trigger-action programming is one relevant approach to enable users to create useful automations. However, current approaches mainly based on visual Web or mobile interfaces have limitations, such as the difficulty in finding and selecting the correct object and associated services. Mobile augmented reality is an interaction modality that can support more direct and usable automation control. In this perspective, the support of a recommendation system can facilitate users in creating personalised automations. This paper presents a system for generating personalised daily automations recommendations and presenting them in a mobile augmented reality solution in order to facilitate their monitoring and creation. Seven classification approaches were assessed on different datasets to determine their ability to provide personalised and context-aware recommendations. We also report a user study (N = 16) showing that the personalised recommendation system improves user performance when creating automations in a trigger action format with a mobile augmented reality editing environment.},

Our analysis revealed how routines helped people adapt to videoconferencing constraints, how participants navigated disruptions to their videoconferencing routines, and the kinds of routines that were more challenging to manage when faced disruptions. In the discussion, we describe why routines are particularly important to study and support for people with cognitive concerns, the importance of studying older adults’ routines to support technology use in HCI, and methods that can enrich HCI research by uncovering insights into routines.},

Teens had preconceived notions of different platforms and navigated boundaries based on specific goals; yet, they struggled when platforms lacked the granular controls needed to meet their needs. Teens enjoyed the personalization afforded by algorithms, but they felt violated when algorithms pushed unwanted content. Teens designed features for enhanced control over their discoverability and for real-time risk detection to avoid boundary turbulence. We provide design guidelines for improved social media boundary management for youth and pinpoint educational opportunities to enhance teens’ understanding and use of social media privacy settings and algorithms.},

We found that users sought customizable, reconfigurable, multifunctional, and more aesthetically pleasing mobility aids. Participants’ feedback guided our prototyping of tools/accessories, such as laser cut decorative sleeves, hot-swappable physical interface modules, and modular canes with custom 3D-printed handles. These prototypes were then the focus of additional co-design sessions where six returning participants offered suggestions for improvements and provided feedback on their usefulness and usability. Our findings highlight that many mobility aid users have the desire, ability, and need to customize and improve their aids in different ways compared to older adults.

Despite its popularity, OnlyFans possesses key limitations that lead creators to other social media platforms for self-promotion and audience building. This study explores the self-promotion strategies and context collapse management among adult content creators on OnlyFans. Through semi-structured qualitative interviews with 15 OnlyFans creators, we investigated their approaches to self-promotion, audience growth, and boundary management among different social media platforms. OnlyFans creators face unique challenges compared to other creators due to the stigma associated with adult content and digital sex work. Our findings reveal the unique strategies they employ to navigate the constraints of their work in tandem with maintaining boundaries to avoid context collapse. This research contributes to a broader understanding of the nuances of impression management within under-researched, stigmatized online communities.

This paper addresses this issue by proposing a cross-platform network identity recognition technique based on multi-dimensional information fusion. The proposed method combines users’ feature information from various social media platforms with the structural information of social networks to identify the same user across different platforms through feature similarity and cross-layer link prediction. First, we construct multi-dimensional feature vectors of users based on usernames, profile pictures, interest tags, and other attributes, and then apply machine learning algorithms to analyze these vectors and generate candidate sets for identity matching. Second, by employing node embedding techniques, we model user accounts in multi-layer social networks and further leverage network structure information to enhance the accuracy of cross-platform identity recognition. The proposed method effectively addresses the complexity arising from the diversity of virtual identities and provides strong support for user behavior analysis and identity identification in cybercrime investigations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach exhibits high accuracy and robustness across multiple datasets.},

abstract = {Creative writing is a deeply human craft, yet AI systems using large language models (LLMs) offer the automation of significant parts of the writing process. So why do some creative writers choose to use AI? Through interviews and observed writing sessions with 18 creative writers who already use AI regularly in their writing practice, we find that creative writers are intentional about how they incorporate AI, making many deliberate decisions about when and how to engage AI based on their core values, such as authenticity and craftsmanship. We characterize the interplay between writers’ values, their fluid relationships with AI, and specific integration strategies—ultimately enabling writers to create new AI workflows without compromising their creative values. We provide insight for writing communities, AI developers and future researchers on the importance of supporting transparency of these emerging writing processes and rethinking what AI features can best serve writers.},

abstract = {Scientific workflows have become highly heterogenous, leveraging distributed facilities such as High Performance Computing (HPC), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), scientific instruments (data-driven pipelines) and edge computing. As a result, Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Cybersecurity challenges across the diverse hardware and software stacks are growing. Nevertheless, scientific productivity relies on lowering access barriers via seamless, single sign-on (SSO) and federated login while ensuring access controls and compliance. We present an implementation of a federated IAM solution, which is coupled with multiple layers of security controls, multi-factor authentication, cloud-native protocols, and time-limited role-based access controls (RBAC) that has been co-designed and deployed for the Isambard-AI and HPC supercomputing Digital Research Infrastructures (DRIs) in the UK. Isambard DRIs as a national research resource are expected to comply with regulatory frameworks. Implementation details for monitoring, alerting and controls are outlined in the paper alongside selected user stories for demonstrating IAM workflows for different roles.},

Current fintech support for older adults, notably delegation to close others, inadequately accommodates their cognitive strengths and life transitions. To envision fintech support for age-related cognitive diversity in a rapidly changing fintech landscape, we engaged 17 older adults, five family members, and five professionals in co-creating and critiquing personas, scenarios, and design concepts through interviews and group discussions. Our thematic analysis uncovers interrelated social factors and financial management collaborations across inner and outer circles, highlighting the importance of preparedness for transitions, long-term safeguarding, and short-term fail-safes. From these insights, we propose design avenues for layered fintech support networks across close and distant others, situated meta-design for mutual fintech support, and personalized fintech “first aid.” We urge HCI communities to collectively design holistic approaches to a fintech support ecosystem for aging and accessibility.},

abstract = {Responsible AI (rAI) guidance increasingly promotes stakeholder involvement (SHI) during AI development. At the same time, SHI is already common in commercial software development, but with potentially different foci. This study clarifies the extent to which established SHI practices are able to contribute to rAI efforts as well as potential disconnects – essential insights to inform and tailor future interventions that further shift industry practice towards rAI efforts. First, we analysed 56 rAI guidance documents to identify why SHI is recommended (i.e. its expected benefits for rAI) and uncovered goals such as redistributing power, improving socio-technical understandings, anticipating risks, and enhancing public oversight. To understand why and how SHI is currently practised in commercial settings, we then conducted an online survey (n=130) and semi-structured interviews (n=10) with AI practitioners. Our findings reveal that SHI in practice is primarily driven by commercial priorities (e.g. customer value, compliance) and several factors currently discourage more rAI-aligned SHI practices. This suggests that established SHI practices are largely not contributing to rAI efforts. Towards addressing this disconnect, we propose interventions and research opportunities to advance SHI for rAI development in real-world practice.},

Voice spoofing, where artificial voices are generated to impersonate real individuals, is a growing concern in various domains, including online communication, authentication, and social media interactions. This paper uses deep learning techniques to present a forensic investigation into the detection of synthetic voice spoofing within social apps. This study integrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) in a hybrid architecture. A lightweight MobileNet CNN first extracts spatial features from Mel-Spectrograms, which are then analyzed by the TCN to capture sequential patterns. Using the fake-or-real (FoR) dataset, the for-norm dataset, this model achieved a training precision of 99.89% and validation accuracy of 99.79% and for-rerec dataset the model achieved a training precision of 99.79% and validation accuracy of 94.22%. Evaluation metrics, including the precision-recall curve with an average precision of 99% and the ROC curve with an AUC of 99%, underscore the model's robustness in distinguishing real from synthetic audio, offering a reliable solution for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments.},

Keeping survey articles current with the latest evidence is therefore desirable, though there is a limited understanding of why, when, and how these surveys should be updated. Toward this end, through a series of in-depth retrospective interviews with 11 researchers, we present an empirical examination of the work practices in authoring and updating survey articles in computing research. We find that while computing researchers acknowledge the value in maintaining an updated survey, continuous updating remains unmanageable and misaligned with academic incentives. Our findings suggest key leverage points within current workflows that present opportunities for enabling technologies to facilitate more efficient and effective updates.},

To address this, we designed a collaborative online storytelling experience in social VR, enabling participants in isolation to design an imaginary space journey as a metaphor for quarantine, in order to learn about their isolation adaptation strategies in the process. Eighteen individuals participated during real quarantine undertaken a virtual role-play experience, designing their own spaceship rooms and engaging in collaborative activities that revealed creative adaptative strategies. Qualitative analyses of participant designs, transcripts, and interactions revealed how they coped with isolation, and how the engagement unexpectedly influenced their adaptation process. This study shows how designing playful narrative experiences, rather than solution-driven approaches, can serve as probes to surface how people navigate social isolation.},

Drawing from 450K model cards and 600 real-world incidents, RiskRAG pre-populates contextualized risk reports. A preliminary study with 50 developers showed that they preferred RiskRAG over standard model cards, as it better met all the design requirements. A final study with 38 developers, 40 designers, and 37 media professionals showed that RiskRAG improved their way of selecting the AI model for a specific application, encouraging a more careful and deliberative decision-making.

Polyglot files pose a problem for file-upload and generative AI web interfaces that rely on format identification to determine how to securely handle incoming files. In this work we found that existing file-format and embedded-file detection tools, even those developed specifically for polyglot files, fail to reliably detect polyglot files used in the wild. To address this issue, we studied the use of polyglot files by malicious actors in the wild, finding 30 polyglot samples and 15 attack chains that leveraged polyglot files. Using knowledge from our survey of polyglot usage in the wild---the first of its kind---we created a novel data set based on adversary techniques. We then trained a machine learning detection solution, PolyConv, using this data set. PolyConv achieves a precision-recall area-under-curve score of 0.999 with an F1 score of 99.20% for polyglot detection and 99.47% for file-format identification, significantly outperforming all other tools tested. We developed a content disarmament and reconstruction tool, ImSan, that successfully sanitized 100% of the tested image-based polyglots, which were the most common type found via the survey. Our work provides concrete tools and suggestions to enable defenders to better defend themselves against polyglot files, as well as directions for future work to create more robust file specifications and methods of disarmament.},

These gaps make us say that the policy knot - that entangles policy, practice, and design - broke. To understand why, we studied the biography of the certified HIS and identified that it is based on the practice of general medicine only. Without simply concluding that public policy has failed because of the system's shortcomings, we reveal the human effort involved in compensating for the HIS's inability to support the articulation work required for multi-professional coordination. Based on this empirical contribution, we offer the policy-oriented technological frame as a concept to make sense of IT in public health, and the congruence loop as a guideline to avoid the breakage of a policy knot.},

One emergent type of moderation action for maintaining mutual aid spaces on the Fediverse is the use of community boundary blocklists, which we define as shared lists of Fediverse servers intended to be imported as a common blocklist. However, the use of community boundary blocklists has incited conflict on the Fediverse, with many users left cut off from their communities and sources of support due to actions outside of their control. Using an approach rooted in constructivist grounded theory, we interviewed nine Fediverse users, including a mix of community boundary blocklist curators, server staff, and regular users, to determine key tensions between community moderation and mutual aid practices. From our interviews, we identify the novel perspective of community stewardship as an act of mutual aid. We extend existing collective action and mutual aid frameworks to understand why this perspective conflicts with more typical mutual aid activities. We also observe how federation as a protocol encodes a negative form of consent, allowing users to interact by default and individuals to consent for their entire instance, leading to consent violations. From these insights, we develop a series of community-sourced suggestions for Fediverse platform designers, blocklist curators, and community staff to help address these conflicts and protect marginalized users.},

abstract = {Industry actors in the United States have gained extensive influence in conversations about the regulation of generalpurpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Although industry participation is an important part of the policy process, it can also cause regulatory capture, whereby industry co-opts regulatory regimes to prioritize private over public welfare. Capture of AI policy by AI developers and deployers could hinder such regulatory goals as ensuring the safety, fairness, beneficence, transparency, or innovation of general-purpose AI systems. In this paper, we first introduce different models of regulatory capture from the social science literature. We then present results from interviews with 17 AI policy experts on what policy outcomes could compose regulatory capture in US AI policy, which AI industry actors are influencing the policy process, and whether and how AI industry actors attempt to achieve outcomes of regulatory capture. Experts were primarily concerned with capture leading to a lack of AI regulation, weak regulation, or regulation that over-emphasizes certain policy goals over others. Experts most commonly identified agenda-setting (15 of 17 interviews), advocacy (13), academic capture (10), information management (9), cultural capture through status (7), and media capture (7) as channels for industry influence. To mitigate these particular forms of industry influence, we recommend systemic changes in developing technical expertise in government and civil society, independent funding streams for the AI ecosystem, increased transparency and ethics requirements, greater civil society access to policy, and various procedural safeguards.},

abstract = {Social anxiety (SA) has become increasingly prevalent. Traditional coping strategies often face accessibility challenges. Generative AI (GenAI), known for their knowledgeable and conversational capabilities, are emerging as alternative tools for mental well-being. With the increased integration of GenAI, it is important to examine individuals’ attitudes and trust in GenAI chatbots’ support for SA. Through a mixed-method approach that involved surveys (n = 159) and interviews (n = 17), we found that individuals with severe symptoms tended to trust and embrace GenAI chatbots more readily, valuing their non-judgmental support and perceived emotional comprehension. However, those with milder symptoms prioritized technical reliability. We identified factors influencing trust, such as GenAI chatbots’ ability to generate empathetic responses and its context-sensitive limitations, which were particularly important among individuals with SA. We also discuss the design implications and use of GenAI chatbots in fostering cognitive and emotional trust, with practical and design considerations.},

However, disparities between the robot’s form and the teleoperator’s representation cause perceptual conflict in on-site users, degrading interaction quality. We introduce AvatARoid, a novel design that bridges this embodiment gap by superimposing the teleoperator’s motion-mapped AR avatar overlay on a humanoid. We evaluated our design in a mixed-method study (n=48) using an immersive simulation where participants interacted with a confederate teleoperator, presented in either (a) a humanoid robot, (b) a humanoid robot with video, or (c) AvatARoid. Results suggest AvatARoid significantly improved teleoperator embodiment for on-site users, particularly enhancing co-location, and control perceptions, and providing richer non-verbal gestures. In contrast, video and baseline conditions often resulted in a pronounced disconnect between the teleoperator and the robot for on-site users. Our study offers new insights into designing novel teleoperator representations to promote social interaction in robot-mediated telepresence.},

This question becomes especially critical in longer-term participatory research with low-resourced communities. This paper offers methodological reflections on a collaboration with a Men’s Shed that was tailored around both my research agenda and the interests of my community partner. As part of my research, we designed a booklet that eventually became their promotion brochure. By reviewing both the trouble and the gains of this process for both partners, I argue for re-imagining community-based participatory research as an opportunity for fostering give-and-take relationships with participants. The case demonstrates the method’s capacity to critically extend existing HCI work on Men’s Sheds while also making participation worthwhile for my partners. The careful documentation of this process contributes methodological nuance to discussions around configuring participation.},

This study investigates the addictive potential of AI chatbots by leveraging known addiction mechanisms to identify dark addiction patterns present in these systems. We conducted a literature review on dopamine’s role in addiction, followed by a UI evaluation of popular AI chatbots. The findings reveal four dark addiction patterns: non-deterministic responses, immediate and visual presentation of responses, notifications, and empathetic and agreeable responses. By extending the dopamine theory of addiction to AI chatbots and critically analyzing their design, this study aims to raise awareness of these risks and motivate potential interventions.},

abstract = {In recent years, the increase in ransomware attacks has significantly impacted individuals and organizations. Many strategies have been proposed to detect ransomware’s file disruption operation. However, they rely on certain assumptions that gradually fail in the face of evolving ransomware attacks, which use more stealthy encryption methods or benign-imitation-based I/O orchestration.  To mitigate this, we propose an approach to detect ransomware attacks through temporal correlation between encryption and I/O behaviors. Its key idea is that there is a strong temporal correlation inherent in ransomware’s encryption and I/O behaviors. To disrupt files, ransomware must first read the file data from the disk into memory, encrypt it, and then write the encrypted data back to the disk. This process creates a pronounced temporal correlation between the computation load of the encryption operations and the size of the files being encrypted. Based on this invariant, we implement a prototype called RansomRadar and evaluate its effectiveness against 411 latest ransomware samples from 89 families. Experimental results show that it achieves a detection rate of 100.00% with 2.68% false alarms. Its F1-score is 96.03, higher than the existing detectors for 31.82 on average.},

HCI research has focused on leveraging sensing technology to bridge gaps in remote interactions. In this work, we investigate the values and risks of integrating sensing technology in remote psychotherapy, specifically to capture and interpret non-verbal cues, by conducting a speculative design study with both clients and therapists. Our findings reveal that sensing technology has the potential to facilitate self-reflection in therapy. The sharing of tracked non-verbal cues could also possibly foster mutual disclosure, supporting therapists' judgments and balancing power dynamics between clients and therapists. However, clients and therapists were concerned about the accuracy of sensing systems, potential privacy threats, and additional cognition burden. Our insights into system values imply how sensing technology could potentially balance power dynamics in client-therapist relationships as well as general interpersonal relationships. We also emphasize the increased considerations in sensing-technology-empowered communication for remote psychotherapy than in non-vulnerable settings.},

Extensive research in making T2I models produce hyper-realistic images has led to new concerns, such as generating Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) web content and polluting the web society. To help prevent misuse of T2I models and create a safer web environment for users features like NSFW filters and post-hoc security checks are used in these models. However, recent work unveiled how these methods can easily fail to prevent misuse. In particular, adversarial attacks on text and image modalities can easily outplay defensive measures. %Exploiting such leads to the growing concern of preventing adversarial attacks on text and image modalities. Moreover, there is currently no robust multimodal NSFW dataset that includes both prompt and image pairs and adversarial examples. This work proposes a million-scale prompt and image dataset generated using open-source diffusion models. Second, we develop a multimodal defense to distinguish safe and NSFW text and images, which is robust against adversarial attacks and directly alleviates current challenges. Our extensive experiments show that our model performs well against existing SOTA NSFW detection methods in terms of accuracy and recall, drastically reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) in multimodal adversarial attack scenarios.

As a mixed-abilities team, we investigated student experiences with GenAI tools by collecting survey and interview responses from 62 and 21 students with disabilities, respectively, across two universities to measure students’ use of GenAI tools and their perspectives on the impact of these tools in ways related to disability, university support, and sense of belonging. Despite concerns over potential risks of GenAI and unclear university policies, students described GenAI tools as a useful resource for personalizing learning, promoting self-care, and assisting with important self-advocacy work. Guidance demonstrating safe, acceptable uses of GenAI tools, along with clear policies and resources that acknowledge diverse student needs, were desired. We discuss implications of these tools for accessibility and inclusion in higher education.},

To bridge this research gap through computer simulation, we introduce a cyberattack campaign designer that enables modelers to construct cyberattack campaigns. This tool allows modelers to define how the process or pattern of the cyberattack campaign can change based on the cybercriminal's personality and simulates how these personality differences influence the magnitude of cyberattack damage on the target organization. In this paper, through computer simulation, we demonstrate how cautious and reckless personalities result in variations in the cyberattack pattern and, consequently, affect the magnitude of cyberattack damage, despite identical cyberattack objectives and techniques used at each step.},

abstract = {Background. In modern software development, the use of external libraries and packages is increasingly prevalent, streamlining the software development process and enabling developers to deploy feature-rich systems with little coding. While this reliance on reusing code offers substantial benefits, it also introduces serious risks for deployed software in the form of malicious packages -harmful and vulnerable code disguised as useful libraries. Aims. Popular ecosystems, such PyPI, receive thousands of new package contributions every week, and distinguishing safe contributions from harmful ones presents a significant challenge. There is a dire need for reliable methods to detect and address the presence of malicious packages in these environments. Method. To address these challenges, we propose a data-driven approach that uses machine learning and static analysis to examine the package's metadata, code, files, and textual characteristics to identify malicious packages. Results. In evaluations conducted within the PyPI ecosystem, we achieved an F1-measure of 0.94 for identifying malicious packages using a stacking ensemble classifier. Conclusions. This tool can be seamlessly integrated into package vetting pipelines and has the capability to flag entire packages, not just malicious function calls. This enhancement strengthens security measures and reduces the manual workload for developers and registry maintainers, thereby contributing to the overall integrity of the ecosystem.},

Current frameworks supporting designers in this task primarily focus on specific well-being objectives, such as goal-setting or self-reflection, but often lack implementable design recommendations to enhance engagement and prevent lapsing. To address this gap, we propose the Self-Care Technology Process Model (SCTpm), which builds on six prior studies on VR self-care applications. The SCTpm is a framework for an intervention-centred self-care journey, providing targeted design recommendations tailored to evolving user needs and supporting sustained interaction. Evaluated by n=10 experts, the SCTpm demonstrates its potential to enhance the iterative design and evaluation cycles of VR-based self-care technologies, sensitising designers to create effective and more engaging systems. Findings further indicate that the SCTpm can provide valuable guidance for designers and researchers at different levels of expertise in developing innovative VR applications for self-care.},

Before the introduction of these policies in 2019, trans, non-binary, and gender diverse authors faced significant barriers, often risking privacy violations and disruptions to their academic records. This study employs thematic content analysis to assess the publicly available name change policies of nine academic journal publishers, examining their structure, discoverability, and alignment with inclusivity principles. Key findings reveal a lack of standardization across policies, with notable variation in content and accessibility. While privacy and correction mechanisms are commonly addressed, critical themes such as author engagement and broader industry context remain underdeveloped. The policies’ discoverability on publisher websites also varies widely, potentially limiting their utility to those who need them most. These gaps highlight covert marginalization embedded in policy design and communication. By situating this analysis within an ethic of care and the broader context of digital identity management, this study reveals how publishing policies intersect with web-based systems of scholarly communication. The findings urge academic publishers, technologists, and policymakers to co-create inclusive solutions that align with emerging metadata standards and ethical frameworks. This research lays a foundation for understanding how academic infrastructure can evolve to better serve diverse author communities in a connected and equitable web ecosystem.},

abstract = {Aiming to address the issue of traditional encrypted network traffic identification models' shortcomings in feature extraction and the use of separate models for traffic characterization and application identification in encrypted traffic classification, which makes network management more difficult. Here, a Transformer-1DCNN-ECA-based multi-task encrypted traffic categorization model is suggested. First, the dataset is cut, filled, and normalized to increase the classification accuracy; next, the Transformer model's multi-head attention mechanism is used to capture long-distance feature dependencies and finish extracting global feature information; finally, 1DCNN is used to extract local features; Lastly, the network becomes more focused on important features with the addition of a lightweight ECA module, which enhances model performance and enables multi-task encrypted traffic categorization. The average accuracy of this model on ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset for traffic feature and application identification classification is 97.97% and 98.27%, which is better than other models.},

In contrast, health coaching offers highly personalized support but can be prohibitively expensive and inaccessible. This study draws inspiration from health coaching to explore how large language models (LLMs) might address personalization challenges in mobile health. We conduct formative interviews with 12 health professionals and 10 potential coaching recipients to develop design principles for an LLM-based health coach. We then built GPTCoach, a chatbot that implements the onboarding conversation from an evidence-based coaching program, uses conversational strategies from motivational interviewing, and incorporates wearable data to create personalized physical activity plans. In a lab study with 16 participants using three months of historical data, we find promising evidence that GPTCoach gathers rich qualitative information to offer personalized support, with users feeling comfortable sharing concerns. We conclude with implications for future research on LLM-based physical activity support.},

abstract = {Online games increasingly rely on AI moderation systems that employ punitive approaches despite player dissatisfaction with these methods. This paper investigates how metaphorical frameworks can inform alternative approaches to AI moderation in gaming spaces. Through four co-design workshops with 16 online game players and AI experts, we explored how stakeholders conceptualise AI moderation beyond traditional punitive metaphors like ‘police officer’ or ‘enforcer’. We present three spotlight designs from these workshops based on the metaphors of the ‘all-seeing eye’, ‘non-player character/NPC’, and ‘cleaner’. Participants’ designs highlighted numerous unexplored applications of AI in the moderation space, including interface and game integration, educational opportunities, and assistive potential. At the same time, these alternative moderation systems raised new challenges and ethical concerns. Drawing from our findings, we present three future design and research avenues for alternative AI-driven moderation in online games, reflecting on potential opportunities and challenges.},

How technology designers come to prioritize certain groups while overlooking others is a question with real implications for design. We rely on psychological theories of prototypicality to characterize the “gendered persona,’’ or the gender identity that comes spontaneously to mind when considering users. We conduct three studies including both non-expert convenience samples and expert samples of participants with technology design experience, exploring the gendered persona across populations and a range of technologies. We find that people are more likely to spontaneously describe users as men (across several technologies), whereas women are largely overlooked. Men represent the “prototypical user,’’ a cultural stereotype shared by both non-experts and experts from populations whose stereotypes could impact real design decisions.},

Using web applications for tourism is not unheard of; Pampanga's tourism website is limited to a simple tab on its outdated provincial website and a tab on another site. The main goal of this study is to develop a web application that uses gamification mechanics to encourage users to visit Pampanga, Philippines. The study applied the Iterative Waterfall Model. Considering the feedback from peers from the same study and targeted individuals from the modified GUESS-18 survey and Google's PageSpeedInsight was vital. In summary, Bale found a 6.15 usability rating and a 5.96 social connectivity rating through GUESS-18. Bale successfully implemented gamified mechanics like a point system, leaderboard, and social cooperation, to enhance usability and disseminate cultural information to users about Pampanga through gamified food tourism.},

abstract = {The adoption of FPGA instances by major cloud service providers (CSPs) reflects the growing demand for accelerated and heterogeneous computing across various applications, e.g., AI. To improve the efficiency, utilization and virtualization, multi-tenant FPGAs allow multiple users to utilize FPGA resources concurrently, with each FPGA partition assigned to a separate tenant. However, this introduces significant security vulnerabilities, such as the potential for attacks by configuring a malicious circuit in one tenant's FPGA partition. One notable vulnerability is disrupting the FPGA's power distribution network, leading to faults or even crashing the entire FPGA, affecting other tenants. Usually, such an attack requires a considerable amount of resources. A naive solution would be splitting an FPGA into smaller fractions to reduce the potential for successful Power-Hammering by individual tenants and enhance the security. However, our paper demonstrates that even with smaller fractions per tenant, attacks can still occur. We propose the threat of coordinated attacks, where malicious tenants use an unintended covert channel between them. We practically validate this threat in a real cloud computing environment by introducing a synchronized and coordinated power-hammering attack from multiple malicious tenants. These tenants synchronize their actions using a voltage-based covert channel. Our results reveal the success of the attack, surpassing state-of-the-art countermeasures and detection mechanisms with a success rate exceeding 90%, compared to 30% for uncoordinated attacks.},

abstract = {The goal of this work is to support forensic procedures and models in attribution by demonstrating how the categorization and characterization of attackers or attacker groups, who use steganographic text channels to embed stegomalware, can be effectively supported through the visualization of embeddings. The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence are expected to significantly simplify and enhance the use of covert channels in text, making the visualization of embeddings an essential and indispensable component. Only by effectively detecting and clearly presenting steganographic embeddings can the characterization and categorization of such activities be performed meaningfully and accurately.To achieve this, embeddings from various steganographic algorithms were analyzed, and requirements for their visualization were developed. These requirements emphasize clarity, interpretability, and measurable outcomes. Based on these criteria, the visualization methods for different steganographic techniques were optimized to ensure that embeddings are not only easily recognizable but also straightforward to interpret. This process also highlights the importance of making such visualizations accessible and applicable in practical forensic scenarios.As a result, this research presents a specialized tool capable of detecting embeddings across multiple algorithms and displaying them in an interpretable and understandable way. This tool simplifies the analysis of texts containing steganographic embeddings. In some cases, the tool even makes it possible to visualize the embeddings in the first place. It further facilitates the characterization and categorization of attackers and their strategies, thereby contributing to more effective attribution in the context of cyber forensics.},

abstract = {SMS phishing (aka 'smishing') threats have grown to be a serious concern for mobile users around the globe. In cases of successful smishing, attackers take advantage of users' trust through deceptive text messages to trick them into downloading malicious content, disclosing private information, or becoming victims of fraud. Current studies on smishing mostly focus on the classification of smishing (or spam) messages from benign ones as a means of defense. However, there is no systematic study to characterizing smishing threats and their landscapes by which we can monitor the ongoing campaigns from a bird's-eye perspective to apply effective defense. In this paper, we propose SmishViz, a graph-based visualization system that can aid defenders (i.e., analysts) to characterize ongoing smishing threats in the wild and allow them to monitor the connected campaigns and campaign-operations through effective graph visualization approach integrated with state-of-the-art open-source visualization tool. This paper also provides case study with real-world smishing dataset to showcase the efficacy of SmishViz system in practical use-case scenarios. Our case study results reveal that the proposed system can certainly help defenders to track and monitor ongoing smishing campaigns, understand attackers' tactics to formulate strategic defense and uproot the attack operations.},

During the dialogues, participants discussed what a desirable future in light of genAI development could look like in one of three contexts: education, public service, and arts &amp; culture. Participants explored the consequences of technology deployment, assessed the risks, mapped stakeholders, and derived measures to achieve a desirable goal. This study contributes to policy debates on genAI by providing recommendations derived from participants’ identified requirements and suggested measures for genAI to create value and to foster a socially desirable future.

Through video review, we identified causes for PPE noncompliance, activities that were frequently performed without PPE, instances in which PPE was intentionally removed, and mechanisms by which healthcare providers corrected PPE noncompliance. We also interviewed 18 registered nurses working in the hospital's emergency department (ED) and intensive care unit (ICU) to better understand observed PPE behaviors and practices. Our results suggest that alert design will require considering the urgency of correcting PPE noncompliance against the urgency of tasks being performed.

In the context of the Russia-Ukraine War, this question becomes more pressing, given the Russian government's extensive history of orchestrating information campaigns. We conducted an interview study with 13 expert Wikipedians involved in the Russo-Ukrainian War topic area on the English-language edition of Wikipedia. While our participants did not perceive there to be clear evidence of a state-backed information operation, they agreed that war-related articles experienced high levels of disruptive editing from both Russia-aligned and Ukraine-aligned accounts. The English-language edition of Wikipedia had existing policies and processes at its disposal to counter such disruption. State-backed or not, the disruptive activity created time-intensive maintenance work for our participants. Finally, participants considered English-language Wikipedia to be more resilient than social media in preventing the spread of false information online. We conclude by discussing sociotechnical implications for Wikipedia and social platforms.},

abstract = {In the face of intensified datafication and automation in public-sector industries, frameworks like design justice and the feminist practice of refusal provide help to identify and mitigate structural harm and challenge inequities reproduced in digitized infrastructures. This paper applies those frameworks to emerging efforts across the U.S. healthcare industry to automate prior authorization - a process whereby insurance companies determine whether a treatment or service is “medically necessary” before agreeing to cover it. Federal regulatory interventions turn to datafication and automation to reduce the harms of this widely unpopular process shown to delay vital treatments and create immense administrative burden for healthcare providers and patients. This paper explores emerging prior authorization reforms as a case study, applying the frameworks of design justice and refusal to highlight the inherent conservatism of interventions oriented towards improving the user experience of extractive systems. I further explore how the abolitionist framework of non-reformist reform helps to clarify alternative interventions that would mitigate the harms of prior authorization in ways that do not reproduce or extend the power of insurance companies. I propose a set of four tenets for non-reformist design to mitigate structural harms and advance design justice in a broad set of domains.},

Crafted for developing countries, where utilitarian travel heavily relies on motorcycles, the model integrates sociocultural factors that influence transport behavior. Multinomial models and inferential statistics applied to survey data from Cali, Colombia, inform the model, revealing significant influences of sociodemographic factors and travel attributes on mode choice. Findings highlight the importance of cost, time, safety, comfort, and personal security, with disparities across socioeconomic groups. Policy simulations demonstrate positive responses to interventions like free public transportation, increased bus frequency, and enhanced security, yet with modest shifts in mode choice. Multifaceted policy approaches are deemed more effective, addressing diverse user preferences. Outputs can be extended to cities with similar sociocultural characteristics and transport dynamics. The methodology applied in this work can be replicated for other regions.},

abstract = {The recent surge of research on software developer mental health challenges highlights the importance and urgency of studying solutions to support developer wellbeing. Self-Determination Theory (SDT) offers a valuable framework for exploring wellbeing at work, emphasizing the need to satisfy three psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. This paper presents an interview study with 31 software developers in the United States that uses SDT as a guide, exploring how these three needs are perceived and influenced in the work of software developers. We identify specific factors and processes at work and work tools and designs that impact developers’ psychological needs and satisfaction. Results from our study can help design targeted solutions to satisfy developers’ psychological needs, which indirectly support developer wellbeing. This paper highlights the necessity of healthy work cultures in software development and presents design considerations for creating tools for developers.},

abstract = {As our most advanced technologies, such as AI, become both infrastructural and opaque, experts must educate and engage the broader public. To that end, we developed an Augmented Reality (AR) museum installation about facial recognition and data collection that served both as a medium of public education and as a platform for collecting multiple different kinds of data—though, notably, not facial or other biometric data—from more than 100,000 museum visitors. We explain our design process through four animating tensions: comfort/discomfort, simplicity/complexity, neutrality/critique, and the individual/communal. Using thematic analysis of interviews and surveys, we draw insights on how people exposed to problematic technologies in a ‘safe space’ such as a museum make sense of these issues: with levity and resignation but also reverence, often specifically rooted in local cultures. We conclude with implications of the guiding principle derived from this work: “using problematic technology to teach about problematic technology.”},

abstract = {Web3's decentralised infrastructure has upended the standardised approach to digital identity established by protocols like OpenID Connect. Web2 and Web3 currently operate in silos, with Web2 leveraging selective disclosure JSON web tokens (SD-JWTs) and Web3 dApps being reliant on on-chain data and sometimes clinging to centralised system data. This fragmentation hinders user experience and the interconnectedness of the digital world. This paper explores the integration of Web3 within the OpenID Connect framework, scrutinising established authentication protocols for their adaptability to decentralised identities. The research examines the interplay between OpenID Connect and decentralised identity concepts, the limitations of existing protocols like OpenID Connect for verifiable credential issuance, OpenID Connect framework for verifiable presentations, and self-issued OpenID provider. As a result, a novel privacy-preserving digital identity bridge is proposed, which aims to answer the research question of whether authentication protocols should inherently support Web3 functionalities and the mechanisms for their integration. Through a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) use case, the findings indicate that a privacy-centric bridge can mitigate existing fragmentation by aggregating different identities to provide a better user experience. While the digital identity bridge demonstrates a possible approach to harmonise digital identity across platforms for their use in Web3, the bridging is unidirectional and limits root trust of credentials. The bridge's dependence on centralised systems may further fuel the debate on (de-)centralised identities.},

Aiming at the problems existing in system integration and the shortcomings of system integration methods, this paper puts forward an overall framework of enterprise integrated information system, which can better optimize information and business processes, improve information sharing, timeliness and completeness, and meet the continuous informatization needs of enterprises. Finally, the case study of A company provides theoretical and practical reference for the informatization system integration of Chinese enterprises.},

abstract = {Serious games, particularly board games, have long been employed in production management education to teach various concepts. While they have demonstrated educational effectiveness, their integration with emerging Industry 4.0 technologies remains limited. Furthermore, there is a lack of empirical research on how industry practitioners apply these digitization technologies in the workplace. To bridge this gap, we designed a course that integrates digital technologies into a traditional board game. We conducted two studies to evaluate both knowledge gains within the classroom and knowledge transfer back into the manufacturing industry. Our results show an improved understanding of the synergies between production management principles and Industry 4.0 technologies, as well as the real-world challenges students face when attempting to transfer this knowledge. Our work contributes pedagogical and practical perspectives on how technology-enhanced serious games can extend learning in and beyond the classroom.},

Through interviews with CHWs and their supervisors and log analysis, we examine factors affecting their engagement with ASHABot, and ASHABot’s role in addressing CHWs’ informational needs. We found that ASHABot provided a private channel for CHWs to ask rudimentary and sensitive questions they hesitated to ask supervisors. CHWs trusted the information they received on ASHABot and treated it as an authoritative resource. CHWs’ supervisors expanded their knowledge by contributing answers to questions ASHABot failed to answer, but were concerned about demands on their workload and increased accountability. We emphasize positioning LLMs as supplemental fallible resources within the community healthcare ecosystem, instead of as replacements for supervisor support.},

While athletes in other sporting contexts commonly use technology to improve their performance, no studies have explored how technology might benefit athletes with tetraplegia when training for adaptive competitive sports like TetraSki. We conducted semi-structured interviews with six TetraSki athletes and four tethers who participated in TetraSki Express 2022, the world’s first and only adaptive alpine ski competition for athletes with tetraplegia. Our study provides an in-depth understanding of athletes’ and tethers’ current practices and challenges while working to improve their performance in this competitive environment, and points to opportunities for self-tracking technologies to support their athletic endeavors better.},

abstract = {Vulnerability disclosure is critical for ensuring the security and reliability of open source software (OSS). However, in practice, many vulnerabilities are reported and discussed on public platforms before being formally disclosed, posing significant risks to vulnerability management. Inadequate vulnerability disclosure can expose users to security threats and severely impact the stability and reliability of software systems. For example, prior work shows that over 21% of CVEs are publicly discussed before a patch is released. Despite its importance, we still lack clarity on the vulnerability disclosure practices adopted by open source communities and the preferences of practitioners regarding vulnerability management. To fill this gap, we analyzed the vulnerability disclosure practices of 8,073 OSS projects spanning from 2017 to 2023. We then conducted an empirical study by surveying practitioners about their preferences and recommendations in vulnerability disclosure management. Finally, we compared the survey results with the actual vulnerability practice observed within the OSS projects. Our results show that while over 80% of practitioners support Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD), only 55% of vulnerabilities conform to CVD in practice. Although only 20% of practitioners advocate discussions before disclosure, 42% of vulnerabilities are discussed in issue reports before their disclosure. This study reveals the vulnerability management practices in OSS, provides valuable guidance to OSS owners, and highlights potential directions to improve the security of OSS platforms.},

Third, we consider the shared use of Natural Cycles, including partner involvement in temperature tracking, the sharing of intimate data, and navigating specific choices and risks regarding sex and contraception. We make a primarily empirical contribution to Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) research on shared uses of technology and the sharing of intimate data, and highlight avenues for future work to foster understanding of intimate technologies and their shared use in relational settings.},

Through a 16-month-long ethnographic study, including 24 interviews, we investigate the role of and tensions in data practices related to NXI’s daily maintenance and operations, cooperation, and sustainability. We find that NXI’s current data practices are functional and meaningful—sometimes requiring team workarounds—in the short term. However, various tensions and deficiencies in data practices hamper NXI’s sustainability. By contextualizing the temporal affordances of data, we propose design implications for data tools to align effectively with the practices of cooperatives and enhance organizational sustainability. Finally, we discuss how data designers and researchers, organizations or grassroots communities, and financial technology designers can benefit from our work, especially with regard to the maintenance and sustainability of small-scale organizations.},

To examine how and why knowledge workers switch between main, on-task, and off-task activities, we conducted a naturalistic study in real-world settings. Fifteen participants video-recorded a pre-scheduled one-hour work session and annotated their own data. Our findings show that participants deviated from the main task every 3.5 minutes on average, with self-initiated interruptions accounting for nearly 60% of off-task time. The attention span within the main working sphere has significantly decreased compared to prior decades to an average of 6 minutes of focused work. However, we found that multitasking does not inherently impede efficiency but depends on context. Additionally, personality traits such as conscientiousness, negative urgency, and agreeableness influence task engagement and distractions. We discuss implications for AI-driven attention management systems that adapt to both situational and individual factors to better support focus and workflow management.},

Artists continually navigate supportive and challenging interactions on social platforms, including community-shifting disruptions; the reuse of creative work for training generative AI is only the latest such disruption. Research into creativity support tools (CSTs) often centers artifact-making, leaving the HCI community with few strategies to understand the downstream impacts CSTs can make on artifact-sharing. Seeking a framework that captures this, we develop the creativity supportive ecosystem through interviews with 20 online artists, and 8 data “stewards” with experience reusing creative data for training GenAI. We use the CSE to describe how creative communities perceive and respond to disruption, identifying opportunities to empower artists in their collective negotiations with disruptive technologies like GenAI: by centering artists as producers of value, identifying creative and alternative data practices, and empowering inter-community flexibility.},

Existing approaches often fail to provide comprehensive and accurate presence awareness, as the necessary information is scattered across multiple applications and is frequently outdated, inaccurate or unavailable. To address this challenge, we introduce FlowTeams, a technology probe designed to (a) unify and combine presence information in one place, (b) cultivate the scheduling of workdays around focused work and collaboration, and (c) provide visibility of the information through both physical and digital presence awareness displays. In a field experiment, we deployed FlowTeams with 48 professionals across 10 hybrid working teams over an average of 6 weeks. The analysis of the collected data shows that the approach increased participants' awareness of their co-workers' availability, work hours and locations, and allowed them to better align their work schedules to their team's, while also structuring their workdays according to individual preferences. Furthermore, the results reveal that FlowTeams successfully mediated intrusive interruptions, enabling participants to significantly enhance their focus when necessary, while maintaining effective, yet less taxing, teamwork. Our work underscores the potential for supporting hybrid knowledge workers in negotiating a better balance between focused work and teamwork.},

abstract = {We formalize the notions of “permitted and obligatory announcements” in the context of information security, such as privacy policy compliance. In a sender-receiver setting, we define the sender’s permitted and obligatory announcements in terms of the receiver’s ideal epistemic states (i.e., the epistemic states that comply with the given security policies). We propose two logics, LPOA and DLPOA, to reason about permitted and obligatory announcements in static and dynamic contexts, respectively. These two logics are completely axiomatized, and we also study generalizations in which the receiver’s knowledge is characterized by non-S5 logics. Our paper makes two main contributions to the formalization of permitted and obligatory announcements: First, we clarify the interplay between the sender’s permitted and obligatory announcements and the receiver’s knowledge. Second, we distinguish between weakly and strongly permitted announcements.},

abstract = {Malware family labels and key features used for the decision-making of Android malware detection models fall short of precise comprehension of malicious behaviors due to their coarse granularity. To solve these problems, in this paper, we first introduce the concept of the malicious behavior trajectory (MBT) and propose an innovative approach called ProMal. ProMal aims to automatically generate malware descriptions with fine granularity through extracted MBTs from malware for users. Specifically, a labeled dataset of MBTs is constructed through substantial human efforts to build a behavioral knowledge graph (BxKG). The BxKG is scalable and can be automatically updated using two strategies to ensure its completeness and timeliness: 1) taking into consideration the evolution of Android SDKs, and 2) mining new MBTs by leveraging the widely-used malware datasets. We highlight that the knowledge graph is essential in ProMal, which can reason new MBTs based on existing MBTs because of its structured data representation and semantic relation modeling, and thus helps effectively extract real MBTs in Android malware. We evaluated ProMal on a recent malware dataset where researcher-crafted malware descriptions are available, and the Precision, Recall, and F1-Score of MBT identification based on BxKG reached 96.97%, 91.43%, and 0.94, respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches. Taking MBTs identified from Android malware as inputs, precise, fine-grained, and human-readable descriptions can be generated using the large language model, whose readability and usability are verified through a user study. The generated descriptions play a significant role in interpreting and comprehending malware behaviors.},

abstract = {Online dating is frequently used by individuals looking for potential relationships and intimate connections. Central to dating apps is the creation and refinement of a dating profile, which represents the way individuals desire to present themselves to potential mates, while hiding information they do not care to share. To investigate the way frequent users of dating apps construct their online profiles and perceive the effectiveness of strategies taken in making profiles, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 experienced users who are Chinese college-educated young adults and uncovered the processes and rationales by which they make profiles for online dating, particularly in selecting images for inclusion. We found that participants used idealized photos that exaggerated their positive personality traits, sometimes traits that they do not possess but perceive others to desire, and sometimes even traits they wish they had possessed. Users also strategically used photos that show personality and habits without showing themselves, and often hid certain identifying information to reduce privacy risks. This analysis signals potential factors that are key in building online dating profiles, providing design implications for systems that limit the use of inaccurate information while still promoting self-expression in relationship platforms.},

abstract = {Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) present significant challenges to cybersecurity. Using provenance graphs is one method to address APT attacks. However, traditional provenance graphs face issues such as dependency explosion and semantic gaps when handling these threats, which not only increase data processing complexity but also impact the accuracy of threat detection. To enhance both the efficiency and accuracy of threat detection, it is crucial to effectively compress provenance graphs to reduce data redundancy and complexity. However, existing provenance graph compression methods struggle to balance data reduction with detection capability. To address this issue, this paper introduces Argos, a detection–based provenance graph compression method. Argos creates contextually rich provenance graphs by fusing multi-source logs and designs compression rules tailored for detection, mitigating issues related to dependency explosion and semantic gaps. Experimental results demonstrate that Argos significantly outperforms traditional methods in both compression ratio and detection accuracy, particularly excelling in complex APT scenarios, while maintaining good time efficiency to meet real-time analysis needs.},

Through interviews and observations, we show how sellers use WhatsApp’s popularity to collaborate with women resellers and customers, enabling participation in online commerce bypassing e-commerce platforms. Using the lens of translation, we argue that WhatsApp functions as a tool and site of praxis for sellers who translate the complicated, standardized, and expensive processes of e-commerce platforms that are in English into multimodal, idiomatic, collaborative reselling practices. These are undertaken in regional languages on WhatsApp with the help of traders and women resellers economically benefiting everyone while delivering a personalized online shopping experience for customers. We discuss the politics of this translation, examining its impact on the design of e-commerce platforms while also shaping the discourse of reselling as an empowering pathway for women.},

Children with behavioral disabilities were particularly impacted, losing access to critical face-to-face behavioral health services. In response, many providers and parents attempted to recover these routine services, primarily with digital technology.In April-July 2020, we conducted a mixed-methods study with parents of children with behavioral disabilities. Using a six-week survey study followed by semi-structured interviews, we identified how disrupted behavioral health routines impacted children, and how care teams recovered these services using digital technology.The recovery of children's behavioral health services was delayed, resulting in negative consequences for the children. The stoppage of services undermined care teams' coordination mechanisms, necessitating they establish digital communication channels. This digital communication supported the recovery of some services, but not most. Video conferencing was overstimulating for some children, and most recovered services required parental involvement.Our findings have substantial implications for the CSCW community regarding the design of digital technology to increase usability by (and supports for) children with disabilities, and how behavioral health practice could enable resilient behavioral health services that could withstand the impact of future disruption.},

Over six months, interviews and focus groups were performed to explore their smartwatch use alongside T1D management. Thematic analysis highlighted that smartwatches have potential as a display, interface and data source in T1D management, which is of particular importance as artificial intelligence plays a growing role in self-management ecosystems. It also emphasised the need for customisation, flexibility and adaptability, and automation in the design of technology to promote integration into existing self-management ecosystems for both T1D and other chronic conditions.},

Addressing the imperative need for proper authorship attribution is essential to uphold the credibility and accountability of authentic authorship. The rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) have blurred the lines between human and machine authorship, posing significant challenges for traditional methods. We present a comprehensive literature review that examines the latest research on authorship attribution in the era of LLMs. This survey systematically explores the landscape of this field by categorizing four representative problems: (1) Human-written Text Attribution; (2) LLM-generated Text Detection; (3) LLM-generated Text Attribution; and (4) Human-LLM Co-authored Text Attribution. We also discuss the challenges related to ensuring the generalization and explainability of authorship attribution methods. Generalization requires the ability to generalize across various domains, while explainability emphasizes providing transparent and understandable insights into the decisions made by these models. By evaluating the strengths and limitations of existing methods and benchmarks, we identify key open problems and future research directions in this field. This literature review serves a roadmap for researchers and practitioners interested in understanding the state of the art in this rapidly evolving field.

abstract = {WebAssembly enables fast execution of performance-critical in web applications utilizing native code. However, recent research has demonstrated the potential for memory corruption errors within WebAssembly modules to exploit web applications. In this work, we present the first systematic analysis of memory corruption in WebAssembly, unveiling the prevalence of a novel threat model where memory corruption enables code injection on a victim’s browser. Our large-scale analysis across 37797 domains reveals that an alarming 29411 (77.81%) of those fully trust data coming from potentially attacker-controlled sources. As a result, an attacker can exploit memory errors to manipulate the WebAssembly memory, where the data is implicitly trusted and frequently passed into security-sensitive functions such as eval or directly into the DOM via innerHTML. Thus, an attacker can abuse this trust to gain JavaScript code execution, i.e., Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).   To tackle this issue, we present Wemby, the first viable approach to efficiently analyze WebAssembly-powered websites holistically. We demonstrate that Wemby is proficient at detecting remotely exposed memory corruption errors in web applications through fuzzing. For this purpose, we implement binary-only WebAssembly instrumentation that provides fine-grained memory corruption oracles. We applied Wemby to different websites, uncovering several memory corruption bugs, including one on the Zoom platform. In terms of performance, our ablation study demonstrates that Wemby outperforms current WebAssembly fuzzers. Specifically, Wemby achieves an average speed improvement of 232 times and delivers 46% greater code coverage compared to the state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) speech generation and voice cloning technologies have produced naturalistic speech and accurate voice replication, yet their influence on sociotechnical systems across diverse accents and linguistic traits is not fully understood. This study evaluates two synthetic AI voice services (Speechify and ElevenLabs) through a mixed methods approach using surveys and interviews to assess technical performance and uncover how users’ lived experiences influence their perceptions of accent variations in these speech technologies. Our findings reveal technical performance disparities across five regional, English-language accents and demonstrate how current speech generation technologies may inadvertently reinforce linguistic privilege and accent-based discrimination, potentially creating new forms of digital exclusion. Overall, our study highlights the need for inclusive design and regulation by providing actionable insights for developers, policymakers, and organizations to ensure equitable and socially responsible AI speech technologies.},

To address this challenge, we study general variations in users’ intended navigation experiences. Based on 30 interviews, we find that interactions with navigation apps can be subsumed under three “modes”: follow, modify, and background. For each mode of interaction, we highlight users’ key motivations, interactions with apps, and challenges. We propose these modes as higher-level concepts for exploring how to enable the details of navigation support to be adaptable to users’ generally intended navigation experiences. We discuss broader implications for issues of efficiency and overreliance in our experience of the physical environments through navigation apps.},

abstract = {We are used to the conventional model in which access control is provided by a trusted central entity or by a set of distributed entities that coordinate to mimic a central entity. Authorization decisions are based on a single, append-only total ordering of all actions, including policy updates, which leads to strong consistency guarantees. Recent systems based on conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) break with this conceptual model to gain fundamental advantages in latency, availability, resilience, and Byzantine fault tolerance. These systems replace up-front coordination with subsequent reconciliation of decentralized authorization decisions and policy updates. One of these is the Matrix group communication system, whose massive public sector deployments in Europe necessitate timely characterization of the underlying alternative conceptual model. Similarly to eventually consistent replication in CRDTs, we define 'eventually consistent access control' and present its consequences. Our model postulates thinking in two orderings of actions with different consequences for authorization: a partial ordering for storage, where the past of an action is final knowledge, and a total ordering for execution, where the past of an action is a mutable belief.},

We discuss calibrating appropriate levels of user trust in LLM-based administrative systems, mitigating newly introduced burdens. In particular, our findings suggest that evidence-based information disclosure is necessary in benefits administration and propose directions for future research on trust-burden dynamics in AI-assisted administration systems.},

Previous works have proposed modifications to Tor’s path selection algorithm to enhance both performance and security, but many proposals have unintended consequences due to incorporating information related to client location. We instead propose selecting paths using a global view of the network, independent of client location, and we propose doing so with a machine learning classifier to predict the performance of a given path before building a circuit. We show through a variety of simulated and live experimental settings, across different time periods, that this approach can significantly improve performance compared to Tor’s default path selection algorithm and two previously proposed approaches. In addition to evaluating the security of our approach with traditional metrics, we propose a novel anonymity metric that captures information leakage resulting from location-aware path selection, and we show that our path selection approach leaks no more information than the default path selection algorithm.},

abstract = {In today's evolving digital landscape, cybersecurity threats [1] have become increasingly complex and persistent, with attacks like data breaches and ransomware exploiting vulnerabilities in digital systems. As organizations handle growing amounts of data, robust defense strategies depend on comprehensive datasets for detecting and preventing threats. This paper addresses data scarcity in cybersecurity by proposing the development of a dataset ontology tailored to the domain. In data science, ontologies are structured frameworks that define relationships between different concepts within a specific field. A dataset ontology for cybersecurity serves as a cohesive framework for categorizing, organizing, and interconnecting datasets, making it easier for professionals to access and analyze threat-relevant data. The objective is to fill the gap in existing datasets and enable more precise, data-driven cybersecurity strategies. Every cyber-attack generates data, such as network logs, malware metadata, or phishing records. Professionals use this data to analyze threats, understand attack methods, and devise preventive strategies.AI models rely on large volumes of high-quality data to train algorithms, using historical patterns to detect real-time threats and respond before significant damage occurs. Unfortunately, the lack of structured and comprehensive datasets [2] in cybersecurity presents a significant challenge to building these AI models. The data generated by cyber-attacks is often fragmented, inconsistent, or incomplete, making it difficult to develop accurate threat detection systems. Without access to well-organized datasets, AI models are less effective, prone to producing false positives, and unable to adapt to new types of attacks [3]. As a result, cybersecurity defenses are weakened, leaving organizations vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated threats. The dataset ontology proposed in this paper seeks to address the challenge of data scarcity by providing a structured framework for organizing cybersecurity datasets. By categorizing and systematizing data related to various types of cyber-attacks, this ontology facilitates a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of the threat landscape. In the case of cybersecurity, the ontology organizes data based on categories such as attack types, threat actors, vulnerabilities, and attack methods.This proposed well-designed dataset ontology offers several key benefits. First, it makes it easier to identify gaps in existing datasets and create new, targeted datasets that capture the intricacies of real-world cyber-attacks. These datasets can then be used to train AI models, ensuring that they are better equipped to detect and respond to emerging threats. Second, this ontology establishes relationships between different types of cyber-attacks, providing a more holistic view of how these attacks are interconnected. For example, it can link phishing attacks to ransomware infections, allowing AI models to recognize patterns that may otherwise go unnoticed. The ontology-driven approach is particularly valuable because it enables continuous updates and improvements to cybersecurity datasets. As cyber threats evolve, so must the data used to train AI models. A dataset ontology provides the flexibility needed to incorporate new data as it becomes available, ensuring that cybersecurity models remain relevant and effective in the face of changing attack patterns.The research involved the creation of a preliminary draft taxonomy followed by the categorization and classification of the taxonomy into distinct clusters, representing different facets within the realm of cybersecurity. The dataset ontology introduced in this paper offers a solution by ensuring that AI models have access to well-organized, comprehensive datasets that reflect the full spectrum of cyber threats. By systematically categorizing different types of cyber-attacks and the data associated with them, the ontology provides AI models with the information they need to detect both common and emerging threats. This, in turn, enhances the accuracy and reliability of these models, enabling them to detect real-time cyber-attacks with greater precision and fewer false positives.Moreover, the ontology-driven approach ensures that AI models remain adaptable in the face of evolving threats [4]. Cyber-attacks are not static; they continuously evolve as malicious actors develop new techniques to bypass existing defenses. Without access to updated datasets, AI models may become outdated and ineffective. The dataset ontology addresses this issue by allowing for continuous updates to the data used in training, ensuring that AI models remain agile and responsive to new challenges. The practical applications of the proposed dataset ontology extend beyond the realm of theoretical research. By providing a structured and comprehensive framework for organizing cybersecurity data, the ontology enables organizations to develop more effective defense strategies and respond more quickly to emerging threats. For instance, organizations can use dataset ontology to create AI models capable of detecting insider threats, which are particularly difficult to identify due to the complexity of monitoring behavior [5] within trusted environments. These models can also be used to detect zero-day vulnerabilities, which are exploited by attackers before security teams have the chance to patch them.Additionally, dataset ontology facilitates collaboration across the cybersecurity industry by providing a common framework for sharing data. Currently, many organizations struggle to share cybersecurity data due to the lack of standardized formats and structures. The proposed ontology provides a solution to this issue by offering a standardized framework that can be adopted across the industry, making it easier for organizations to collaborate and share data in a meaningful way.In conclusion, the creation of dataset ontology represents a significant advancement in the field of cybersecurity. By addressing the problem of data scarcity and fragmentation [5], the ontology provides a structured framework for organizing and interconnecting diverse datasets, allowing for more effective data analysis and threat detection. This ontology-driven approach enhances the accuracy and adaptability of AI models, enabling them to detect and neutralize cyber threats in real time. Furthermore, the practical applications of dataset ontology extend beyond academic research, empowering organizations to protect their data, infrastructure, and services from a wide range of cyber-attacks.As cyber threats continue to evolve, the need for structured and comprehensive datasets will only grow. The dataset ontology provides a much-needed solution to this challenge, ensuring that AI models remain effective in detecting and responding to new and emerging threats. By improving the way cybersecurity data is organized and analyzed, ontology helps safeguard the interconnected digital ecosystem that underpins modern society.},

abstract = {Civic technologies have helped activists mobilize large groups of people to complete simple actions like sharing a post on social media or signing an online petition. While mobilizing large numbers of people to complete low effort actions is important, mobilizing does not develop peoples' capacities to organize, which requires moving people up an engagement ladder to interdependently work with others on increasingly complex and challenging collective actions. Research on civic organizing suggests that deliberating with others about what collective actions to plan and complete is key to developing people's capacities to organize. In this paper, we explore whether deliberation can help organizers support potential activists in moving up the organizing engagement ladder. DeliberationWorks, a computer-supported deliberation system presents potential activists with background information on collective actions and intrapersonal deliberation questions, facilitates group discussion with experienced organizers, and prompts activists to fill out action plans for completing actions. Findings across two field deployments suggest that DeliberationWorks effectively helped organizers support potential activists in increasing their knowledge and interest in taking collective action, as well as successfully planning actions. Yet our findings also present a complex picture of additional learning challenges organizers encounter in deepening potential activists' engagement with organizing beyond the deliberation. We present four distinct engagement journeys based on participants' experiences during and after the deliberation to inform the design of future socio-technical interventions for moving potential activists further up the ladder. Our findings suggest that future systems designed to develop people's capacities to organize should help organizers invest in potential activists' capacities to increase engagement in the organization through 1-1 coaching and follow-up communications, based on understanding of their interests and needs from the deliberation. We contribute a novel approach that leverages organizing theory to design deliberation features to support organizers in increasing people's engagement with organizing, as well as evidence collected across two case study deployments that contribute a deepened understanding of new potential activists' needs in getting started with organizing.},

In this study, we seek to better understand the experiences of creators who received a burst of attention, as identified by their participation in a trend highlighting an earlier video that had ''blown up.'' Through mixed-methods analysis of TikTok trace data and interviews, we show that massive surges in attention can have significant, varied, and long-lasting impacts on creators — within the platform and beyond. These include a short-term increase in views and sharing more similar content, and posting more content responding to other content on the platform. We also show how algorithmically-mediated bursts — or ''boosts'' — of attention led to shifts in creators' conceptualizations of themselves, the platform, and their audiences. Our work contributes empirical and conceptual insights into online fame and celebrity, how audiences and influencers interact, and how the affordances and cultures of TikTok shape how sudden attention is experienced on the platform.},

We made the platform available to 330 participants representative of the U.S. population in terms of age, sex, ethnicity, and political leaning, and compared their views with those of 100 AI influencers identified by Time magazine. The public fears AI getting out of control, while influencers emphasize regulation, seemingly to deflect attention from their alleged focus on monetizing AI’s potential. Interestingly, the views of AI influencers from underrepresented groups such as women and people of color often differ from the views of underrepresented groups in the public.},

abstract = {Over the past two decades, deep learning has received tremendous success in developing software systems across various domains. Deep learning frameworks have been proposed to facilitate the development of such software systems, among which, PyTorch and TensorFlow stand out as notable examples. Considerable attention focuses on exploring software engineering practices and addressing diverse technical aspects in developing and deploying deep learning frameworks and software systems. Despite these efforts, little is known about the open source software communities involved in the development of deep learning frameworks.In this article, we perform a comparative investigation into the open source software communities of the two representative deep learning frameworks, PyTorch and TensorFlow. To facilitate the investigation, we compile a dataset of 2,792 and 3,288 code commit authors, along with 9,826 and 19,750 participants engaged in issue events on GitHub, from the two communities, respectively. With the dataset, we first characterize the structures of the two communities by employing four operationalizations to classify contributors into various roles and inspect the contributions made by common contributors across the two communities. We then conduct a longitudinal analysis to characterize the evolution of the two communities across various releases, in terms of the numbers of contributors with various roles and role transitions among contributors. Finally, we explore the causal effects between community characteristics and the popularity of the two frameworks.We find that the TensorFlow community harbors a larger base of contributors, encompassing a higher proportion of core developers and a more extensive cohort of active users compared to the PyTorch community. In terms of the technical background of the developers, 64.4% and 56.1% developers in the PyTorch and TensorFlow communities are employed by the leading companies of the corresponding open source software projects, Meta and Google, respectively; 25.9% and 21.9% core developers in the PyTorch and TensorFlow communities possess Ph.D. degrees, while 77.2% and 77.7% contribute to other machine learning or deep learning open source projects, respectively. Developers contributing to both communities demonstrate spatial and temporal similarities to some extent in their pull requests across the respective projects. The evolution of contributors with various roles exhibits a consistent upward trend over time in the PyTorch community. Conversely, a noticeable turning point in the growth of contributors characterizes the evolution of the TensorFlow community. Both communities show a statistically significant decreasing trend in the inflow rates of core developers. Furthermore, we observe statistically significant causal effects between the expansion of communities and retention of core developers and the popularity of deep learning frameworks. Based on our findings, we discuss implications, provide recommendations for sustaining open source software communities of deep learning frameworks, and outline directions for future research.},

To support haptic design, we introduce HapticGen, a generative model designed to create vibrotactile signals from text inputs. We conducted a formative workshop to identify requirements for an AI-driven haptic model. Given the limited size of existing haptic datasets, we trained HapticGen on a large, labeled dataset of 335k audio samples using an automated audio-to-haptic conversion method. Expert haptic designers then used HapticGen’s integrated interface to prompt and rate signals, creating a haptic-specific preference dataset for fine-tuning. We evaluated the fine-tuned HapticGen with 32 users, qualitatively and quantitatively, in an A/B comparison against a baseline text-to-audio model with audio-to-haptic conversion. Results show significant improvements in five haptic experience (e.g., realism) and system usability factors (e.g., future use). Qualitative feedback indicates HapticGen streamlines the ideation process for designers and helps generate diverse, nuanced vibrations.},

One promising approach is Hybrid gifting, which combines digital and physical elements to improve the perceived value of gifts and provide opportunities for interpersonalisation. However, there is limited understanding of how hybridity shapes the dynamics of gifting in everyday contexts. To explore this, we developed a connected coffee machine prototype as a technology probe to study how givers personalise hybrid gifts and how recipients experience them. A study with seven pairs in intimate relationships revealed key insights: hybridity fosters slow, deliberate engagement; supports personalisation aligned with daily routines; grants recipients autonomy in receiving gifts; and reveals tensions between giver anxiety and recipient enjoyment. We discuss design implications for hybrid gifting systems that encourage recipients to savour digital gifts through slow, reflective interactions.},

Through our analysis we focus on how to transfer this learning into design considerations towards enacting caring touch from technologies. Despite the rapidly growing expectation for and design interest in touch from technologies intending to enhance care and well-being, the knowledge on how to design caring touch is still fragmented. How caring touch is enacted in inter-personal touch is under-explored and such expertise from healthcare practitioners has not been engaged from the perspective of HCI design research. We propose designers to consider caring as an experiential quality instead of a division between instrumental types of touch and caring types. We recommend when designing for a caring quality in technology-initiated touch that designers create a progression of touch with dynamic sensitivity and adapt the materiality of actuating devices to the plural dimensions of the body’s textures.},

Through a community-engaged research approach, we conducted a digital skills learning intervention in a U.S. public housing community, where residents frequently face socioeconomic challenges and limited access to digital resources. Public housing is a community seldom explored in CSCW and HCI research and provides a unique context to study the ongoing digital skills gap. Through the lens of situated learning theory, we study how sociocultural factors impact the efficacy of a community-based computer skills learning intervention. Specifically, we examine how the public housing community organized various resources---online learning materials, instructors, peer social support, and on-the-job learning opportunities---for digital skills development. Notably, the training leveraged instructor critical care and peer support to develop a learning community between residents and leaders of the community NGO that continued beyond the formalized training program. We contribute to CSCW and HCI work on collective and assets-based approaches to enhancing digital capacity. Our work provides implications for building collective grassroots digital skills learning infrastructure that could create new digitally-engaged employment opportunities.},

Through 17 interviews with experienced social VR streamers, we unpack social VR streamers’ innovative strategies to further blur the boundary between VR and non-VR spaces to engage their audiences and potential limitations of their strategies. We add new insights into how social VR streamers transcend traditional 2D streamer-audience engagement, which also extend our current understandings of cross-reality interactions. Grounded in these insights, we propose design implications to better support more complicated cross-reality dynamics in social VR streaming while mitigating potential tensions, in hopes of achieving more inclusive, engaging, and secure cross-reality environments in the future.},

Through semi-structured interviews with 23 Japanese VRChat users, we explored the characteristics of close relationships formed in social VR, the processes of relationship development, and the role of platform features in shaping these dynamics. Our findings reveal that social VR facilitates a form of selective self-presentation and co-presence through embodied avatars and rich environmental contexts, which can lead to rapid and intense friendship formation. Users reported developing close bonds without relying on real-life background information, instead focusing on perceived familiarity and compatibility within the virtual space, highlighted by the avatar’s appearance. Further, platform features such as “join” functions that allow users to teleport to friends’ locations, were assigned special meanings by users, contributing to developing friendships.},

abstract = {While creativity is often romanticized as a serendipitous ’aha’ moment of insight, in reality, it is an iterative process that often involves searching for information on the Web. In this paper, we investigate the role of web search throughout the creative process. We conducted a longitudinal study involving 15 professionals engaged in creative work, such as scientific research, startup product design, and policy development, observing them throughout their one to six-month-long projects. We developed Web ChronoLogger, a browser extension that logs Web Search and Project document activity over the course of the project in an intuitive, transparent, and privacy-preserving manner. Additionally, we collect qualitative insights from participants reflecting on their logs through weekly surveys and a post-study interview. We find quantitative patterns in how participants search the web and work with information in working documents throughout their creative projects. Web search was used even when generating ideas and defining goals, stages often assumed to involve just mental processes. Further, patterns in the content, structure, and edit history of how participants work with information found on the web can encode signals about the user’s context, such as patterns and gaps in their knowledge, project goals and progress, and work style. This study’s longitudinal perspective provides a foundation for building the future of web search tools in ways that support the entire creative workflow.},

abstract = {AI tools are often promoted as revolutionary for streamlining labor- and cost-intensive UX workflows. Although their actual adoption and usage are more complex and nuanced than often portrayed, instances, where AI may be unnecessary or even undesirable are frequently overlooked. Therefore, we aim to gain deeper insights into technology non-use—viewed not merely as a binary opposite to use but as a spectrum of practices. Through semi-structured interviews with 15 UX practitioners, we identified factors influencing non-use across individual, professional, organizational, and societal dimensions. We use a sociotechnical assemblage lens to explore how multiple layers of an individual’s context interact within professional settings, how diverse politics intersect within individuals or organizations, and how these interactions evolve over time. We propose implications for rethinking AI application design and evaluation, for considering policy frameworks and AI design together and deliberating about where AI should and should not be used.},

We analyse four configurations utilising state-of-the-art tools, including the Threat Report ATT&amp;CK Mapper (TRAM) and open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Llama2. Our findings reveal significant challenges, including class imbalance, overfitting, and domain-specific complexity, which impede accurate technique extraction. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel two-step pipeline: first, an LLM summarises the reports, and second, a retrained SciBERT model processes a rebalanced dataset augmented with LLM-generated data. This approach achieves an improvement in F1-scores compared to baseline models, with several attack techniques surpassing an F1-score of 0.90. Our contributions enhance the efficiency of web-based CTI systems and support collaborative cybersecurity operations in an interconnected digital landscape, paving the way for future research on integrating human-AI collaboration platforms.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) for health has the potential to significantly change and improve healthcare. However in most African countries, identifying culturally and contextually attuned approaches for deploying these solutions is not well understood. To bridge this gap, we conduct a qualitative study to investigate the best practices, fairness indicators, and potential biases to mitigate when deploying AI for health in African countries. Additionally, we explore opportunities where AI could make a positive impact in health. We use a mixed-methods approach combining in-depth interviews (IDIs) and surveys. We conduct 1.5-2 hour long IDIs with 50 experts in health, policy, and AI across 17 countries, and, through an inductive approach, we conduct a qualitative thematic analysis on expert IDI responses. We administer a blinded 30-minute survey with case studies to 672 general population participants across 5 countries in Africa (Ghana, South Africa, Rwanda, Kenya and Nigeria), and analyze responses on quantitative scales, statistically comparing responses by country, age, gender, and level of familiarity with AI. We thematically summarize open-ended responses from surveys. Our results find generally positive attitudes, high levels of trust, accompanied by moderate levels of concern among general population participants for AI usage for health in Africa. This contrasts with expert responses, where major themes revolved around trust/mistrust, ethical concerns, and systemic barriers to integration, among others. This work presents the first-of-its-kind qualitative research study of the potential of AI for health in Africa from an algorithmic fairness angle, with perspectives from both experts and the general population. We hope that this work guides policymakers and drives home the need for further research and the inclusion of general population perspectives in decision-making around AI usage.},

Answer engines - LLM-powered search tools that generate source-cited summaries rather than just returning relevant links - represent a particularly significant shift from traditional search engines. Through a qualitative study of 21 expert users comparing answer engines to traditional search, we identified 16 ethical and societal limitations in current answer engine implementations. We showcase how current LLM-based search engine still lack the neccessary features to be treated as a safe sociotechnical system for public consumption. Based on these findings, we propose a framework of 16 corresponding design recommendations to guide the development of more trustworthy answer engine systems. We showcase of this application is still nascent and how we need to be more sensitive to their social ramifications, to create a better and safer experience for individuals.},

abstract = {This extrapolation explores the evolution of Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) and envisions its future integration with artificial intelligence (AI). As we transition from traditional organizational systems to sophisticated digital ecosystems, the concept of a ’second brain’ has emerged, exemplified by tools like Evernote and Notion. However, the integration of AI promises to transform this concept into an active personal companion. This AI-driven system would access multiple data streams, creating a rich, interconnected knowledge base that offers personalized insights and decision support. The paper discusses the potential design of such an AI companion. Unlike current tools that excel at organizing information, this AI companion would actively engage with data from various aspects of a user’s life, creating a dynamic, personalized knowledge overview. While the potential benefits are significant, the paper also addresses critical considerations, including privacy concerns, ethical implications, skill requirements for effective use, and the need to balance human intuition with machine intelligence. The discussion emphasizes the importance of maintaining user autonomy and critical thinking skills while leveraging AI capabilities. As we enter "The Intelligence Age," this extrapolation provides a foundation for further research and discussion on the responsible development and implementation of AI companions as advanced cognitive tools, aiming to augment human intelligence rather than replace it.},

We conducted two studies: (1) a survey (n=455 knowledge workers) to understand perceptions towards disclosing various information types among colleagues, and (2) an interview study (n=12 knowledge workers) with five speculative design concepts to characterize attitudes and needs around CMSD. Study 1 indicated sharing about well-being was valuable, but that it was less familiar among remote workers compared to those in-person or hybrid. Study 1 informed the design concepts for Study 2, whose findings revealed that CMSD is a key part of workers’ socialization and should evolve alongside relationship stages. We discuss design opportunities for adaptive, intentional, and personal CMSD, along with policy implications for organizations.},

abstract = {Modern embedded systems are powered by increasingly powerful hardware and are increasingly reliant on Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies for advanced capabilities. Large Language Models (LLMs) are now being widely used to enable the next generation of human-computer interaction. While LLMs have shown impressive task orchestration capabilities, their computation complexity has limited them to run on the cloud – which introduces internet dependency and additional latency. While smaller LLMs (&lt; 5𝐵 parameters) can run on modern embedded systems such as smartwatches and phones, their performance in UI-interaction and task orchestration remains poor. In this paper we introduce LUCI:Lightweight UI Command Interface. LUCI follows a separation of tasks structure by using a combination of LLM agents and algorithmic procedures to accomplish sub-tasks while using a high-level level LLM-Agent with rule-based checks to orchestrate the pipeline. LUCI addresses the limitations of previous In-Context learning approaches by incorporating a novel semantic information extraction mechanism that compresses the frontend code into a structured intermediate Information-Action-Field (IAF) representation. These IAF representations are then used by an Action Selection LLM. This compression allows LUCI to have a much larger effective context window along with better grounding due to the context information in IAF. Pairing our multi-agent pipeline with our IAF representations allows LUCI to achieve similar task success rates as GPT-4Von the Mind2Web benchmark, while using 2.7B parameter text-only PHI-2 model.

abstract = {Unlike any previous generation, children’s lives are now highly datafied, tracked, and digitally monitored. They are increasingly vulnerable to data collection from seemingly innocuous toys and devices with cameras, sensors, voice recognition, and geolocation. Yet, children typically lack awareness or control over these data exchanges, as consent is usually given by adult caregivers (who may also lack data literacy). Despite regulatory improvements, interdisciplinary approaches remain crucial to empowering children to understand, value, and manage their personal data. How can the IDC community involve children in the design and use of their personal data? This workshop unites experts to explore current practices. 1},

abstract = {Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) treatment faces significant accessibility challenges, with only 30-40% of diagnosed individuals receiving care. This work presents a PTSD intervention delivered through a mobile application designed based on evidence-based treatment principles, particularly cognitive restructuring. Rather than implementing traditional resource-intensive PTSD treatments, the app employs brief, daily, game-like interactions to train users to develop more adaptive perspectives of themselves, others, and the world. The app's text-based interactions incorporate three key mechanisms: directional swiping gestures for thought categorization, paired statement tasks with immediate animated feedback, and emoji-based labeling to reduce cognitive load during. These interaction patterns were designed to maintain therapeutic fidelity while leveraging familiar mobile interface conventions. Analysis of multiple assessments on the validated PCL-5 measure showed 28.1% achieved clinically reliable improvement (≥18 point reduction). These findings suggest that engagement with brief mobile interactions, designed based on evidence based techniques, may effectively reduce PTSD symptoms through digital platforms.},

However, the extent to which LCA informs the design of computing devices remains unclear. To understand how this information is collected and applied, we interviewed 17 industry professionals with experience in LCA or electronics design, systematically coded the interviews, and investigated common themes. These themes highlight the challenge of LCA data collection and reveal distributed decision-making processes where responsibility for sustainable design choices—and their associated costs—is often ambiguous. Our analysis identifies opportunities for HCI technologies to support LCA computation and its integration into the design process to facilitate sustainability-oriented decision-making. While this work provides a nuanced discussion about sustainable design in the information and communication technologies (ICT) hardware industry, we hope our insights will also be valuable to other sectors.},

We find that these T2I models generally do not produce quality outputs of dishes specific to various regions. This is true even for the US, which is typically considered more well-resourced in training data—although the generation of US dishes does outperform that of the investigated African countries. The models demonstrate the propensity to produce inaccurate and culturally misrepresentative, flattening, and insensitive outputs. These representational biases have the potential to further reinforce stereotypes and disproportionately contribute to erasure based on region.

Extractive research is when researchers take ''data'' (i.e., stories, knowledge) and other resources (e.g., time, labor) from communities but provide little in return. Scholars have examined collaboration practices, but this work has yet to focus on data analysis. We (academic and community researchers) explore the benefits, challenges, and power dynamics involved in collaborative analysis. We reflected on our process to co-analyze workshop data from a community-led initiative through member-checking interviews and a duo ethnography. In this paper, we detail the co-analysis approach we used and examine how structural power can incentivize extractive research practices. We pose that co-analyzing data according to community-defined questions can mitigate harm and advance community partners' goals.},

However, such approaches often oversimplify culture and face challenges in cross-cultural relevance. This study addresses these issues by exploring how participatory design can be both culturally grounded and adaptable across subcultures within African communities. We conducted 13 distributed design workshops with 19 participants, including people with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), caregivers, and pharmacists, from diverse ethnic groups in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. These workshops informed the design of a mobile health prototype featuring interactive flows in Pidgin English, collaborative care tools, peer support groups, and a calorie prediction feature. The prototype was evaluated by 30 participants through think-aloud sessions and interviews. Findings highlight that while some features aligned with local cultural norms, others were less effective across sociocultural boundaries, even within the same city. We offer insights and methodological guidance for developing digital health tools that are locally relevant and regionally adaptable.},

However, they may still, whether intentionally or unintentionally (e.g., due to third-party libraries imported), mis-declare cookies that may be abused for tracking. In this work, we introduce COOVER (&lt;u&gt;coo&lt;/u&gt;kie &lt;u&gt;v&lt;/u&gt;alue examin&lt;u&gt;er&lt;/u&gt;) to assess the non-compliance between the website-declared purpose and the semantic-intended purpose of cookies (denoted as potential cookie purpose violation ). We advocate that the value of the cookie is a more reliable indicator of its semantic-intended purpose compared to other features such as expiration time. COOVER decomposes the cookie value into primitive segments representing minimal semantic units, and fine-tunes a GPT-3.5 model to automatically interpret their value-inferred semantics. Based on the interpretation, it classifies cookies into four GDPR-defined purposes. COOVER achieves an F1 score of 95%, significantly outperforming other methods. We employ COOVER to analyze Alexa Top 1k websites to understand the status quo of potential cookie purpose violation on the web. Remarkably, out of 15,339 cookies across these websites, only 3.1% quality as truly necessary cookies, while 44.1% of websites suffer from issues of potential purpose violation.},

Critical consciousness is important in dismantling oppressive systems, but can be difficult and uncomfortable to develop. This study investigates how Papers, Please works as a transformational game about border crossing to facilitate the development of players’ critical consciousness as well as how players’ lived experiences are reflected through their in-game decision-making. We conducted a mixed-methods two-week diary study and phenomenological interviews with 41 participants, many of whom being first-time players. We assess players’ experiences through the six qualitative stages of critical consciousness development, which we adopt as a method of assessing learning within critical pedagogies. Using this framework, we suggest that in-game conflicting and reactionary immigration policy changes spark value and moral disequilibrium, which, in turn, may trigger players’ reflection on the game’s unjust immigration system and lead to critical introspection, motivation, and praxis around border crossing and immigration in the United States.},

abstract = {Recently, the jailbreak attack, which generates adversarial prompts to bypass safety measures and mislead large language models (LLMs) to output harmful answers, has attracted extensive interest due to its potential to reveal the vulnerabilities of LLMs. However, ignoring the exploitation of the characteristics in intention understanding, existing studies could only generate prompts with weak attacking ability, failing to evade defenses (e.g., sensitive word detect) and causing malice(e.g., harmful outputs). Motivated by the mechanism in the psychology of human misjudgment, we propose a dual intention escape (DIE) jailbreak attack framework to generate more stealthy and toxic prompts to deceive LLMs to output harmful content. For stealthiness, inspired by the anchoring effect, we designed the Intention-anchored Malicious Concealment(IMC) module that hides the harmful intention behind a generated anchor intention by the recursive decomposition block and contrary intention nesting block. Since the anchor intention will be received first, the LLMs might pay less attention to the harmful intention and enter response status. For toxicity, we propose the Intention-reinforced Malicious Inducement (IMI) module based on the availability bias mechanism in a progressive malicious prompting approach. Due to the ongoing emergence of statements correlated to harmful intentions, the output content of LLMs will be closer to these more accessible intentions, i.e., more toxic. We conducted extensive experiments under black-box settings, supporting that DIE could achieve 100% ASR-R and 92.9% ASR-G against GPT3.5-turbo.},

abstract = {The rise of data-sharing platforms, driven by public demand for open data and legislative mandates, has raised several pertinent issues. These encompass uncertainties over data accuracy, provenance and lineage, privacy concerns, consent management, and the lack of equitable incentives for data providers. The advanced nature of blockchain makes it well suited to address these concerns. Yet, the limitations of blockchains, particularly their restricted performance, scalability, and high cost, make them less adept at managing the four “Vs” of big data—volume, variety, velocity, and veracity. As the body of work proposing blockchain-based data-sharing solutions grows, so does the confusion in selecting between these platforms, particularly in terms of sharing mechanisms, services, quality of services, and applications. In this article, we aim to fill this knowledge gap through an in-depth survey of blockchain-based data-sharing architectures and applications. We first identify the key challenges of existing data-sharing techniques and lay out the foundations of blockchains. Our focus then shifts to the intersection of blockchain and data sharing, wherein we aim to clarify the existing landscape and propose a reference architecture for blockchain-based data sharing. Subsequently, we explore various industrial applications of blockchain-based data sharing, spanning healthcare, smart grids, transportation, and decarbonization. For each application, we draw from real-world deployments to present key lessons learned in the implementation of blockchain-based data sharing. Lastly, we shed light on current research challenges and open avenues for further study in this space. This article aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers/practitioners looking to navigate the complex terrain of blockchain-based data-sharing solutions.},

abstract = {In November 2023, Google Play introduced new closed testing requirements for apps submitted by developers operating with personal accounts, or indie app developers. These requirements mandate that at least 20 testers must remain opted-in (use the app) for at least 14 consecutive days before the app can be published on the Play Store. According to Google, these new requirements aim to ensure the quality and security of submitted apps. However, for individual developers operating without organizational support, adhering to such requirements can pose logistical challenges and lead to production delays. To understand these challenges, in this paper, we qualitatively analyze app developers’ discussions of Google Play’s new closed testing requirements on Reddit. Additionally, we report insights from a survey of 14 indie app developers who recently passed the requirements or are actively seeking compliance. Our results show that Google Play’s closed testing requirements for indie apps are commonly perceived as discriminatory, imposing logistical and bureaucratic barriers on small-scale creators in their quest to compete in the mobile app market. Our analysis also uncovers the strategies the Android developer community has adapted to navigate such requirements. Based on our findings, we propose several guidelines to help indie app developers integrate the testing requirements into their workflow. We further suggest design strategies to mitigate the impact of such requirements on innovation, fairness, and competition in the mobile app market.},

These findings are supported by a theoretical explanation on a linear model and empirical evidence on deep neural networks. Across all datasets we tested, we find that inputs with the lowest zero gradient percentage, on average, exhibit 34.5% more susceptibility to adversarial attacks than randomly selected inputs. Additionally, we demonstrate that the zero gradient percentage, as a metric, transfers across different model architectures. Finally, we propose a novel black-box attack pipeline that enhances the efficiency of conventional query-based black-box attacks and show that input pre-filtering based on Zero Gradient Percentage can boost the attack success rates, particularly under low perturbation levels. On average, across all datasets we test, our approach outperforms the conventional shadow model-based and query-based black-box attack pipelines by 44.9% and 30.4%, respectively.},

However, the varying capabilities of crowdsourcing service providers introduce transaction risks and reduce transaction performance. This study adopts an empirical research approach, using data from service providers on the Epwk platform as a sample, and employs data mining techniques to construct a credit evaluation model for crowdsourcing service providers. It further analyzes the impact pathways of transaction guarantee mechanisms on store performance. The research reveals the mechanisms through which different transaction guarantee mechanisms affect store performance, providing a theoretical basis for platforms to optimize their transaction guarantee systems.},

In this paper, we critically examine the state of human participant surveys associated with these topics. Through both a reflexive analysis of a survey pilot spanning six countries and a systematic literature review of 44 papers featuring public surveys related to AI, we explore prominent perspectives and methodological nuances associated with surveys to date. We find that public surveys on AI topics are vulnerable to specific Western knowledge, values, and assumptions in their design, including in their positioning of ethical concepts and societal values, lack sufficient critical discourse surrounding deployment strategies, and demonstrate inconsistent forms of transparency in their reporting. Based on our findings, we distill provocations and heuristic questions for our community, to recognize the limitations of surveys for meeting the goals of engagement, and to cultivate shared principles to design, deploy, and interpret surveys cautiously and responsibly.},

abstract = {How does firm size affect the privacy protections offered to customers? On the one hand, it could be that larger firms use their size to amass more data. On the other hand, smaller firms may be less careful in their data protection practices, because they have a different perception of risk. Using data from the Google Play Store over a three-year period, we explore this empirical question in the U.S. children's app market. Our findings indicate that larger app developers consistently implement stronger privacy protections, requesting less sensitive data compared to smaller developers. These results hold across empirical approaches, including instrumental variables and the propensity-score matching approach. Additionally, our analysis shows that mergers between developers and sudden increases in size of the user-bases of the product are associated with reduced data collection. We show that newly created and updated apps produced by large developers collect less data compared to existing apps. Our findings indicate a trend toward standardized privacy practices across different national regulatory regimes. This research highlights the potential for growth-driven improvements in data privacy practices among app developers, regardless of their regulatory context.},

Homeowners can easily program smart devices using conditional IF-THEN rules, where triggers prompt corresponding actions. However, as smart homes incorporate more multifunctional devices, conflicting trigger-action rules can simultaneously control devices in inconsistent ways, causing unexpected and potentially unsafe interference situations. This article introduces Sigfrid, a novel interference detection approach using scene interaction graphs constructed through Large Language Models (LLMs). To enhance LLM reasoning, we propose a new prompt engineering methodology that integrates automated and manual editing techniques to formulate queries for deriving causal insights in the smart home domain. Interferences are identified through efficient exploration of the graph constructed from the extracted relations. We evaluate Sigfrid on real-world If-This-Then-That (IFTTT) and SmartThings rule sets, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art methods by more than 21% in F1-score.},

Despite their significant role in reducing digital disparities, the specific needs and challenges these instructors face remain underexplored. Through qualitative interviews with five smartphone instructors in Seoul, South Korea, we uncover nuanced challenges across different aspects of ICT education for older adults. Our findings highlight difficulties in content selection and class administration, including managing individual demands, creating instructional material, and addressing privacy concerns during demonstrations. The instructors were also affected by the internal and external risks of older adults using technology. Based on these findings, we propose systematic support strategies such as resource hubs, privacy-preserving demonstration methods, adaptable learning modules, and deployable practice sessions. This study provides critical insights into these instructional challenges and proposes design considerations for developing assistive tools to support ICT education for older adults.},

abstract = {Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) present an evolving challenge in cybersecurity through increasingly sophisticated behavior. Cybersecurity Operations Centers (CSOCs) rely on standard playbooks to respond to myriad cyber threats; however, such methods quickly become outdated, leaving sensitive data at significant risk for theft and exploitation. To provide CSOCs with an advantage, playbooks capable of adapting to threats and environments must be developed for use with modern security orchestration and automation tools. Our methodology proposed herein trains autonomous cyber defense agents through offline reinforcement learning (RL) to address this need. Using the scalable, tailorable Cyber Virtual Assured Network, we simulate an APT conducting data exfiltration to then train an agent using offline RL and compare performance against a myopic policy. Initially, we see improvements in preventing exfiltration while ensuring authorized user access, but it is clear the agent must periodically retrain to account for changing adversarial behaviors.},

abstract = {Phone automation agents aim to autonomously perform a given natural-language user request, such as scheduling appointments or booking a hotel. While much research effort has been devoted to screen understanding and action planning, complex tasks often necessitate user interaction for successful completion. Aligning the agent with the user's expectations is crucial for building trust and enabling personalized experiences. This requires the agent to proactively engage the user when necessary, avoiding actions that violate their preferences while refraining from unnecessary questions where a default action is expected. We argue that such subtle agent-initiated interaction with the user deserves focused research attention.To promote such research, this paper introduces a task formulation for detecting the need for user interaction and generating appropriate messages. We thoroughly define the task, including aspects like interaction timing and the scope of the agent's autonomy. Using this definition, we derived annotation guidelines and created a diverse dataset for the task, leveraging an existing UI automation dataset. We tested several text-based and multimodal baseline models for the task, finding that it is very challenging for current LLMs. We suggest that our task formulation, dataset, baseline models and analysis will be valuable for future UI automation research, specifically in addressing this crucial yet often overlooked aspect of agent-initiated interaction. This work provides a needed foundation to allow personalized agents to properly engage the user when needed, within the context of phone UI automation.},

To address these limitations, we present PhishIntel, an end-to-end phishing detection system for real-world deployment. PhishIntel intelligently determines whether a URL can be processed immediately or not, segmenting the detection process into two distinct tasks: a fast task that checks against local blacklists and result cache, and a slow task that conducts online blacklist verification, URL crawling, and webpage analysis using an RBPD. This fast-slow task system architecture ensures low response latency while retaining the robust detection capabilities of RBPDs for zero-day phishing threats. Furthermore, we develop two downstream applications based on PhishIntel: a phishing intelligence platform and a phishing email detection plugin for Microsoft Outlook, demonstrating its practical efficacy and utility.},

Across five 2-hour focus group sessions, a group of 6 multilingual students and teachers affirmed many of the platform’s design choices, but reinforced that design at the margins was unfinished, including support for limited internet access, decade-old devices, and high turnover of device use by students with different access, language, and attentional needs. The group also highlighted open source platforms like GitHub as unsuitable for engaging youth. These findings suggest that EPLs that are both accessible and language-inclusive are feasible, but that there remain many design tensions between language design, learnability, accessibility, culture, and governance.},

This has a significant effect on the reliability of the results from applying a timeline analysis as part of an investigation. We investigate the problem of users tampering with timestamps on a running (“live”) system. While prior work has shown that digital evidence tampering is hard, we focus on the question of why this is so. By performing a qualitative user study with advanced university students, we derive factors that influence the reliability of successful tampering, such as the individual knowledge about temporal traces, and technical restrictions to change them. These insights help to assess the reliability of timestamps from individual artifacts that are used for event reconstruction and subsequently reduce the risk of misinterpretations.},

We present our experience deploying an in-course networking tool that enabled 1,600+ learners and teachers in a massive online CS1 course to form 2,000+ connections with other individuals. We discuss how social preferences and networking goals vary by demographics, economic factors, course goals, and course role. Contrary to usual online social behavior, users in our network sent more out-group requests than a random baseline by role (2.04x), gender (1.1x), and developing vs. developed country (1.07x). We highlight differences between developing vs. developed country users: developing country users send 2.5x requests and make, on average, 1.78x as many connections as those from developed countries. From a randomized control trial we find that random recommendations increase the volume of sent requests by 44.48% and promote cross-group requests across developing vs. developed countries (+28.9%), age (+15.1%), and gender (+8.6%). Ultimately we show that integrating socialization as a core feature of online CS1 classrooms can help support people from all backgrounds in achieving their diverse educational goals, which often extend well beyond improving coding proficiency.},

However, some of these tools allow researchers or instructors to access the pseudonym mapping. Others do not sufficiently consider the students' device usage, which may introduce bias when multiple devices are used, or when devices are reset or replaced. We propose a novel technique that addresses these limitations by generating pseudonyms using login credentials to university accounts. In addition, we provide results on a survey about device usage in introductory programming courses. These suggest that the vast majority of our students use more than one device and that the majority reset or replace their device at least once.

abstract = {The Tor network, while offering anonymity through traffic routing across volunteer-operated nodes, remains vulnerable to attacks that aim to deanonymize users by correlating traffic patterns between colluded entry and exit nodes in circuits. This paper presents a novel approach for detecting anomalous circuits in the Tor network, and for the first time provides a more comprehensive identification of potential malicious accomplice nodes in Tor by taking roles of nodes in anomalous circuits into consideration. Our method strategically utilizes modified middle nodes to capture traffic data, followed by a novel circuit classification based on traffic patterns to pinpoint concerned circuits. Two kinds of anomalies are identified: routing anomalies and usage anomalies, that respectively represent the anomalies with explicit or implicit violation of Tor's circuit construction guidelines. This leads to a successful revealing of totally 1,960 anomalous nodes in Tor. Furthermore, we apply clustering analysis with considering corresponding anomalous circuits and other key characteristics to the detected anomalous nodes, revealing potential hidden organizations behind these nodes that can threaten the network's security. Our findings highlight the necessity for the Tor project to adopt targeted mitigation strategies to enhance overall network security and privacy.},

abstract = {Smart consumer products, from voice assistants to fitness trackers, increasingly pervade daily life, generating and capturing information about us and our surroundings. This raises concerns about data misuse and its implications for privacy, autonomy, and other rights. Our study aims to uncover data collection, access, and usage practices to understand current challenges in data handling and data rights within smart product ecosystems. To investigate this, we analysed network traffic from 43 smart consumer products across 11 categories, revealing an extensive and global network of potential data transmission destinations. These findings underscore the importance of transparency in this context, including the need for clear justifications and explanations of organisational data handling practices.To complement the technical analysis, we then exercised legal (GDPR) transparency-related rights to request data handling details from vendors, aiming to better understand smart product data practices and contextualise our observations through traffic monitoring. We found that vendor responses were often insufficient and identified significant barriers to obtaining meaningful (and legally required) information.By empirically exposing the nature of data transmissions and the failure of vendors to meet transparency obligations, this paper reveals a troubling status quo: smart product users have minimal agency over their data, while vendors operate with little to no accountability. To address these issues, we propose recommendations to improve rights implementation, strengthen both regulatory and non-regulatory oversight, and foster collective action to empower individuals and groups in exercising their data rights.},

Results suggest that the title, description, and labels are the most important information when developers choose the issue to work on and pull requests to review. The quality of the description and reproduction steps also influenced how the developer ranked an issue. The contribution heat map and repository language were relevant areas that attracted more attention when they looked at user profiles.},

These promised improvements also extend to the control plane operations of 5G-SA, such as attachment/registration procedures to mobile networks, mobility, and security management to provide better user quality-of-experience (QoE). Most of the existing work explores the data plane and end-to-end performance of 5G. In this paper, we investigate and quantify the performance differences in the control plane of 5G-SA compared to 5G-NSA. Our results indicate that 5G-SA mostly has a worse (i.e., slower) control performance (by 16.6% for attachment/registration, PDU session establishment and 64.3% RRC procedure), unlike expectations, raising questions about current (virtualized) 5G-SA deployment and core network functionality placement.},

abstract = {Academic advising plays a crucial role in fostering student success. However, challenges such as limited advisor availability can hinder effective support. Generative AI, particularly AI-powered chatbots, offers the potential to enhance student advising in higher education by providing personalized guidance. These technologies help college students find the information and resources needed to create degree plans aligned with their academic goals. This research introduces ARGObot, an intelligent advising system that facilitates student navigation of university policies through automated interpretation of the student handbook as its primary knowledge base. ARGObot enhances accessibility to critical academic policies and procedures, supporting incoming students' success through personalized guidance. Our system integrates a multifunctional agent enhanced by a Large Language Model (LLM). The architecture employs multiple external tools to enhance its capabilities: a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system accesses verified university sources; email integration facilitates Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) interaction; and a web search function expands the system's knowledge base beyond predefined constraints. This approach enables the system to provide contextually relevant and verified responses to various student queries. This architecture evolved from our initial implementation based on Gemini 1 Pro, which revealed significant limitations due to its lack of agent-based functionality, resulting in hallucination issues and irrelevant responses. Subsequent evaluation demonstrated that our enhanced version, integrating GPT-4 with the text-embedding-ada-002 model, achieved superior performance across all metrics. This paper also presents a comparative analysis of both implementations, highlighting the architectural improvements and their impact on system performance.},

While previous studies have explored loneliness detection using smartphones and wearables, they often rely on phone calls, SMS, and app usage, which may not fully capture loneliness's complexity. Others focus on limited physiological signals, but both approaches raise privacy concerns. In this paper, we introduce LonelyTracker, a privacy-aware device designed to detect loneliness through continuous monitoring of physiological signals and daily activity patterns. Our system integrates wearable data, such as heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA), and mobility data from IMU sensors, to develop a comprehensive loneliness detection model. We use a deep neural network (DNN) with a split computing framework to ensure data privacy, processing sensor data locally and sending anonymized feature representations to the cloud for model training. Our 10-week study with 20 participants shows that combining multimodal data improves accuracy, achieving results between 81.1% and 96.5%. Furthermore, LonelyTracker outperforms smartphone-based solutions in energy efficiency and real-time performance, demonstrating its potential for improved mental health monitoring.},

We then propose Volume Leakage-Resilient EDESE (VLR-EDESE), a new scheme to protect against both query and document volume leakage. Our experimental results demonstrate that at k = 5000 (maximum security setting), VLR-EDESE incurs an overhead of 63\texttimes{} compared to the baseline EDESE without leakage protection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with 320\texttimes{} and 97\texttimes{} overhead, respectively. For smaller k values (10, 20, 50, 100), storage and communication overhead remain within 2\texttimes{} and 2.5\texttimes{} of the baseline EDESE, highlighting VLR-EDESE's flexibility. Finally, we present CloudSec, an implementation of VLR-EDESE that seamlessly integrates with cloud storage platforms, using OneDrive as an example.},

First, the dataset is preprocessed at the packet level and converted into grayscale images. Then, during the training process, data is distributed, extraction, and aggregated to enable joint training data provision from multiple parties while protecting user privacy. In this process, the improved ResNeXt network effectively improves the model's ability to capture complex encrypted traffic features through its optimized block structure and parallel stacking of the same topology design while retaining more fine-grained information and enhancing classification accuracy. Experimental results show that this method achieves better classification accuracy than advanced encrypted traffic classification models and ensures data security.},

abstract = {This paper presents WarmConnect, an innovative wearable technology designed to enhance social interaction through thermal feedback. The Bluetooth-enabled band generates warmth when users with compatible devices are nearby, with intensity increasing as they approach each other. This non-verbal, tactile signal provides a playful way to encourage engagement, particularly for individuals who may feel shy or anxious about starting conversations. WarmConnect aims to lower barriers to social connection in university environments by offering a low-pressure, embodied communication method. To assess its feasibility, a preliminary survey was conducted with eleven participants before developing a working prototype. This initial study yielded valuable insights into users’ perceptions and their willingness to use thermal technology for social connection. The findings indicate potential for WarmConnect to facilitate social interaction in university settings. The project explores the benefits of thermal technology in promoting inclusive, non-intrusive social behaviors while considering its limitations and future applications in various contexts.},

abstract = {Internet traffic classification has gained significance with the rapid growth of Internet networks and online applications. In this paper, we propose the IPSO-AlexNet-LSTM model, which effectively distinguishes encrypted network traffic. By combining the payload features and time-flow features of packets into feature vectors, AlexNet is used to extract the static features of IPSec VPN packets, and then the effectiveness of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks is utilized to capture the temporal dependencies of the packets. To further optimize model performance, an improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) heuristic algorithm is employed to fine-tune the hyperparameters of LSTM, ensuring enhanced robustness and generalization when handling the random and dynamic behaviors of malicious attacks. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully identifies IPSec VPN application traffic types and achieves a balanced trade-off between classification accuracy and speed, enabling efficient recognition of IPSec VPN encrypted traffic.},

abstract = {AI technologies in healthcare hold great promise for addressing numerous challenges, but ensuring that patients understand, trust, and adopt these technologies remains a significant hurdle. While the HCI community has proposed AI documentation frameworks (e.g., model cards) to enhance understanding, patient perspectives in the healthcare AI documentation remain underexplored. To address this gap, we designed prototypes based on existing frameworks and gathered feedback from 18 participants to explore their perspectives on AI documentation in cardiology, a domain where high-stakes AI tools are increasingly used and understanding users’ trust in AI is essential. Our findings revealed patient needs for more detailed information about healthcare AI technologies, the importance of extrinsic trust cues (e.g., regulatory status), and the integration of AI documentation into existing care processes. Based on these findings, we discuss two design implications: enhancing patient-centeredness in AI documentation and leveraging extrinsic trust cues to improve its design. This study contributes to the HCI community by amplifying the patient voice in designing AI documentation and offering actionable insights into leveraging extrinsic trust cues effectively.},

This study explores how ML practitioners with limited experience in bias understand and apply bias definitions, detection measures, and mitigation methods. Through a take-home task, exercises, and interviews with 22 participants, we identified five key themes: sources of bias, selecting bias metrics, detecting bias, mitigating bias, and ethical considerations. Participants faced unresolved conflicts, such as applying fairness definitions in practice, selecting context-dependent bias metrics, addressing real-world biases, balancing model performance with bias mitigation, and relying on personal perspectives over data-driven metrics. While bias mitigation techniques helped identify biases in two datasets, participants could not fully eliminate bias, citing the oversimplification of complex processes into models with limited variables. We propose designing bias detection tools that encourage practitioners to focus on the underlying assumptions and integrating bias concepts into ML practices, such as using a harmonic mean-based approach, akin to the F1 score, to balance bias and accuracy.},

abstract = {General purpose AI, such as ChatGPT, seems to have lowered the barriers for the public to use AI and harness its power. However, the governance and development of AI still remain in the hands of a few, and the pace of development is accelerating without a comprehensive assessment of risks. As a first step towards democratic risk assessment and design of general purpose AI, we introduce Particip-AI, a carefully designed framework for laypeople to speculate and assess AI use cases and their impacts. Our framework allows us to study more nuanced and detailed public opinions on AI through collecting use cases, surfacing diverse harms through risk assessment under alternate scenarios (i.e., developing and not developing a use case), and illuminating tensions over AI development through making a concluding choice on its development. To showcase the promise of our framework towards informing democratic AI development, we run a medium-scale study with inputs from 295 demographically diverse participants. Our analyses show that participants' responses emphasize applications for personal life and society, contrasting with most current AI development's business focus. We also surface diverse set of envisioned harms such as distrust in AI and institutions, complementary to those defined by experts. Furthermore, we found that perceived impact of not developing use cases significantly predicted participants' judgements of whether AI use cases should be developed, and highlighted lay users' concerns of techno-solutionism. We conclude with a discussion on how frameworks like Particip-AI can further guide democratic AI development and governance.},

abstract = {The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) creates new opportunities for recommender systems, especially by exploiting the side information (e.g., descriptions and analyses of items) generated by these models. However, aligning this side information with collaborative information from historical interactions poses significant challenges. The inherent biases within LLMs can skew recommendations, resulting in distorted and potentially unfair user experiences. On the other hand, propensity bias causes side information to be aligned in such a way that it often tends to represent all inputs in a low-dimensional subspace, leading to a phenomenon known as dimensional collapse, which severely restricts the recommender system’s ability to capture user preferences and behaviours. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework named Counterfactual LLM Recommendation (CLLMR). Specifically, we propose a spectrum-based side information encoder that implicitly embeds structural information from historical interactions into the side information representation, thereby circumventing the risk of dimension collapse. Furthermore, our CLLMR approach explores the causal relationships inherent in LLM-based recommender systems. By leveraging counterfactual inference, we counteract the biases introduced by LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CLLMR approach consistently enhances the performance of various recommender models.},

Equipment systems and data assets are important resources for enterprises. Asset monitoring and vulnerability identification serve as pivotal technical methods for clarifying enterprise assets, identifying potential threats, and mitigating security risks. These methods facilitate the timely detection of high-risk vulnerable assets, thereby reducing the likelihood of risk events. This article explores research on network asset monitoring and vulnerability identification technology for industrial enterprises, proposes methods for asset information identification, vulnerability determination, and a hazard level assessment model. This aims to enhance the visibility and controllability of enterprise security situations, thereby contributing to the improvement of network security protection in the industrial field and supporting the advancement of new industrialization.},

Such platforms extend people’s limited powers of attention by extrapolating their preferences to large collections of previously unconsidered informational objects. However, platforms typically also allow users to influence the attention of other users in various ways. We introduce a formal framework for measuring how much a given platform empowers each user to both pull information into their own attention and push information into the attention of others. We also use these definitions to clarify the implications of generative foundation models and other recent advances in AI for the structure and efficiency of digital platforms. We conclude with a set of possible strategies for better understanding and reshaping attentional agency online.},

abstract = {Computer science research sometimes brushes with the law, from red-team exercises that probe the boundaries of authentication mechanisms, to AI research processing copyrighted material, to platform research measuring the behavior of algorithms and users. U.S.-based computer security research is no stranger to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in a relationship that is still evolving through case law, research practices, changing policies, and legislation.Amid the landscape computer scientists, lawyers, and policymakers have learned to navigate, anti-fraud laws are a surprisingly under-examined challenge for computer science research. Fraud brings separate issues that are not addressed by the methods for navigating CFAA, DMCA, and Terms of Service that are more familiar in the computer security literature. Although anti-fraud laws have been discussed to a limited extent in older research on phishing attacks, modern computer science researchers are left with little guidance when it comes to navigating issues of deception outside the context of pure laboratory research.In this paper, we analyze and taxonomize the anti-fraud and deception issues that arise in several areas of computer science research. We find that, despite the lack of attention to these issues in the legal and computer science literature, issues of misrepresented identity or false information that could implicate anti-fraud laws are actually relevant to many methodologies used in computer science research, including penetration testing, web scraping, user studies, sock puppets, social engineering, auditing AI or socio-technical systems, and attacks on artificial intelligence. We especially highlight the importance of anti-fraud laws in two particular research fields that are of great policy importance in the current moment: attacking or auditing AI systems, and research involving legal identification.Finally, guided by principles in research ethics, we suggest methods for computer scientists to navigate fraud and identity issues, as well as possible legal paths forward for policymakers to consider.},

Integrated into existing courses, this engine can enhance labs with detailed, structured feedback, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. A preliminary study with 11 students showed that all participants could complete complex tasks using the feedback provided by the engine, with limited instruction from the authors. Additionally, about 90% of the students reported high satisfaction with the structured feedback. This approach has the potential to transform cybersecurity education, making it more interactive, practical, and aligned with real-world requirements.},

abstract = {Caching content at the edge network is a popular and effective technique widely deployed to alleviate the burden of network backhaul, shorten service delay, and improve service quality. However, there has been some controversy over privacy violations in caching content at the edge network. On the one hand, the multi-access open edge network provides an ideal entrance or interface for external attackers to obtain private data from edge caches by extracting sensitive information. On the other hand, privacy can be infringed on by curious edge caching providers through caching trace analysis targeting the achievement of better caching performance or higher profits. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of privacy issues in edge caching networks is vital and indispensable for creating a privacy-preserving caching service at the edge network. In this article, we are among the first to fill this gap by examining privacy-preserving techniques for caching content at the edge network. First, we provide an introduction to the background of privacy-preserving edge caching. Next, we summarize the key privacy issues and present a taxonomy for caching at the edge network from the perspective of private information. Additionally, we conduct a retrospective review of the state-of-the-art countermeasures against privacy leakage from content caching at the edge network. Finally, we conclude the survey and envision challenges for future research.},

abstract = {The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) presents a paradigm shift in knowledge work. To examine its impact on productivity, we conducted seven focus groups (n=37) with employees across diverse job functions in an enterprise setting, where workers engaged with a large language model (LLM) embedded in a suite of productivity applications. Our study identified four categories of GenAI-facilitated work activities: information management, content generation, problem solving, and communication and collaboration. These findings offer a grounded framework of GenAI-enabled practices for both researchers and practitioners, while also surfacing key challenges in realizing GenAI’s promised productivity gains. Beyond conventional metrics like time savings or output volume, participants attributed productivity improvements to time redistribution, enhanced decision-making, and reduced reliance on traditional intermediaries. We contribute actionable insights for designing GenAI systems that support context-aware productivity in the evolving landscape of knowledge work.},

abstract = {DATA SINS explores the concept of data colonialism as an emerging phenomenon in the early 21st century, fostering a critical understanding of its implications for human autonomy. Through speculative design, the project investigates how utopian ideals in data-driven technologies obscure neocolonial practices of data production and appropriation. Grounded in a theoretical framework, the storytelling mimics historical colonialism by exposing how the intertwined political, economic, and religious powers shape data-driven rituals and artifacts. This inquiry gains particular relevance in the context of Brazil's political conservatism over the past decade, which has consolidated a union between religious moralism, authoritarianism, and economic liberalism. The research underscores the non-neutrality of data, highlighting its role in shaping creative socio-technological design practices that safeguard not only the integrity of the self but the future of democracy itself.},

abstract = {This paper presents and advocates for an initiative to expand access to secure programming education. The Strengthening Workforce Education: Excellence in Programming Securely (SWEEPS) initiative, funded by the National Centers of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity (NCAE-C) program, seeks to advance secure programming and help achieve security aims. SWEEPS establishes a secure programming curriculum and workforce development coalition of seven institutions across two CAE (Center of Academic Excellence) regions (Northeast and Southwest) and five states (California, Massachusetts, Maryland, Indiana, and North Carolina). This coalition includes industry-based stakeholders collaborating with the US Army and government agencies on various projects. SWEEPS draws on prior work establishing critical concepts in secure programming, assessment tools, learning aids, and system infrastructure. The initiative offers a series of interconnected, stackable learning experiences tailored for early to mid-career professionals looking to enhance their cybersecurity skills. These experiences, which include practical one-day workshops and comprehensive year-long graduate certificates, provide a reassuring path for upskilling in secure programming. This paper recommends the efficacy of stackable training approaches in secure programming by exploring the practices of targeting and training individuals with diverse proficiency levels of programming experience who would benefit from increased knowledge and training.},

Rooted in feminist post-human approaches and post-humanist HCI, these probes aim to bridge nature and culture, offering diverse perspectives on heritage. Developed through an iterative research-through-design approach, the tools include postcards and sensory maps, enabling visitors to document their reflections and sensory experiences. Field tests at two UNESCO heritage sites highlight the probes' potential to capture diverse, contextual data and foster deeper connections with nature and cultural heritage. However, tensions emerged between heritage preservation, public engagement, and technology's role in nature. The study underscores the importance of inclusive, co-designed tools to balance economic, cultural, and environmental entanglements. The findings advocate for adaptive, seasonally varied deployments to better address the diverse needs of heritage visitors and stakeholders, ultimately contributing to more empathetic and sustainable heritage site management and visitor experience design.},

abstract = {The combination of Bengali literature and AI revolutionized the chatbot industry and opened the door for other languages ready to be digitally represented. The fusion of Bengali culture and AI technology stands us out in the competitive world of chatbots. As part of our research, we built a machine-learning-powered chatbot, which we trained using PyTorch Neural Networks to combine cultural heritage with sophisticated technology. The way AI advances fascinates us as it lets us process languages such as Bengali. The extensive use of chatbots revolutionizes the use of the Bengali language and pushes Bengali language processing to new heights. Given its groundbreaking nature, the study presents a new standard for the digital representation of the Bengali language and other languages. We utilized a predesigned dataset to train the chatbot, including 30 distinct scenarios. This hands-on approach ensured that the diversity of Bengali use was captured, thus allowing the chatbot to reply and understand multiple contexts. Using a large dataset has enabled us to train a chatbot with a response accuracy of 99%. We believe that this is a testament to the reliability and performance of the chatbot when it comes to using and communicating in the Bengali language, which can easily be adapted for other languages, too. The themes this study covers have substantially assisted in advancing a high-performing Bengali model for natural language processing.},

abstract = {Academic cheating poses a significant challenge to conducting fair online assessments. One common way is collusion, where students unethically share answers during the assessment. While several researchers proposed solutions, there is lack of clarity regarding the specific types they target among the different types of collusion. Researchers have used statistical techniques to analyze basic attributes collected by the platforms, for collusion detection. Only few works have used machine learning, considering two or three attributes only; the use of limited features leading to reduced accuracy and increased risk of false accusations.In this work, we focus on In-Parallel Collusion, where students simultaneously work together on an assessment. For data collection, a quiz tool is improvised to capture clickstream data at a finer level of granularity. We use feature engineering to derive seven features and create a machine learning model for collusion detection. The results show: 1) Random Forest exhibits the best accuracy (98.8%), and 2) In contrast to less features as used in earlier works, the full feature set provides the best result; showing that considering multiple facets of similarity enhance the model accuracy. The findings provide platform designers and teachers with insights into optimizing quiz platforms and creating cheat-proof assessments.},

abstract = {The persistent under-representation of students from groups historically underrepresented in Computer Science and Engineering (CS&amp;E) programs presents a significant challenge to achieving diversity within the field. A workforce with diverse experiences and perspectives is essential for creating innovations that serve all members of society. Existing documented efforts to broaden diversity in CS&amp;E are time-intensive (multi-week programs) and do not quantify attraction to graduate studies.This paper aims to bridge that gap by presenting and evaluating a detailed design for a one-day workshop that includes presentations from research professors, hands-on cybersecurity demos, a panel discussion with current and recent graduate students in CS&amp;E, and a participation survey. By engaging students historically underrepresented in CS&amp;E in the topic of graduate school, we aim to increase the diversity of students who apply to and attend graduate school, and ultimately enter the workforce through industry or through the professoriate, thus making the field more diverse and representative of varied perspectives.We held the aforementioned workshop at a Hispanic-Serving Institution in April 2024. The event successfully attracted members of historically under-represented groups. Our survey results show that 78% of the participants agreed or strongly agreed that the event increased their interest in graduate school, 72% were more likely to seek further information about attending graduate school, and 67% of the participants had an increased interest in CS&amp;E research. Our experience shows that one-day events focused on engaging students in the topic of graduate school in CS&amp;E can positively impact attendee's interest in graduate school and provide valuable information about the application process and graduate school experience.},

While prior research on approximated unlearning has demonstrated accuracy and efficiency in time complexity, we claim that it falls short of achieving exact unlearning, and we are the first to focus on fairness and robustness in machine unlearning algorithms. Our study presents fairness Conjectures for a well-trained model, based on the variance-bias trade-off characteristic, and considers their relevance to robustness. Our Conjectures are supported by experiments conducted on the two most widely used model architectures-ResNet and ViT-demonstrating the correlation between fairness and robustness: the higher fairness-gap is, the more the model is sensitive and vulnerable. In addition, our experiments demonstrate the vulnerability of current state-of-the-art approximated unlearning algorithms to adversarial attacks, where their unlearned models suffer a significant drop in accuracy compared to the exact-unlearned models. We claim that our fairness-gap measurement and robustness metric should be used to evaluate the unlearning algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate that unlearning in the intermediate and last layers is sufficient and cost-effective for time and memory complexity.},

abstract = {With the expanding cyber-risk terrain spanning business processes in digitally driven enterprises with critical infrastructure, it is inevitable in time that system process continuity (SPC) will be affected (e.g., via ransomware) for certain inter-dependent processes of such an enterprise, and hamper business continuity. We are interested in the question: how should managers of such enterprises optimize cyber-resilience (i.e., the ability to maintain SPC via absorbing and adapting to an adverse cyber-incident) for any complex networked critical infrastructure (CI) (sub-)system with multiple process functionality components (PFCs)? We prove via an algorithmic graph-theoretic approach that optimizing or approximately optimizing cyber-resilience within a pre-specified enterprise cyber-protection budget in any CI with networked and inter-dependent PFCs is NP-hard. Consequently, we propose a computationally tractable graph-based Monte-Carlo simulation framework to 'optimize' (boost) cyber-resilience within any PFC network by allocating a constrained cyber-protection budget among PFCs in accordance with their Katz centralities in the PFC network.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed significant progress in developing deep learning-based models for automated code completion. Examples of such models include CodeGPT and StarCoder. These models are typically trained from a large amount of source code collected from open-source communities such as GitHub. Although using source code in GitHub has been a common practice for training deep-learning-based models for code completion, it may induce some legal and ethical issues such as copyright infringement. In this paper, we investigate the legal and ethical issues of current neural code completion models by answering the following question: Is my code used to train your neural code completion model?To this end, we tailor a membership inference approach (termed CodeMI) that was originally crafted for classification tasks to a more challenging task of code completion. In particular, since the target code completion models perform as opaque black boxes, preventing access to their training data and parameters, we opt to train multiple shadow models to mimic their behavior. The acquired posteriors from these shadow models are subsequently employed to train a membership classifier. After that, the membership classifier can be effectively employed to deduce the membership status of a given code sample based on the output of a target code completion model. We comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of this adapted approach across a diverse array of neural code completion models, (i.e., LSTM-based, CodeGPT, CodeGen, and StarCoder). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively detects data membership, achieving accuracies of 0.842 and 0.730 for LSTM-based and CodeGPT models, respectively. Interestingly, our experiments also show that the data membership of current large language models of code, e.g., CodeGen and StarCoder, is difficult to detect, leaving ample space for further improvement. Finally, we also try to explain the findings from the perspective of model memorization.},

As web applications increasingly rely on AI for personalization and decision-making, maintaining transparency and accountability becomes essential to prevent bias, misinformation, and unethical practices. By building trust, developers can create safer and more reliable experiences, ultimately promoting user engagement and satisfaction. However, when dataset sizes grow bigger with the rapid web data collection, it is laborious and expensive to obtain perfect data (e.g., clean, safe, and balanced data). As a result, the volume of imperfect data becomes enormous, e.g., web-scale image and speech data with noisy labels, images with specific noise, and long-tail-distributed data. However, standard learning methods assumes that the supervised information is fully correct and intact. Therefore, imperfect data harms the performance of most of the standard learning algorithms, and sometimes even makes existing algorithms break down. In this tutorial, we focus on the algorithmic design of trustworthy AI when facing three types of imperfect data: noisy data, adversarial data, and long-tailed data in the real-world web applications.},

abstract = {Websites are one of the most prolific forms of information and communication technology (ICT). Yet, their potential to contribute to the development of oppressed groups and marginalized populations remains largely understudied. The ICT for development literature often uses simplistic views of identity that ignore the diversity of human experiences arising from the interconnectedness of ethnicity, sexual orientation, and gender. These aspects of identity are interconnected, and ignoring their intersection disregards compounding inequalities contended by sexual and gender minorities who are also ethnic minorities. Motivated by this research gap, this study analyzes 33 Two-Spirit web pages to further our understanding of how websites can contribute to the development of Two-Spirit communities. Two-Spirit is a modern term that recognizes expressions of gender fluidity and sexual diversity advanced by Indigenous Peoples in North America for centuries. An interpretive approach revealed that websites can support the development of Two-Spirit communities through four affordances: open spaces for activism, life stories telling, initiative impact reporting, and enabling access to resources. This paper contributes to the ICT literature on development by explaining how these affordances coalesce into a visibilization mechanism whereby ICT mediates unconstrained expressions of the Two-Spirit identity free of prejudices and colonial distortion.},

Despite the impact of prompt-powered software, little is known about its development process and its relationship to programming. In this work, we argue that some prompts are programs and that the development of prompts is a distinct phenomenon in programming known as “prompt programming”. We develop an understanding of prompt programming using Straussian grounded theory through interviews with 20 developers engaged in prompt development across a variety of contexts, models, domains, and prompt structures. We contribute 15 observations to form a preliminary understanding of current prompt programming practices. For example, rather than building mental models of code, prompt programmers develop mental models of the foundation model (FM)’s behavior on the prompt by interacting with the FM. While prior research shows that experts have well-formed mental models, we find that prompt programmers who have developed dozens of prompts still struggle to develop reliable mental models. Our observations show that prompt programming differs from traditional software development, motivating the creation of prompt programming tools and providing implications for software engineering stakeholders.},

abstract = {For decades, scholars debated the merits between resolving disputes by public adjudications or private settlements. This tension is particularly relevant in misconduct settlements, where wrongdoers can hide behind the confidentiality available in a private settlement. A paradigmatic example of this was the #MeToo movement and the revelation of serial sexual predators sheltered by secret settlements. Using Multi-Party Computation, a cryptographic technique that enables parties to provide private data for computation without giving up confidentiality, we contribute a fully-interwoven statutory-technological system that implements secure reporting of wrongful misconduct settlements, in order to provide oversight statistics to policymakers and to unmask repeatedly-settling parties for investigation. By providing a unique policy option that balances privacy with oversight, our proposal lessens the need to restrict settlement confidentiality, thereby protecting the autonomy of the parties to settle privately, if they so choose. More broadly, our proposal addresses the oversight complaints against settlements by scholars, and advances the discourse on the appropriate roles of adjudication and settlements in resolving disputes.},

abstract = {From a data protection perspective, features like transparency and traceability in data sharing during public procurement and contract execution can simultaneously present weaknesses. This is particularly true for sensitive information, such as personal data, which may be disclosed during procurement processes. To address this challenge, we propose an approach that utilizes Generative Adversarial Models to generate synthetic data alongside Zero-Knowledge Proofs. This method aims to establish the authenticity of the information exchanged in the public procurement process without fully revealing it to all parties involved. By generating synthetic data as a substitute for the original while preserving the context and reliability of the public contract, our information-sharing strategy ensures that all transactions recorded on the blockchain remain private. Only the Zero-Knowledge Proofs are stored on the blockchain, keeping the original information off. Our experiments aimed to confirm that the authenticity of exchanged information in the public procurement process can be demonstrated without complete disclosure to all parties. This work represents a first step in reconciling the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)—a set of rules designed to grant EU citizens greater control over their data—with blockchain technology, which is inherently transparent and immutable.},

abstract = {The evolution of cybersecurity is closelynked to the development and improvement of artificial intelligence (AI). As a key tool for realizing more cybersecure ecosystems, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have evolved tremendously in recent years by integrating machine learning (ML) techniques to detect increasingly sophisticated cybersecurity attacks hidden in big data. However, traditional approaches rely on centralized learning, in which data from end nodes are shared with data centers for analysis. Recently, the application of federated learning (FL) in this context has attracted great interest to come up with collaborative intrusion detection approaches where data does not need to be shared. Due to the recent rise of this field, this work presents a complete, contemporary taxonomy for FL-enabled IDS approaches that stems from a comprehensive survey of the literature from 2018 to 2022. Precisely, our discussion includes an analysis of the main ML models, datasets, aggregation functions, as well as implementation libraries employed by the proposed FL-enabled IDS approaches. On top of everything else, we provide a critical view of the current state of the research around this topic, and describe the main challenges and future directions based on the analysis of the literature and our own experience in this area.},

We have developed an interactive dialogue-based assistant which provides answers in Greek by processing questions in Greek related to an academic domain.  The aim of this research work is the development of a conversational framework which will be domain and language independent and its users would be able to use their natural language to communicate and retrieve information from a problem domain.  We have used the state-of-the-art Rasa framework which supports conversational Artificial Intelligence.  Rasa is a suitable tool for handling natural conversations between a user and a computer, not only because of its ability to detect the intent of its user, but also because it can trigger actions based on the specific user's intent. The key tools for the development of our system are Rasa for natural language understanding, Python for scripting custom actions and Neo4j for efficient data storage and retrieval.  In this research work, we have used a university application domain moreover our approach can be used in other problem domains as well.  So, an advantage of our approach is its independence from the application domain. Our approach can be used in other languages apart the Greek one which has been used as test language. So, another advantage is the language independence of our approach.},

This approach brings together autobiographical making and writing with theorization through a phenomenological lens, specifically using the concept of orientation. We find that attending to our own orientation can be a useful means of tracking how our lived experiences are shaped by practices with data. Our contributions are two-fold: first, we demonstrate how the phenomenological concept of orientation can be used to interpret encounters with data; second, we introduce local data memoirs as a form of affective inquiry with data.},

Using 15 evaluation criteria consolidated and extended from prior HCI design guidelines for human-AI and child-AI interaction, our content and risk analysis revealed that existing apps have not yet leveraged the full potential of existing AI tools, and often fail to rigorously adhere to the best recommended practice. Incorporating feedback from the speech therapy community, we categorized our findings into four areas of ethical concern. To address these concerns, we propose actionable recommendations for app designers, families, and speech therapists to guide more ethical development and safe use of AI-enabled applications for pediatric speech therapy.},

Nexus analysis is used as a research strategy, drawing on multimodal research materials accumulated and gathered during a design and making project conducted with 11–12-year-old pupils. The research lens views social action as an intersection of participants’ histories, their mutual interaction orders and discourses in place. The analysis entails scrutinizing the detailed aspects of identity production that are bound with wider discourses and interactions. Our findings show how identities of a maker, designer, change agent, performer, leader, content producer, and empathizer emerged, and how the competing orientations of being pupils and engaging in design and making that invite diverse types of identity production among the pupils, at the same time gaining agency as designers and makers, and ownership of their designs.},

To demystify this skepticism, we first study in this paper the role of (a) the statistical nature of multiple enterprise cyber-risks contributing to aggregate supply chain risk and (b) the graph structure of the underlying enterprise supply chain network, in the statistical spread of aggregate cyber-risk. We provide statistical tail bounds on the aggregate cyber-risk that a risk managing firm such as a cyber insurer is exposed to in a supply chain. Subsequently, we study the problem of aggregate cyber-risk management by cyber re-insurance firms via portfolio design to optimally diversify aggregate/systemic cyber-risk sourced from multiple CIs insuring enterprises on a supply chain. We propose the first mathematical framework for re-insurers to test the operational sustainability of systemic cyber-risk diversification portfolios with respect to the standard Value-at-Risk (VaR) metric for general aggregate cyber risk distributions. We also propose a statistical copula methodology to make systemic cyber-risk portfolio diversification sustainable for re-insurers in scenarios where the sustainability test fails. We validate our theory via Monte Carlo simulations.},

This paper investigates the design and implementation of an intelligent monitoring system that leverages cloud computing and IoT to enhance the management efficiency and safety of these vehicles. By combining the robust storage and processing capabilities of cloud computing with the extensive sensing and real-time communication features of IoT, a comprehensive monitoring platform is developed. The system utilizes a variety of sensors and network devices to gather real-time data on operational status, location, and environmental conditions of special vehicles, which is then transmitted to the cloud for analysis and processing. The system not only supports real-time monitoring, data storage and historical query functions, but also uses intelligent algorithms to realize anomaly detection, early warning and decision support, which effectively improves the safety management level of special vehicles. The research shows that the intelligent monitoring system for special vehicles based on cloud computing and Internet of things can effectively solve the problems of information island and data processing lag in traditional monitoring methods, and improve the timeliness and accuracy of monitoring. Through the actual case analysis, the system has achieved good application results in special vehicle scheduling, maintenance, fault warning and other aspects, and has important promotion value. This paper offers a theoretical foundation and practical insights for the optimized development of intelligent monitoring systems for special vehicles.},

With more and more behavior tracking techniques (e.g., fitness trackers, mixed reality) entering our everyday lives, more of our behavior is captured and processed. Hence, techniques to protect individuals’ privacy against unwanted inferences are required before such data is processed. To consolidate knowledge in this area, we are the first to systematically review suggested anonymization techniques for behavioral biometric data. We taxonomize and compare existing solutions regarding privacy goals, conceptual operation, advantages, and limitations. Our categorization allows for the comparison of anonymization techniques across different behavioral biometric traits. We review anonymization techniques for the behavioral biometric traits of voice, gait, hand motions, eye gaze, heartbeat (ECG), and brain activity (EEG). Our analysis shows that some behavioral traits (e.g., voice) have received much attention, while others (e.g., eye gaze, brain activity) are mostly neglected. We also find that the evaluation methodology of behavioral anonymization techniques can be further improved.},

While autonomous vessels (AVs) offer the potential to significantly reduce the number of accidents caused by human error, their successful integration into mixed environments hinges on their ability to navigate complex interactions with manual vessels (MVs) effectively. We study the dynamics of interaction between AVs and MVs under the lens of cooperative and non-cooperative behavior using a cooperative game theory model in a connected mixed environment. Different risk perceptions of AVs and MVs based on ship domains were considered for the estimation of collision risk for different vessel types in mixed traffic. Simulation results validate the proposed collision avoidance strategy in multiple scenarios, demonstrating that the cooperative game approach can help AVs to dynamically adapt their trajectories and effectively obtain collision-free paths amid complex interactions with various encountered vessels.},

abstract = {As the number and sophistication of cyber attacks have increased, threat hunting has become a critical aspect of active security, enabling proactive detection and mitigation of threats before they cause significant harm. Open-source cyber threat intelligence (OSCTI) is a valuable resource for threat hunters, however, it often comes in unstructured formats that require further manual analysis. Previous studies aimed at automating OSCTI analysis are limited since (1) they failed to provide actionable outputs, (2) they did not take advantage of images present in OSCTI sources, and (3) they focused on on-premises environments, overlooking the growing importance of cloud environments. To address these gaps, we propose LLMCloudHunter, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate generic-signature detection rule candidates from textual and visual OSCTI data. We evaluated the quality of the rules generated by the proposed framework using 20 annotated real-world cloud threat reports. The results show that our framework achieved a precision of 83% and recall of 99% for the task of accurately extracting API calls made by the threat actor and a precision of 99% with a recall of 97% for IoCs. Additionally, 99.18% of the generated detection rule candidates were successfully compiled and converted into Splunk queries.},

abstract = {Satellites play a crucial role in the global infrastructure of internet communication, commerce, and society. However, they are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, with distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks being among the most prevalent threats. These attacks disrupt normal operations by flooding a network's resources. In response to the increasing frequency of such threats, there is a growing need for predictive methods of detecting bad actor signals. This paper proposes a stochastic logging system designed to capture and analyze key metrics associated with DDoS attacks on Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, including uplink and downlink speeds, spectrogram speeds, and latency. By logging these measures, the system aims to identify abnormal signal activity. The methodology involves generating synthetic data representative of LEO satellite communication metrics and validating these values against predefined acceptable ranges. These datasets could then be used to develop methods for detecting and mitigating attacks on satellite networks.},

While technologies like RFID, WIFI, UWB offer potential solutions for portable, non-contact material identification, the need to place targets in fixed positions for identification has limited the flexibility of material sensing. In this paper, we first innovatively apply the Range-Angle heatmap (RAheatmap) to effectively represent the distance, placement angle, and inherent material attributes to pave the way for precise material identification. Then propose an innovative system called Material-ID to utilize Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) millimeter wave (mmWave) radar for material sensing. Additionally, we endow the system with cross-domain adaptability to make it tailored to identify material reflection attributes and minimize the effects of variables such as distance and placement angle. The experiments prove the effectiveness of the proposed system.},

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) poses a major threat to airspace security and privacy protection. However, existing UAV identification systems face the limitations of feature extraction quality degradation under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, and the average delay of traditional tracking algorithms is difficult to meet the real-time requirements due to high computational complexity. To address these issues, this paper proposes mmRTD, a real-time identification and tracking system for non-cooperative UAV sensing using mmWave radar. To solve the problem of serious feature extraction distortion in low SNR environment, this paper proposes a dynamic period adjustment mechanism driven by spectrum volatility to significantly improve the quality of feature extraction under low SNR conditions. To solve the problem of insufficient real-time performance of traditional tracking methods, this paper proposes a lightweight frame-based tracking framework through the target state detection method to solve the real-time bottleneck caused by high-dimensional signal processing of traditional methods. The experimental results show that the detection accuracy of mmRTD reaches 97.2% within a range of 40 m. In particular, the first detection time of mmRTD is two orders of magnitude higher than that of the traditional scheme, which verifies its potential for real-time identification in complex scenes.},

Despite the abundance of information sources, the digital age overwhelms individuals with excess, often inaccurate information. Patients primarily trust medical professionals, highlighting the need for expert-endorsed health information. However, increased patient loads on experts has led to reduced communication time, impacting information sharing. To address this gap, we developed CataractBot1. CataractBot answers cataract surgery related questions instantly using an LLM to query a curated knowledge base, and provides expert-verified responses asynchronously. It has multimodal and multilingual capabilities. In an in-the-wild deployment study with 49 patients and attendants, 4 doctors, and 2 patient coordinators, CataractBot demonstrated potential, providing anytime accessibility, saving time, accommodating diverse literacy levels, alleviating power differences, and adding a privacy layer between patients and doctors. Users reported that their trust in the system was established through expert verification. Broadly, our results could inform future work on expert-mediated LLM bots.},

Here, we aim to leverage Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to expand limited datasets with synthetic data specific to disaster scenarios, evacuation routes, airspace considerations, and the impact of real-time weather events, enabling robust simulation of UAM deployment in disaster evacuations. We identified two applicable scenarios: i) UAM for Extreme Weather Emergency Evacuation and ii) Hospital Evacuations using VTOLs as use cases and illustrated their impact.

In this study, we propose a novel Interactive Fiction (IF) framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to encourage perspective-taking and reduce biases against these stigmatized yet essential roles. Through an experiment with participants (n = 100) across four such occupations, we observed a significant increase in participants’ understanding of these occupations, as well as a high level of empathy and a strong sense of connection to individuals in these roles. Additionally, qualitative interviews with participants (n = 15) revealed that the LLM-based perspective-taking IF enhanced immersion, deepened emotional resonance and empathy toward “dirty work,” and allowed participants to experience a sense of professional fulfillment in these occupations. However, participants also highlighted ongoing challenges, such as limited contextual details generated by the LLM and the unintentional reinforcement of existing stereotypes. Overall, our findings underscore that an LLM-based perspective-taking IF framework offers a promising and scalable strategy for mitigating stigma and promoting social equity in marginalized professions.},

Both challenges are sometimes addressed by the presence of a machine-parseable API specification (such as an OpenAPI specification). However, most web applications lack such a specification—making automatic testing hard.We tackle both challenges by introducing Trailblazer, a practical end-to-end workflow for testing web APIs—regardless of whether a specification is available. Trailblazer operates by (1) capturing API requests initiated by the client side of a web application during normal interactions, (2) identifying endpoints and inferring request payload structure using the collected data, and then (3) generating new test payloads. To the best of our knowledge, Trailblazer is the first of its kind to combine generation-based and mutation-based fuzzing in web API testing.We evaluated Trailblazer against popular open-source content management systems, found that the code coverage it achieved, was comparable to the coverage obtained using official OpenAPI specification. Trailblazer uncovered seven unique new bugs across the tested systems, with two already fixed and four confirmed.},

year = {2025},
publisher = {AAAI Press},
abstract = {Popular and news media often portray teenagers with sensationalism, as both a risk to society and at risk from society. As AI begins to absorb some of the epistemic functions of traditional media, we study how teenagers in two countries speaking two languages: 1) are depicted by AI, and 2) how they would prefer to be depicted. Specifically, we study the biases about teenagers learned by static word embeddings (SWEs) and generative language models (GLMs), comparing these with the perspectives of adolescents living in the U.S. and Nepal. We find English-language SWEs associate teenagers with societal problems, and more than 50% of the 1,000 words most associated with teenagers in the pretrained GloVe SWE reflect such problems. Given prompts about teenagers, 30% of outputs from GPT2-XL and 29% from LLaMA-2-7B GLMs discuss societal problems, most commonly violence, but also drug use, mental illness, and sexual taboo. Nepali models, while not free of such associations, are less dominated by social problems. Data from workshops with N=13 U.S. adolescents and N=18 Nepalese adolescents show that AI presentations are disconnected from teenage life, which revolves around activities like school and friendship. Participant ratings of how well 20 trait words describe teens are decorrelated from SWE associations, with Pearson's ρ=.02, n.s. in English FastText and ρ=.06, n.s. in GloVe; and ρ=.06, n.s. in Nepali FastText and ρ=-.23, n.s. in GloVe. U.S. participants suggested AI could fairly present teens by highlighting diversity, while Nepalese participants centered positivity. Participants were optimistic that, if it learned from adolescents, rather than media sources, AI could help mitigate stereotypes. Our work offers an understanding of the ways SWEs and GLMs misrepresent a developmentally vulnerable group and provides a template for less sensationalized characterization.},

abstract = {I share the results of a quantitative multiple-choice questionnaire conducted in the Republic of Ireland in which N=281 women revealed the multiple ways Cyber-located Sexual Violence (CLSV) victimization psychologically harms them. CLSV sits at the intersection of technology, cyberspace, and sexual violence, and includes cyberflashing, Image-based Sexual Abuse, cyberstalking, and unwanted threats, comments, and sexual requests (e-bile). While CLSV harms victim-survivors in multiple ways, including physically embodied and financial harms, the psychological harm of CLSV victimization is considerable for some victim-survivors, warranting a specific focus in this paper. The findings demonstrate that CLSV inflicts various psychological harms on the 281 women respondents, impacting their mental health negatively, their trust in others, and how safe they feel. To these findings, I add further depth by reflecting on my experiences of being psychologically harmed as a witness to the impact CLSV has on women and the threat of potential CLSV in my life. These reflections outline how CLSV is psychologically harmful not only to victim-survivors but also to their supporters, friends, family, communities, and wider societies. This paper contributes a consideration of the psychological harms of CLSV that existing literature on technology-facilitated abuses has not yet considered in the Irish context. As CLSV negatively impacts different women in different contexts and social locations, I recommend further intersectional research on the harms of CLSV in Ireland and beyond, specifically focusing on establishing similarities and differences in different contexts.},

However, this premise can only be achieved if information asymmetry is eliminated and there is equal and simultaneous access to consistent and transparent data by all participants in the network. In this paper, we explore various DLT information symmetry challenges, including theoretical fundamentals and practical hurdles in relation to the technology stack. We explore the potential of using DLT to facilitate mutual knowledge sharing in E-Commerce scenarios via Proofs of Information Symmetry (PoIS). We found that PoIS have the ability to significantly improve trust between transacting parties, specifically in the context of producer-consumer relationships and associated investor-asset management and contract obligations. In addition, we discovered that the effectiveness of PoIS strongly depends on the presence of a reliable notification system. Our study found that the utilisation of Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proofs can improve confidence among transaction partners, particularly in situations where safeguarding trade secrets or maintaining the privacy of agents is necessary. Our results are demonstrated by deriving from testing PoIS in a commercial context that includes a vehicle under a short-term lease management setup. This evaluation demonstrates the benefit of a contextual ZK-proof that maintains the individual privacy of trading partners.},

abstract = {As digital content becomes increasingly ubiquitous, the need for robust watermark removal techniques has grown due to the inadequacy of existing embedding techniques, which lack robustness. This paper introduces a novel Saliency-Aware Diffusion Reconstruction (SADRE) framework for watermark elimination on the web, combining adaptive noise injection, region-specific perturbations, and advanced diffusion-based reconstruction. SADRE disrupts embedded watermarks by injecting targeted noise into latent representations guided by saliency masks although preserving essential image features. A reverse diffusion process ensures high-fidelity image restoration, leveraging adaptive noise levels determined by watermark strength. Our framework is theoretically grounded with stability guarantees and achieves robust watermark removal across diverse scenarios. Empirical evaluations on stateof-the-art (SOTA) watermarking techniques demonstrate SADRE's superiority in balancing watermark disruption and image quality. SADRE sets a new benchmark for watermark elimination, offering a flexible and reliable solution for real-world web content. Code is available on https://github.com/inzamamulDU/SADRE.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of Internet technology, the dissemination of malicious documents has become increasingly rampant, and traditional detection methods for malicious documents have failed to meet the current complex and diverse security requirements. The high-dimensional features of malicious documents, including instruction-level, function-level, PE header information, and byte-level code, pose challenges for detection. This paper deeply investigates the application of high-dimensional feature fusion and machine learning algorithms in malicious document detection. Through feature extraction and fusion techniques, key features of malicious documents are extracted from multiple dimensions, and advanced machine learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), and LightGBM are used to model and analyze the fused high-dimensional features. Experimental results show that the combination of high-dimensional feature fusion and machine learning algorithms significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of malicious document detection, providing effective means to address increasingly complex network security threats.},

abstract = {Undergraduate computer science programs worldwide struggle to attract and retain underrepresented students for many reasons. Culture, stereotype threats, uneven gender and racial representations, lack of role models, and uncertain career prospects for minority groups are among the many reasons behind this situation. Many computer science programs are trying to change course through strategies to foster equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI), aimed at improving outreach, recruitment, admissions, and retention of underrepresented students. EDI approaches may also include modifications to the undergraduate computer science curriculum. However, if not properly planned, these modifications risk amplifying existing stereotypes rather than producing positive change [38]. In this study, through an extensive literature review, a rigorous curriculum analysis of 49 computer science programs across the globe, and qualitative and quantitative analysis of surveys and interviews bringing in the voices of 613 students and 30 educators participating from around the world, we explore equity, diversity, and inclusion in the computer science curriculum. We highlight the role of inclusive content and course design, discuss program flexibility, and the impact of inclusive courses and program design in attracting and retaining historically marginalized students. Finally, we provide concrete steps to make computing science undergraduate curricula more appealing to a diverse audience.},

abstract = {Multi-level simulation setups are crucial to train individuals with different learning needs in the same virtual environment. For users at the group command level in virtual tactical simulations for defense/military, tasks simulated at the unit (lower) levels are usually executed autonomously. The contribution of this paper is to detail how these autonomous agent tasks are performed in a chain of actions and commands that include the possibility of high-rank users' interaction with the simulations. The work reports on the experience of designing and implementing an autonomy architecture for an agent-based simulation system called SIS-ASTROS. In this system, autonomous tasks executed by simulated artillery batteries are grounded on the exposition and controlled execution of the API of the SIS-ASTROS simulator. In a user-friendly specification, simulation analysts can provide scripts for doctrine-based agent behaviors, where an autonomy simulator module executes these scripts to improve the overall training experience.},

Similarly, each IoT device may have one or multiple identities in multiple metaverses. An identity of an IoT thing typically includes a unique identifier and a corresponding identity document. While having a single unique identity for an IoT device across multiple metaverses can offer advantages, there are challenges: how to identify, authenticate, and authorize the IoT devices as they roam across different metaverse platforms, and how to enable trustworthy shared storage systems to interact with each other to support identity interoperability across storages. This paper describes identity interoperability for things across metaverse platforms and provides a reference framework. By implementing identity interoperability of things across metaverse platforms, it is possible to significantly enhance the user experience in the metaverse, promote data sharing, and build an open, inclusive, and healthy metaverse ecosystem.},

In this paper, we introduce Crimson, a distributed system designed to continuously detect cryptocurrency investment scam websites as they are created in the wild. During the first 8 months of 2024, Crimson processed approximately 6 billion domain names and classified 43,572 unique cryptocurrency investment scam websites in real-time. Beyond detection, we provide insights into the design and infrastructure of these websites that can help users recognize scam patterns and assist hosting providers in detecting and blocking such sites. Furthermore, we investigate the inclusion of our detected scam websites in block-lists used by popular web browsers and applications, finding that the vast majority of these websites were absent. On the financial side, by analyzing the transactions incoming to scammer wallets on 6.7% of the sites detected by Crimson, we observe an estimated lower bound of 2.04M USD in losses due to cryptocurrency investment scams.},

abstract = {Over the past two decades, the commercial landscape has undergone a transformation, shifting from traditional marketing methods to digital and internet-based platforms. This shift, while boosting economic potential, has also made the digital world a prime target for cybercriminals. Online scams and fraud have become prevalent, affecting individuals and businesses globally. Financial losses from cyber fraud in India have surged significantly, rising from Rs 69.7 crore in FY 2023 to Rs 177.05 crore in FY 2024. This paper presents a detailed analysis of various forms of online scams and frauds, explaining their core methodologies and the severe impacts these schemes have on consumers. From phishing and identity theft to sophisticated financial fraud, the study dives deep into how these fraudulent activities evolve and adapt to target individuals and businesses alike. The paper also offers a thorough taxonomy of each type of scam to provide a structured understanding of the different fraud strategies. The paper highlights a range of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods that are essential in identifying fraudulent patterns in real-time. In addition to these detection methods, the paper also outlines several ML/DL-based prevention strategies aimed at proactively stopping scams before they cause harm. Ultimately, by promoting advanced detection and prevention methods, this document aims to contribute to the development of a safer digital ecosystem.},

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) models can leak information about users, and differential privacy (DP) provides a rigorous way to bound that leakage under a given budget. This DP budget can be regarded as a new type of computing resource in workloads of multiple ML models training on user data. Once it is used, the DP budget is forever consumed. Therefore, it is crucial to allocate it most efficiently to train as many models as possible. This paper presents a scheduler for the privacy resources that optimizes for efficiency. We formulate privacy scheduling as a new type of multidimensional knapsack problem, called privacy knapsack, which maximizes DP budget efficiency. We show that privacy knapsack is NP-hard, hence practical algorithms are necessarily approximate. We develop an approximation algorithm for privacy knapsack, DPack, and evaluate it on microbenchmarks and on a new, synthetic private-ML workload we developed from the Alibaba ML cluster trace. We show that DPack: (1) often approaches the efficiency-optimal schedule, (2) consistently schedules more tasks compared to a state-of-the-art privacy scheduling algorithm that focused on fairness instead of efficiency (1.3-1.7\texttimes{} in Alibaba, 1.0-2.6X in microbenchmarks), but (3) sacrifices some level of fairness for efficiency. Using DPack, DP ML operators should be able to train more models on the same amount of user data while offering the same privacy guarantee to their users.},

It describes NLP4RE, a tool by Softeam for requirements semantic similarity search. It has been applied for a use case from the railway industry within the AIDOaRT project.

abstract = {Systemic enterprise cyber risk typically arises when a single (software) vulnerability common across many enterprise computing devices across the globe is exploited by adversaries, and results in catastrophic aggregate cyber-loss consequences to be borne by CRM entities. Examples of such vulnerability exploitation incidents include the Log4j and SolarWinds cyber-attacks. The important question we ask here is: how hard is it to discover these 'single vulnerabilities' in enterprise information systems? We prove that answering this question is NP-hard. Alternatively, leave alone humans, even a computer via cyber-attack simulations might not (in the worst case) discover in finite time such vulnerabilities. Consequently, CRM entities can only expect and prepare for an inevitable catastrophic systemic cyber-incident in time rather than predict the likelihood of one. Likewise, we propose the policy implications of our research for the CRM market stakeholders and elucidate relevant action items for effective systemic enterprise CRM.},

abstract = {Cross-chain bridges are essential decentralized applications (DApps) to facilitate interoperability between different blockchain networks. Unlike regular DApps, the functionality of cross-chain bridges relies on the collaboration of information both on and off the chain, which exposes them to a wider risk of attacks. According to our statistics, attacks on cross-chain bridges have resulted in losses of nearly 4.3 billion since 2021. Therefore, it is particularly necessary to understand and detect attacks on cross-chain bridges. In this paper, we collect the largest number of cross-chain bridge attack incidents to date, including 49 attacks that occurred between June 2021 and September 2024, of which 22 were attacks on cross-chain bridge business logic. Our analysis reveal that attacks against cross-chain business logic cause significantly more damage than those that do not. These cross-chain attacks exhibit different patterns compared to normal transactions in terms of call structure, which effectively indicates potential attack behaviors. Given the significant losses in these cases and the scarcity of related research, this paper aims to detect attacks against cross-chain business logic, and propose the BridgeGuard tool. Specifically, BridgeGuard models cross-chain transactions from a graph perspective, and employs a two-stage detection framework comprising global and local graph mining to identify attack patterns in cross-chain transactions. We conduct multiple experiments on the datasets with 203 attack transactions and 40,000 normal cross-chain transactions. The results show that BridgeGuard's reported recall score is 36.32% higher than that of state-of-the-art tools and can detect unknown attack transactions.},

abstract = {The Sterile Processing Department (SPD) is an essential component of hospitals and healthcare facilities. It ensures the cleanliness, sterility, and proper functioning of medical instruments. A well-designed SPD workflow can improve productivity, reduce operating room (OR) delays, and enhance patient safety. Developing a simulation model for sterile processing is challenging because of the complex interactions between different units, such as decontamination, assembly, sterilization, storage, and case-cart preparation. Moreover, the dynamic nature of the surgical volume, tray requirements, and staffing dynamics further complicate the modeling process. Furthermore, missing instruments, bioburden, and nonfunctional instruments add another layer of complexity. Therefore, the additional tray request from OR personnel results in undue strain on the SPD's inventory of trays and its ability to process dirty trays and instruments. This study focuses on the following challenges: duplicate tray requests, replacement tray needs, tray representation, on-time start pressures, and staff shortages.},

However, current reports lack grounding in regulations and often focus on specific aspects like privacy in relation to AI systems, without addressing the real-world uses of these systems. Moreover, there is no systematic effort to design and evaluate these reports with both AI practitioners and AI compliance experts. To address this gap, we conducted an iterative co-design process with 14 AI practitioners and 6 AI compliance experts and proposed a template for impact assessment reports grounded in the EU AI Act, NIST's AI Risk Management Framework, and ISO 42001 AI Management System. We evaluated the template by producing an impact assessment report for an AI-based meeting companion at a major tech company. A user study with 8 AI practitioners from the same company and 5 AI compliance experts from industry and academia revealed that our template effectively provides necessary information for impact assessments and documents the broad impacts of AI systems. Participants envisioned using the template not only at the pre-deployment stage for compliance but also as a tool to guide the design stage of AI uses.},

abstract = {The number and diversity of embedded Field- Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) Multi-Processor Systems On Chip (MPSoCs) in modern satellites is increasing, and so is the complexity and cost of using them efficiently (i.e., optimally exploiting the available resources) and safely (i.e., complying with the applicable safety and availability constraints). Programming languages traditionally used in critical real-time systems have yet to be designed to address the extreme parallelism of modern platforms. To address this limitation, OpenMP, the de-facto standard for exploiting parallelism in shared-memory systems in the HPC domain, is increasingly considered a suitable solution in critical domains. OpenMP implements a comprehensive set of computation models (e.g., data and task parallelism, host and accelerator support), comes with an extensive set of assets (e.g., tools, libraries), and supports a large set of CPU and accelerator devices (e.g., GR740, MPPA, NVIDIA Jetson and Xilinx Ultrascale+). Despite preliminary analysis proving the productivity and efficiency of OpenMP in the space, automotive and railway domains, some challenges must be addressed. This paper introduces LIONESS, a project funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) proposing an advanced OpenMP framework that combines enhancements in the parallel programming model with adapted compiler and runtime systems to provide benefits along two axes: (1) resilience, through providing fault-tolerance techniques, and (2) heterogeneity, through enabling the design space exploration of multiple deployment configurations considering multi-cores and accelerator devices.},

abstract = {In recent years, graph representation learning has achieved remarkable success while suffering from low-quality data problems. As a mature technology to improve data quality in computer vision, data augmentation has also attracted increasing attention in graph domain. To advance research in this emerging direction, this survey provides a comprehensive review and summary of existing graph data augmentation (GDAug) techniques. Specifically, this survey first provides an overview of various feasible taxonomies and categorizes existing GDAug studies based on multi-scale graph elements. Subsequently, for each type of GDAug technique, this survey formalizes standardized technical definition, discuss the technical details, and provide schematic illustration. The survey also reviews domain-specific graph data augmentation techniques, including those for heterogeneous graphs, temporal graphs, spatio-temporal graphs, and hypergraphs. In addition, this survey provides a summary of available evaluation metrics and design guidelines for graph data augmentation. Lastly, it outlines the applications of GDAug at both the data and model levels, discusses open issues in the field, and looks forward to future directions. The latest advances in GDAug are summarized in GitHub.1},

Data enclaves make it possible to conduct analysis on large-scale and higher-risk data sets, while protecting the privacy of the individuals whose data is included in the data sets, thus mitigating risks around data disclosure. In this article, we provide a post-mortem on the MORF (MOoc Replication Framework) 2.1 infrastructure, a data enclave expected to sunset and be replaced in the upcoming years, reviewing the core factors that reduced its usefulness for the community. We discuss challenges to researchers in terms of usability, including challenges involving learning to use core technologies, working with data that cannot be directly viewed, debugging, and working with restricted outputs. Our post-mortem discusses possibilities for ways that future infrastructures could get past these challenges.},

Pati is a partition-style personal device that visualizes availability for F2F interruptions and Bellio is a shared interface that allows users to send notifications to their colleagues from a distance. Our three-week in field study with four groups of participants reveals that examining the process of F2F interruptions helps determine the importance of the interruption, and the physical distance provided by Pati and Bellio naturally allowed time to prepare for conversations. We also identified how the visualized availability is considered after an interruption begins. Our findings imply considerations in designing systems to support coordinating social interaction in work environments.},

abstract = {As we transition towards Web 3.0, the role of blockchain technology in education becomes increasingly pivotal, particularly in the management of digital identities and assets. This evolution emphasizes the importance of decentralization, enabling secure and trustworthy interactions among users while fostering innovation in educational frameworks. Despite recent advancements brought about by eIDAS 2.0 and the adoption of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) models, significant challenges remain in establishing cohesive European standards for digital identities. In response to these challenges, we introduce M.U.St (My University Studies), a proof-of-concept decentralized application (Dapp) aimed at enhancing academic credential management by leveraging the capabilities of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Soulbound Tokens (SBTs). Based on emerging technologies, our project seeks to empower users with control over their own digital identities, allowing them to securely manage and share their academic credentials across various Web 3.0 applications. To this end this paper presents a blockchain-based solution for decentralized identity and asset management in education, highlighting the interoperability feature of identities. We argue that adopting such a model not only improves the security and privacy of user data but, also, facilitates a more inclusive and accessible educational environment, ultimately paving the way for a more decentralized future in higher education.},

abstract = {The distributed computing paradigm of edge computing effectively addresses the challenges of data transmission delay and data privacy security. With the increasing popularity of IoT devices and 5G networks, edge computing has a broader range of applications. The advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) technology enables the realization of edge intelligence, which conducts data processing and analysis on edge devices to avoid excessive data transmission to the cloud, enhance system response speed, and protect user data privacy. In various edge intelligent systems like smart homes and autonomous driving, multimodal data plays a crucial role. However, missing modalities in such systems may lead to model failure in real-world environments. To tackle this issue, we propose a tensor-empowered modality reconstruction network (TMRN) that utilizes an end-to-end variational autoencoder for reconstructing missing modal data. This approach effectively enhances model robustness while reducing model size and training complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a supervised method for feature reconstruction to better align with the true distribution of missing modal data by leveraging tensor feature fusion and label supervision techniques. Additionally, we design a task information disentanglement module to make multimodal representations more relevant to specific tasks by effectively separating task-relevant from task-irrelevant information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TMRN achieves competitive performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.},

Recently, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) published a new series of standards, ISO 23247 Digital Twin Framework for Manufacturing, to provide guidance for implementing these aspects of digital twins in a manufacturing environment. This paper provides a case study of using the ISO framework to build a digital twin of a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine tool. This research demonstrates how the ISO standard, system modeling, machining data standards, messaging protocols, data processing, and data visualization tools support the creation of a digital twin of a CNC machine tool. The approach of this paper can be used by manufacturers to implement their digital twin applications.},

This process is demanding due to the significant time and human effort required for labeling new data. While test selection methods alleviate manual labor by labeling and evaluating only a subset of data while meeting testing criteria, we observe that such methods with reported promising results are simply evaluated, e.g., testing on original test data. The question arises: are they always reliable? In this paper, we explore when and to what extent test selection methods fail. First, we identify potential pitfalls of 11 selection methods based on their construction. Second, we conduct a study to empirically confirm the existence of these pitfalls. Furthermore, we demonstrate how pitfalls can break the reliability of these methods. Concretely, methods for fault detection suffer from data that are: 1) correctly classified but uncertain, or 2) misclassified but confident. Remarkably, the test relative coverage achieved by such methods drops by up to 86.85%. Besides, methods for performance estimation are sensitive to the choice of intermediate-layer output. The effectiveness of such methods can be even worse than random selection when using an inappropriate layer.},

The analysis of transition behaviors in public organizations could help in understanding the duality between the need for continuity of services provided to the community, and the cyclical nature of risk and crisis management. This study uniquely highlights the transitions occurring when organizations need to stop day-to-day activities to focus on responding to a crisis while continuing to provide services to their communities. We focus on the use of social media analytics as a support system to study transitions and, with the objective to gain an insight into how sociotechnical systems navigate through periods of crisis and non-crisis, we leverage individual experiences of use of social media as a source of information in public service organizations and developers of social media analytics support tools. In doing so, we employed a process study approach, conducted semi-structured interviews, and used thematic analysis to trace patterns of transitions between crisis and non-crisis states. Furthermore, we formulate five signals that public organizations exhibit to illustrate and guide organizational transition behaviors. The main contribution of this study is the explanation and conceptualization of how transitions happen by framing social media as a support information system. In addition, we highlight the return to a new steady state, an overlooked area of organizational transitions and continuity. Our study will help streamline processes of continuity in organizations and inspires the design and improvement of current and future support systems. Future research could apply and extend our propositions to other support systems such as geospatial technologies, robots, and even artificial intelligence.},

A major challenge in adopting DLT is the conflicting demands on data transparency for improved integrity, against hiding commercially sensitive data. To address this, some industry ecosystems use multiple ledgers shared only between relevant parties rather than using a single distributed ledger across the entire ecosystem. The design problem for this is: What parties should share which ledgers, and what data should be on those ledgers? In this paper, we propose a method employing a Design Structure Matrix (DSM) and Domain Mapping Matrix (DMM) to derive candidate shared ledger combinations for industry ecosystems. The method also indicates, for certain data, centralized web services or point-to-point messages may be more suitable than shared ledgers. We discuss our experiences with applying this method while developing a prototype for an agricultural traceability platform. We also present a genetic-algorithm-based DSM and DMM clustering technique to derive candidate shared ledger combinations.},

abstract = {Abstractive dialogue summarization is the task of distilling conversations into informative and concise summaries. Although focused reviews have been conducted on this topic, there is a lack of comprehensive work that details the core challenges of dialogue summarization, unifies the differing understanding of the task, and aligns proposed techniques, datasets, and evaluation metrics with the challenges. This article summarizes the research on Transformer-based abstractive summarization for English dialogues by systematically reviewing 1262 unique research papers published between 2019 and 2024, relying on the Semantic Scholar and DBLP databases. We cover the main challenges present in dialog summarization (i.e., language, structure, comprehension, speaker, salience, and factuality) and link them to corresponding techniques such as graph-based approaches, additional training tasks, and planning strategies, which typically overly rely on BART-based encoder-decoder models. Recent advances in training methods have led to substantial improvements in language-related challenges. However, challenges such as comprehension, factuality, and salience remain difficult and present significant research opportunities. We further investigate how these approaches are typically analyzed, covering the datasets for the subdomains of dialogue (e.g., meeting, customer service, and medical), the established automatic metrics (e.g., ROUGE), and common human evaluation approaches for assigning scores and evaluating annotator agreement. We observe that only a few datasets (i.e., SAMSum, AMI, DialogSum) are widely used. Despite its limitations, the ROUGE metric is the most commonly used, while human evaluation, considered the gold standard, is frequently reported without sufficient detail on the inter-annotator agreement and annotation guidelines. Additionally, we discuss the possible implications of the recently explored large language models and conclude that our described challenge taxonomy remains relevant despite a potential shift in relevance and difficulty.},

abstract = {This article examines the technological literacies reflected by participants in the transnational "White Paper Movement"/"A4 Revolution" in the Chinese diaspora, against the Chinese government's stringent "dynamic zero-COVID" policy. The analysis reveals how protestors engaged with the technological literacy framework of Hovde and Renguette (2017): functional and conceptual; critical and evaluative, in layered and interconnected ways. But these literacy skills are also extended tactically where they must not only know how to use technologies well, but also understand how a technology works enough in order to use it subversively. Thus, this article proposes a tactical technological literacy to contribute to the theorization of a "post-digital" life-especially in transnational activism contexts-where not only do people have to consider how (not) to use technologies (in the broadest sense) in both online and offline spaces but also how technologies may impose constraints and oppression on their daily life. The article ends with some pedagogical implications on how to foster a tactical technological literacy in TPC classrooms.},

Several important themes emerge in this dataset, including the need to contextualise computing education.In the second part of this report we investigate contextualisation further. We present a pilot study, grounded in the literature review, of the development of course materials, sample code, and programming assignments for introductory programming, contextualised for six African countries: Botswana, Egypt, Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, and Zambia. We include the materials, report on a preliminary evaluation of the materials by fellow educators in African countries, and suggest a process by which other educators could develop materials for their local contexts.},

abstract = {Digital Twins (DTs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling Large Complex Systems (LCSs). Their strength lies in the detailed virtual models that enable accurate predictions, presenting challenges in traditionally centralized approaches due to the immense scale and decentralized ownership of LCSs. This paper proposes a framework that leverages the prevalence of individual DTs within LCSs. By facilitating the exchange of decisions and predictions, this framework fosters collaboration among autonomous DTs, enhancing performance. Additionally, a trust-based mechanism is introduced to improve system robustness against poor decision-making within the collaborative network. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated in a virtual power plant (VPP) scenario. The evaluation results confirm the system's objectives across various test cases and show scalability for large deployments.},

abstract = {The rapid evolution of e-commerce has propelled personalization to the forefront of digital marketing strategies. This study investigates the transformative impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) on e-commerce personalization, examining their effects on customer engagement, sales performance, and long-term market dynamics. We conducted a comprehensive econometric analysis using panel data from diverse e-commerce platforms over multiple years. Employing difference-in-differences models and instrumental variable approaches, we isolated the specific impact of AI and ML-driven personalization on key performance metrics. Our research encompassed various product categories and market segments to assess heterogeneous effects across the e-commerce landscape. The implementation of AI and ML-driven personalization strategies led to statistically significant increases in conversion rates (10-15%) and customer lifetime value (20-30%). These insights have significant implications for e-commerce strategy, investment decisions, and regulatory frameworks in an increasingly AI-driven economy. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on AI economics, providing empirical evidence of its impact in e-commerce. It offers valuable guidance for practitioners in optimizing personalization strategies and informs policy discussions surrounding digital market regulation, data privacy, and technological competition.},

Recognizing the breadth of this year's program, we are publishing two sets of proceedings: one dedicated to research track papers, the Web4Good track, and keynotes; and a companion proceedings featuring the Demo Paper Track, Short Paper Track, PhD Symposium, Special Day, Resource Track, and History of Web sessions. Through this rich assortment of activities, we aim to foster a vibrant community where delegates can share ideas, forge collaborations, and cultivate a sustainable, inclusive environment.Marking its 34th edition, WWW'25 welcomes more than 1,000 industry and academic experts eager to shape the future of Web technologies and applications. The conference logo, depicting the Sydney Harbour Bridge, symbolizes the Web's key function of "connecting" people and information. Originally founded at CERN in 1994 as the International World Wide Web Conference (WWW), this event has long been the leading venue for research, development, standards, and applications related to the Web.Over the years, WWW has introduced important breakthroughs, from The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Web Search Engine in 1998-which heralded Google-to the EigenTrust algorithm in 2003 and the YAGO knowledge base in 2007. In the period between 2024 and 2025, large language models (LLMs) have significantly influenced countless industries and everyday life, prompting fundamental shifts in the Web ecosystem. We anticipate that the research and discussions at this year's conference will spark further breakthroughs in this rapidly evolving field.Continuing the tradition of depth and diversity, WWW'25 accepted 26 workshops and 20 tutorials as pre-conference events. In addition, consistent with previous editions, we feature a Demo Paper Track, Short Paper Track, PhD Symposium, Special Day, Resource Track, History of Web sessions, and Artifact Badging. Some of these are incorporated into the main conference schedule to encourage communication and collaboration among attendees.A commitment to diversity is pivotal to fostering robust, sustainable Web technologies. Our Web4Good track highlights how Web-based tools can address societal challenges, while the Industry Track showcases novel and impactful results from the industrial sector. This year, we have also launched an Emerging World Track to broaden participation from developing countries, as well as a competition track to enhance industry engagement..Organizing WWW'25 has been a true team effort. We sincerely thank the authors who contributed their work, and we extend our gratitude to the program and senior program committees for their dedication to reviewing submissions and offering feedback. We also appreciate the many additional chairs whose efforts ensured that each element of the program ran smoothly. Together, they have helped this conference continue to grow into a premier event for the Web research community.Finally, we would like to thank ACM SIGWEB and our industry sponsors-Meta, Huawei, Google, Baidu, Taobao, JD, and Infinigence-for their generous support, as well as our local government sponsors, Business Event Sydney and the NSW Government. We are equally grateful to our academic partner, the University of Technology Sydney, and the PCO company, ICMSA, for their indispensable help with registration, venue logistics, and social events. Their collective contributions have made the 2025 edition of this conference a resounding success.},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming ubiquitous to create intelligent virtual assistants that assist users in interacting with a system, as exemplified in marketing. Although LLMs have been discussed in Modeling &amp; Simulation (M&amp;S), the community has focused on generating code or explaining results. We examine the possibility of using LLMs to broaden access to simulations, by enabling non-simulation end-users to ask what-if questions in everyday language. Specifically, we discuss the opportunities and challenges in designing such an end-to-end system, divided into three broad phases. First, assuming the general case in which several simulation models are available, textual queries are mapped to the most relevant model. Second, if a mapping cannot be found, the query can be automatically reformulated and clarifying questions can be generated. Finally, simulation results are produced and contextualized for decision-making. Our vision for such system articulates long-term research opportunities spanning M&amp;S, LLMs, information retrieval, and ethics.},

While the complexity of automated tools and methods has evolved significantly (e.g., from basic parsers to the integration of advanced techniques), it remains challenging to pinpoint the field’s overall progress or compare methods. A first step towards a solution was the work ‘Automation for digital forensics: Towards a definition for the community’ which defines automation but cannot categorize various methods. This work aims to address this gap and presents a first classification model for automation for digital forensics. Therefore, we analyzed automation classification schemes from different disciplines (e.g., cars) and assessed various model possibilities as well as characteristics. We conclude that a 2-dimensional model with the axis ‘decision’ and ‘level of automation’ is most appropriate and provide an overview table with examples.},

We illustrate the different ways in which values define design problems and act as guiding principles for solutions. For instance, the value “accountability” functions as both a design problem (how to support journalists in accountability reporting) and as a guiding principle (features to ensure that systems remain accountable to users). Our analysis reveals how ten domain values shape design choices, and how these values can support or conflict with each other in practice. Building on these findings, we then discuss how designers might position their work in relation to stakeholders: journalists, the public, and technology providers. Each of these relationships presents unique value tensions for designers to consider and balance. In this way, our work provides practical guidance for creating systems that better serve newswork, helps designers reflect on how their choices impact different stakeholders, and contributes to critical computing discourses on where values require adjudication or deeper attention.},

abstract = {Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have generated discussions around and expectations for its impact in education. In a society where AI plays an increasing role, a basic understanding for the technology and its potential is considered crucial. Still, many educators feel apprehensive towards the use of AI in education, which naturally affects students’ opportunities to learn about and use AI-supported solutions. Users’ preference and trust in relation to these tools also becomes important when integrated in education. Bringing light on students’ perceptions of AI might help educators to better understand the value of such applications. The present study aims to provide insight into how university students perceive AI in general and, more particularly, the idea of having a machine performing tasks that have traditionally been handled by a teacher or a teaching assistant. The results are based on 140 Swedish and Taiwanese university students’ responses to an online questionnaire. Our results indicate that the students have quite positive perceptions of AI: they might still not feel very competent in AI, but show a large interest in the topic and are positive about its consequences for society. Nevertheless they also see potential drawbacks of the technology. As a whole, our findings indicate that Swedish and female students tend to prefer human interactions over AI-supported tools for learning.},

Yet, those who collect and annotate the data, and thus have the most intimate knowledge of its development, are often excluded from critical discussions. This exclusion prevents data annotators, who are domain experts, from contributing effectively to dataset contextualization. Our investigation into the hiring and engagement practices of 52 data work requesters on platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk reveals a gap: requesters frequently hold naive or unchallenged notions of worker identities and capabilities and rely on ad-hoc qualification tasks that fail to respect the workers' expertise. These practices not only undermine the quality of data but also the ethical standards of AI development. To rectify these issues, we advocate for policy changes to enhance how data annotation tasks are designed and managed and to ensure data workers are treated with the respect they deserve.},

abstract = {IP addresses with web services are crucial in the Internet ecosystem. Classifying these addresses by industry and organization offers valuable insights into the entities utilizing them, enabling more efficient network management and enhanced security. Previous work in website classification and Internet management struggles to offer an IP-level perspective of the industries of web services due to their limited industry categories or potential industry inconsistencies between IP address owners and AS owners. To this end, we present IPdb, an IP-level industry categorization dataset. To construct the dataset, we developed LLMIC, a Large Language Model-based Industry Categorization framework with a precision of nearly 96%. IPdb serves as a labeled database for future endeavors in developing IP-level industry classifiers, encompassing over 200 million IP addresses. Furthermore, our study indicates that 30% ~ 50% of organizations within critical infrastructure industries deploy web servers across multiple ASes. Our study also validates the problem of mismatched granularity in industry categorization at the AS level with 87.83% ASes in IPv4 and 72.96% ASes in IPv6 containing IP addresses from different industries.},

As lawmakers and regulators respond to these questions, the views of users can offer relevant perspectives. In this paper, we provide: (1) a survey of 574 developers on the licensing and copyright aspects of GenAI for coding, as well as follow-up interviews; (2) a snapshot of developers’ views at a time when GenAI and perceptions of it were rapidly evolving; and (3) an analysis of developers’ perspectives, yielding insights and recommendations that can inform future regulatory decisions in this evolving field. Our results show the benefits developers derive from GenAI, how they view the use of AI-generated code as similar to using other existing code, the varied opinions they have on who should own or be compensated for such code, that they are concerned about data leakage via GenAI, and other findings, providing organizations and policymakers with valuable insights into how the technology is being used and the concerns that stakeholders believe warrant attention.},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered remarkable advancements across diverse code-related tasks, known as Code LLMs, particularly in code generation that generates source code with LLM from natural language descriptions. This burgeoning field has captured significant interest from both academic researchers and industry professionals due to its practical significance in software development, e.g., GitHub Copilot. Despite the active exploration of LLMs for a variety of code tasks, either from the perspective of natural language processing (NLP) or software engineering (SE) or both, there is a noticeable absence of a comprehensive and up-to-date literature review dedicated to LLM for code generation. In this survey, we aim to bridge this gap by providing a systematic literature review that serves as a valuable reference for researchers investigating the cutting-edge progress in LLMs for code generation. We introduce a taxonomy to categorize and discuss the recent developments in LLMs for code generation, covering aspects such as data curation, latest advances, performance evaluation, ethical implications, environmental impact, and real-world applications. In addition, we present a historical overview of the evolution of LLMs for code generation and  provide a quantitative and qualitative comparative analysis of experimental results of code LLMs, sourced from their original papers to ensure a fair comparison on the HumanEval, MBPP, and BigCodeBench benchmarks, across various levels of difficulty and types of programming tasks, to highlight the progressive enhancements in LLM capabilities for code generation. We identify critical challenges and promising opportunities regarding the gap between academia and practical development. Furthermore, we have established a dedicated resource GitHub page () to continuously document and disseminate the most recent advances in the field.},

abstract = {People attempting to immigrate to the U.S. (through a port of entry or other means) may be required to accept various forms of surveillance technologies after interacting with immigration officials. In March 2025, around 160,000 people in the U.S. were required to use a smartphone application—BI SmartLINK—that uses facial recognition, voice recognition, and location tracking; others were assigned an ankle monitor or a smartwatch. These compulsory surveillance technologies exist under Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE)’s Alternatives to Detention (ATD) program, a combination of surveillance technologies, home visits, and in-person meetings with ICE officials and third-party “case specialists.” For migrants in the U.S. who are already facing multiple other challenges, such as securing housing, work, or healthcare, the surveillance technologies administered under ATD introduce new challenges.To understand the challenges facing migrants using&nbsp;BI SmartLINK under ATD, their questions about the app, and what role technologists might play (if any) in addressing these challenges, we conducted an interview study (n=9) with immigrant rights advocates. These advocates have collectively supported thousands of migrants over their careers and witnessed firsthand their struggles with surveillance tech under ATD. Among other things, our findings highlight how surveillance tech exacerbates the power imbalance between migrants and ICE officials (or their proxies), how these technologies (negatively) impact migrants, and how migrants and their advocates struggle to understand how the technologies that surveil them function. Our findings regarding the harms experienced by migrants lead us to believe that&nbsp;BI SmartLINK should not be used, and these harms fundamentally cannot be addressed by improvements to the app’s functionality or design. However, as this technology is currently deployed, we end by highlighting intervention opportunities for technologists to use our findings to make these high-stakes technologies less opaque for migrants and their advocates.},

With the advancement of pre-trained language models, Generative Information Retrieval (GenIR) emerges as a novel paradigm, attracting increasing attention. Based on the form of information provided to users, current research in GenIR can be categorized into two aspects: (1) Generative Retrieval (GR) leverages the generative model’s parameters for memorizing documents, enabling retrieval by directly generating relevant document identifiers without explicit indexing. (2) Reliable Response Generation employs language models to directly generate information users seek, breaking the limitations of traditional IR in terms of document granularity and relevance matching while offering flexibility, efficiency, and creativity to meet practical needs. This article aims to systematically review the latest research progress in GenIR. We will summarize the advancements in GR regarding model training and structure, document identifier, incremental learning, and so on, as well as progress in reliable response generation in aspects of internal knowledge memorization, external knowledge augmentation, and so on. We also review the evaluation, challenges, and future developments in GenIR systems. This review aims to offer a comprehensive reference for researchers, encouraging further development in the GenIR field (Github Repository: ).},

abstract = {In the era of big data, the development of mobile Internet and the popularity of mobile terminals have formed a huge amount of trajectory data of mobile objects, and the trajectory data contains rich spatial and temporal feature information, and through the trajectory data processing technology, it is possible to excavate the law of human activities and behavioral characteristics, the characteristics of the movement of urban vehicles, and the law of change of the atmospheric environment, and so on. Given the unique attributes of trajectory big data, especially the specificity of geographic information such as latitude and longitude, data processing is particularly important, which lays a solid foundation for subsequent in-depth data analysis and mining. This paper outlines the key techniques of data processing for trajectory big data. Firstly, it introduces the concept and characteristics of trajectory data, and data quality analysis; secondly, it describes the cleaning process of trajectory data and introduces three smoothing techniques; then, it realizes the matching between vehicle trajectory data and road network; finally, it looks forward and concludes the new methods of trajectory data processing in the era of big data.},

abstract = {Model-based testing (MBT) has been an important methodology in software engineering, attracting extensive research attention for over four decades. However, despite its academic acclaim, studies examining the impact of MBT in industrial environments—particularly regarding its extended effects—remain limited and yield unclear results. This gap may contribute to the challenges in establishing a study environment for implementing and applying MBT in production settings to evaluate its impact over time. To bridge this gap, we collaborated with an industrial partner to undertake a comprehensive, longitudinal empirical study employing mixed methods. Over two months, we implemented our MBT tool within the corporation, assessing the immediate and extended effectiveness and efficiency of MBT compared to script-writing-based testing. Through a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods—spanning controlled experiments, questionnaire surveys, and interviews—our study uncovers several insightful findings. These include differences in effectiveness and maintainability between immediate and extended MBT application, the evolving perceptions and expectations of engineers regarding MBT, and more. Leveraging these insights, we propose actionable implications for both the academic and industrial communities, aimed at bolstering confidence in MBT adoption and investment for software testing purposes.},

abstract = {This paper reports on the findings from a pilot program implementing the new interdisciplinary subject ''Digital World'' for fifth and sixth graders across 64 schools in the state of Hesse, Germany. The new subject combines computer science education with practical application skills and critical thinking skills regarding digital technologies. The project-based learning approaches in the subject promote the combination of digital phenomena with the sustainable development goals. The key topics of ''Digital World'' include 1) ''Computers Everywhere'', 2) ''Information &amp; Data'', 3) ''Basics of Programming'' and 4) ''Networks''. Following the interdisciplinary approach, students explore these key topics through three lenses: technological, user-oriented, and socio-cultural. This paper investigates a) how one year of teaching ''Digital World'' changes fifth grade students' self-efficacy regarding the four topics and the three different perspectives, as well as their subject interest; b) the relationship between the reported self-efficacy for the different aspects and the reported subject interest of the students. The results indicate a positive shift in self-efficacy for the key topics as well as for the perspectives while subject interest showed a downwards trend. There seem to be strong connection between the different aspects of the digital world as well as a moderate correlation to subject interest. These results strengthen the argument for interdisciplinary subjects, but leave room for motivating approaches towards teaching about the digital world.},

abstract = {With the increased popularity of the public transportation field, congestion in multi-line subway transfer hubs has become one of the hot issues. This study presents a comprehensive simulation model utilizing AnyLogic software to evaluate the performance of the 59th-Street-Columbus Circle subway transfer station in New York City by addressing challenges of inefficient passenger flow management. Leveraging the NYC turnstile usage data, the simulation focuses on this major three-level transfer hub to analyze passenger flows, identify bottlenecks, and evaluate potential solutions. Extensive simulation experiments reveal critical high-density regions prone to severe congestion, particularly at intersections. With an inverse relationship between crowd density and average passenger speed, higher densities lead to near-stagnant conditions during peak hours. By providing data-driven insights through simulation analyses, this research aims to enhance the commuter experience, reduce delays, ensure efficient behavior at vital transit hubs, and contribute to more-sustainable urban transportation by encouraging public transit usage.},

At one of the busiest UK airports, the subject of this study, the bottleneck is located in the passenger security hall, where staff are employed directly by the airport operator. This airport plans to restructure the current workforce's overall size and types of contracts. Our work proposes a Simheuristic approach that utilizes current workforce data and demand forecasts for the upcoming season to adjust the contractual configurations systematically. We employ simulation to test the expected costs (vs. flexibility needs) of the likely rosters that each contractual configuration will allow. Using the simulation results, the algorithm aims to identify the optimal contractual configuration to minimize costs while ensuring the adaptability required to address unforeseen changes in the flight schedule as each season is underway.},

Their work was supported by a substantial number of auxiliary reviewers. When composing the committee, we followed the tradition of AAMAS of not having anyone serve in a senior programme committee or area chair role for more than two years in a row, and we were pleased to see that many senior colleagues accepted our invitation to serve as regular programme committee members.For the main track, we received a total of 1361 abstract submissions. Some didn't materialize while a number of others were desk-rejected (mostly due to anonymity violations and similar infringements of the rules laid down in the Call for Papers). The program committee then reviewed the remaining 1021 submissions. Almost all submissions received at least three reviews, as well as a meta-review summarizing the assessment of the program committee. Authors had the opportunity to respond to initial versions of their reviews during a rebuttal phase, and the rebuttal phase additional gave the authors and reviewers an opportunity to engage in further discussion.},

While they have shown impressive performance in various multimodal tasks, the robustness of Visual Language Models (VLMs) has not been thoroughly investigated. We mainly focus on the robustness of VLMs on visual adversarial examples. In this work, we explore the capability of adversarial examples targeting VLMs. We highlight that the multimodal nature of VLMs presents a unique attack surface to manipulate the outputs of the LLMs, and the continuous nature of visual inputs further enhances the effectiveness of adversarial attacks against language generative models. Furthermore, we demonstrate three application scenarios for adversarial examples targeting VLMs: image description, jailbreaking, and information hiding. We conduct experiments on several leading open-source VLMs and demonstrate the successful application of adversarial examples in all the proposed scenarios. We hope that our findings would enable the development of multimodal models more robust to adversarial attacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/lafeat/m3-break.},

abstract = {Objectives Code style is an important aspect of text-based programming because programs written with good style are considered easier to understand and change and so improve the maintainability of the delivered software product. However teaching code style is complicated by the existence of many style guides and standards that contain inconsistent, low-level advice. The objective of the study is to support educators in helping students understand the nature of these inconsistencies by highlighting the rationale behind rules and their contextual nature.Participants Seventy members of local and national computing science education (CSE) groups contributed in the exploratory phase. Fifty-two members of the ACM SIGCSE members mailing list and the Australasian Chapter contributed in the evaluation and refinement phases. These mailing lists represent a large, global population of CSE educators.Study Methods We created, evaluated and refined an abstract code style model (CSM) comprising a Definition and eight Principles for code style. For CSM creation, we took an exploratory approach based on an examination of the existing literature on code quality and style. To evaluate the level of community endorsement for the model, we analysed quantitative and qualitative data from an international survey questionnaire. We refined the CSM based on an analysis of the qualitative survey data.Findings Analysis of the data from the survey indicated a strong level of support for the CSM. Quantitative data revealed a general agreement with the Principles, with responses for five Principles achieving a minimum of 84 percent agreement and all Principles achieving a minimum of 66 percent agreement. Qualitative data contained very few comments that voiced dissatisfaction with a basic aspect of the model. We found that barriers to developing a community-wide CSM were the strongly-held beliefs about style held by some and the abstract nature of the CSM.Conclusions The creation of an abstract set of Principles for code style is generally perceived by the community to be worthwhile and important and our approach has high levels of endorsement. A validated version of the CSM has been created.},

abstract = {Advances in quantum computing threaten classical cryptographic algorithms like RSA and ECC by enabling efficient problem-solving in polynomial time. In response, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has standardized post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms. While there have been some studies of integrating PQC into the TLS protocol for key establishment and signature generation, limited research exists on profiling these newly standardized algorithms in computational resource-constrained embedded systems for IoT usage. This work integrates NIST’s PQC algorithms into TLS servers and clients on embedded systems like Raspberry Pi with an Arm Cortex-A72 SoC. We benchmark PQC algorithms against classical ones, showing that the Kyber Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) outperforms ECDH by up to 2.55\texttimes{}. PQC signature algorithms (Dilithium, Falcon, and SPHINCS+) achieve 6.82\texttimes{}, 40.6%, and 9.3% of RSA’s signing performance and 27.5%, 1.46\texttimes{}, and 0.04% for verification, respectively. We also evaluate PQC-TLS on embedded SoCs, revealing handshake latency increases of ∼ 10–91% at Level 5 security. Furthermore, we are the first to evaluate the PQC-enabled QUIC protocol on an embedded system. We aim to optimize the performance overhead by leveraging QUIC’s quick connection establishment trait as a UDP-only protocol.keywords: Post-quantum Cryptography, Embedded System, QUIC, TLS protocol},

This model utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to process image data, such as changes in facial expressions; Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks process text or speech information to capture dynamic features of emotional fluctuations; Simultaneously combining other machine learning algorithms to process biomarker information such as heart rate variability. Through training and validation on a large-scale clinical dataset, the results show that the model can distinguish depressed patients from non-depressed individuals with high accuracy, providing new tools and technical support for early diagnosis of depression, improving the efficiency of mental health services, and promoting the development of personalized medical plans. In addition, this study also discusses the potential challenges and improvement directions that the model may face in future practical applications, including improving the level of data privacy protection and enhancing the model's generalization ability.},

abstract = {Cloud Computing environments are a fantastic foundation for unprecedented opportunities in the context of data management. Scalability and availability can be achieved by consequently disaggregating compute and storage and leveraging different data centers around the globe. Although conceptually infinitely available resources promise an easy game for database systems, leveraging those opportunities on the one side and providing enterprise-scale data management solutions for a wide range of extremely challenging business applications on the other side is by far not trivial. Within this paper we share the fundamental principles of SAP HANA Cloud---the data management backbone for all SAP applications---by providing insights into design criteria and technological centerpieces of SAP HANA Cloud as a result of a stringent evolutionary shift from a purely on-premise, in-memory database engine to an on-Cloud, memory-storage hierarchy-aware data management platform. We will motivate the transition and the decision of certain developments by sharing key characteristics of some key applications run by SAP, which require enterprise qualities like availability, cloud-capabilities like resource elasticity, while managing overall costs and the flexibility to adapt the underlying data management system to their specific needs. The overall goal of the paper is to provide insights into the ''story of SAP HANA Cloud'' by sharing challenges and lessons learned within the evolution towards a composable cloud-based data platform, thus strongly arguing for a ''one size fits all'' solution, if done right.},

abstract = {The technology of Digital Twin (DT) engineering is increasingly being leveraged in industry for a wide range of applications. More recently, many departments in the U.S. government are exploring the use of DT to support their respective mission mandates. The MITRE Corporation, as a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), is actively developing DT tools and capabilities to meet the needs of its government customers. While more people are becoming familiar with the term "Digital Twin," not everyone has a clear understanding of what it is, and how it is implemented in different applications. In this paper, we present some of these DT tools and capabilities, as well as some MITRE projects that have benefitted from the DT toolset. Additionally, we discuss several nascent areas where DT may bring greater value to MITRE customers.},

Since 2014, we have hosted, on our university campus, an annual two-week enrichment program that employs design thinking, leadership training, entrepreneurship, robotics, engineering and the creative arts, to inspire high school students to become innovative problem-solvers. The hands-on robotics and engineering modules are key parts of the program, used to enhance students' interest in computer science and engineering, and their awareness of related careers. The goal is to expand the pool of promising young people from the developing world who can join the ranks of creators of technological solutions. The highlight of the experience is when participants work in teams to create solutions to a challenge related to a real-world and contextually relevant scenario. The achievements of these students during the short period of the enrichment program, and anecdotal reports on the long-term impact of this program, show great promise of what can be achieved with the right conditions.},

The case study is a conceptual 4.5 MWth Small Modular Lead-cooled Fast (LFR) Research Reactor whose design incorporated aspects from all the three existing families of Gen IV LFRs. The back end for the DT exploited a modular approach consisting of the Neutronics and Thermohydraulic Coupling of the reactor core. This modular approach gives room for subsequent modification and/or addition of new blocks as the design concept matures without perturbing the entire system. After benchmarking simulation results with data from literature, the system's GUI demonstrated the capability to perform and visualize common operational transients either as a stand-alone simulator or in real-time using the MQTT broker. Insights derived from this virtual environment could contribute towards the ongoing refinement of LFR technology thus accelerating development through design testing, visualization, and optimization.},

abstract = {Successful software development hinges on effective communication and collaboration, which are significantly influenced by human and social dynamics. Poor management of these elements can lead to the emergence of ‘community smells’, i.e., negative patterns in socio-technical interactions that gradually accumulate as ‘social debt’. This issue is particularly pertinent in machine learning-enabled systems, where diverse actors such as data engineers and software engineers interact at various levels. The unique collaboration context of these systems presents an ideal setting to investigate community smells and their impact on development communities. This article addresses a gap in the literature by identifying the types, causes, effects, and potential mitigation strategies of community smells in machine learning-enabled systems. Using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), we developed hypotheses based on existing literature and interviews, and conducted a questionnaire-based study to collect data. Our analysis resulted in the construction and validation of five models that represent the causes, effects, and strategies for five specific community smells. These models can help practitioners identify and address community smells within their organizations, while also providing valuable insights for future research on the socio-technical aspects of machine learning-enabled system communities.},

Abandoned (or unmaintained), buggy, and hard to use software, a perception often associated with scientific software can hinder scientific progress, yet, in contrast to other types of software, its longevity is poorly understood. Existing data curation efforts are fragmented by science domain and/or are small in scale and lack key attributes. We use large language models to classify public software repositories in World of Code into distinct scientific domains and layers of the software stack, curating a large and diverse collection of over 18,000 scientific software projects. Using this data, we estimate survival models to understand how the domain, infrastructural layer, and other attributes of scientific software affect its longevity. We further obtain a matched sample of non-scientific software repositories and investigate the differences. We find that infrastructural layers, downstream dependencies, mentions of publications, and participants from government are associated with a longer lifespan, while newer projects with participants from academia had shorter lifespan. Against common expectations, scientific projects have a longer lifetime than matched non-scientific open-source software projects. We expect our curated attribute-rich collection to support future research on scientific software and provide insights that may help extend longevity of both scientific and other projects.},

Event-driven architecture (EDA) benefits applications targeting distributed research infrastructures by enabling the organization, communication, processing, reliability, and security of events generated from many sources. To support the development of scientific EDA, we introduce Octopus, a hybrid, cloud-to-edge event fabric designed to link many local event producers and consumers with cloud-hosted brokers, and to provide a fabric for developing resilient applications. Octopus can be scaled to meet demand, permits the deployment of highly available Triggers for automatic event processing, and enforces fine-grained access control. We identify requirements in self-driving laboratories, scientific data automation, online task scheduling, epidemic modeling, and dynamic workflow management use cases, and present results demonstrating Octopus' ability to meet those requirements. Octopus supports producing and consuming events at a rate of over 4.2 M and 9.6 M events per second, respectively, from distributed clients.},

abstract = {Discrete-event simulation (DES) models for healthcare service planning are time-consuming to develop for both modellers and healthcare stakeholders. Model reuse is seen as a potential solution to reduce duplication of effort and maximise the potential value gained from the model. One approach to model reuse is to deploy a simulation model for the same purpose in a single application area, which can be used for planning by healthcare staff such as managers, clinicians or analysts. A model deployed for reuse by healthcare stakeholders needs to be shared and accessible. However, Python can present accessibility and usability challenges for non-technical users. In this paper we investigate some of the advantages and disadvantages to several methods of deploying interactive DES models to non-technical healthcare users. Combining DES with methods and tools from computer science and software engineering, these hybrid models aim to increase the usability, functionality, and accessibility of simulation models.},

abstract = {Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) is a well-established practice that automatically builds, tests, packages, and deploys software systems. To adopt CI/CD, software developers need to configure their projects using dedicated YML configuration files. Mobile apps have distinct characteristics with respect to CI/CD practices, such as testing on various emulators and deploying to app stores. However, little is known about the challenges and added value of adopting CI/CD in mobile apps and how developers maintain such a practice. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on CI/CD practices in  (2,557)  Android apps adopting four popular CI/CD services, namely GitHub&nbsp;Actions, Travis&nbsp;CI, CircleCI, and GitLab&nbsp;CI/CD. We also compare our findings with those reported in prior research on general CI/CD practices to situate them within broader trends. We observe a lack of commonality and standardization across CI/CD services and Android apps, leading to complex YML configurations and associated maintenance efforts. We also observe that CI/CD configurations focus primarily on the build setup, with around half of the projects performing standard testing and only  (9%)  incorporating deployment. In addition, we find that CI/CD configurations are changed bi-monthly on average, with frequent maintenance correlating with active issue tracking, project size/age, and community engagement. Our qualitative analysis of commits uncovered  (11)  themes in CI/CD maintenance activities, with over a third of the changes focusing on improving workflows and fixing build issues, whereas another third involves updating the build environment, tools, and dependencies. Our study emphasizes the necessity for automation and AI-powered tools to improve CI/CD processes for mobile apps and advocates creating adaptable open-source tools to efficiently manage resources, especially in testing and deployment.},

abstract = {In daily life and industrial production environments, frequent electric shock accidents can seriously threaten people's lives. Traditional anti-electric shock measures often rely on physical isolation and manual supervision, which has great limitations in real-time and accuracy. In order to reduce the risk of electric shock, this paper designs and implements an electric shock warning system based on computer algorithms. The system adopts a modular architecture and integrates algorithms such as convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) network and support vector machine (SVM), mainly including data acquisition module, data processing module, feature extraction module, model prediction module and warning response module. The data acquisition module integrates millimeter wave radar and other modules to monitor key parameters such as current and voltage in real-time. The data processing module is responsible for signal preprocessing, including normalization, filtering and denoising. The feature extraction module uses CNN to identify key features related to the risk of electric shock. The model prediction module combines LSTM and SVM to analyze the extracted features and predict the risk of electric shock. The early warning response module triggers the early warning mechanism when a risk is detected, sends early warning information to relevant personnel through sound and light alarms, SMS (short message service) notifications, etc., and links with the automatic power-off device. The final result analysis shows that the average early warning accuracy of the anti-electric shock early warning system in 20 simulated electric shock scenarios is as high as 97.715%, and the maximum warning time is 292 milliseconds, which is significantly better than the traditional early warning system, improving the accuracy and response speed of the early warning.},

abstract = {A linear economy (LE)-based take-make-use-waste model is environmentally unsustainable and other care settings for medical devices. A significant proportion of UK's National Health Service (NHS) emissions is derived from medical devices. The alternative, a circular economy (CE) system, has the potential to mitigate the environmental impacts associated with LE. This paper evaluates the effect of introducing CE in the healthcare supply chain in the context of small medical devices (SMDs). We develop simulation models that quantify the environmental, operational, and financial impact of circular interventions in the value chain of SMDs. Two complementary simulation models that evaluate the impact of CE for a surgical instrument, laparoscopic scissors, as an example, representing the whole-system perspective and cost-effectiveness from the hospital setting perspective, are presented. Our preliminary findings suggest that the introduction of CE leads to reduced overall environmental emissions, and to improved cost-effectiveness from a hospital setting perspective.},

abstract = {Many recent papers have contributed novel concurrency control and transaction processing algorithms that start by making an assumption about the transaction workload submitted by an application, and yield high performance (sometimes by an order of magnitude) under these assumptions. Two of the most common assumptions are (1) Is the read and write set of a transaction known (or easily derivable) directly by analyzing the application code in advance of transaction execution, or is the access set of a transaction dependent on the current state of the database? (2) Does the application send the entire transaction in a single request to the database system or is the transaction sent via several requests ''interactively'', with application code run in between these requests. The database community has made tremendous progress in improving throughput and latency of transaction processing when read/write sets are known in advance, and for non-interactive transactions. However, the impact of this progress is directly dependent on the accuracy of these assumptions both for current and future applications. In this paper, we conduct an extensive study of 111 open-source applications, analyzing over 30,000 transactions to evaluate the accuracy of these assumptions both as they exist in the current codebase, and how extensive are the changes required to the code for these assumptions to hold moving forward. Our study reveals that the second of these assumptions is stronger than the first. More specifically, for 90% of applications, at least 58% of transactions per application have read/write sets that can be inferred in advance. Furthermore, although only 39% of applications contain zero interactive transactions, nonetheless, the majority of the remaining 61% of applications can be converted to being completely non-interactive with minimal changes.These insights underscore the potential for further optimization and research in designing OLTP systems that balance transaction expressivity and performance.},

abstract = {Aim. The code review team at Meta is continuously improving the code review process. In this work, we report on three randomized controlled experimental trials to improve code reviewer recommendation.Method. To evaluate the recommenders, we conduct three A/B tests which are a type of randomized controlled experimental trial. The unit is either the code diff (Meta’s term for a pull-request) or all the diffs that an author creates during the experimental period. We set goal metrics, i.e. those we expect to improve, and guardrail metrics, those that we do not want to negatively impact, i.e. analogous to safety metrics in medical trials. We test the outcomes using a t-test, Wilcoxon test, or Fisher test depending on the type of data.Expt 1. We developed a new recommender, RevRecV2, based on features that had been successfully used in the literature and that could be calculated with low latency. In an A/B test on 82k diffs in Spring of 2022, we found that the new recommender was more accurate and had lower latency. The new recommender did not impact the amount of time a diff was under review. The results allowed us to roll-out the recommender in Summer of 2022 to all of Meta.Expt 2. Reviewer workload is not evenly distributed, our goal was to reduce the workload of top reviewers. Based on the literature, and using historical data, we conducted backtests to determine the best measure of reviewer workload. We then ran an A/B test on 28k diff authors in Winter 2023 on a workload balanced recommender, RevRecWL. Our A/B test led to mixed results. When a low workload reviewer had reasonable expertise, authors selected them, however, the top recommended low workload reviewer was often not selected. There was no impact on our guardrail metrics of the amount of time to perform a review. This workload balancing replaced the recommender from the first experiment as the recommender in production at Meta.Expt 3. Engineers at Meta often select a team rather than an individual reviewer to review a diff. We suspected the bystander effect might be slowing down reviews of these diffs because no single individual was assigned the review. On diffs that only had a team assigned, we randomly selected one of the top three recommended reviewers to review the diff with BystanderRecRnd. We conducted an A/B test on 12.5k authors in Spring 2023 and found a large decrease in the amount of time it took for diffs to be reviewed. We did not find that reviewers rushed reviews. The results were strong enough to roll this recommender out to all diffs that only have a team assigned for review.Implications. Aside from the direct findings from our work, our findings suggest there can be a discrepancy between historical back-testing and A/B test experimental findings, and that more A/B tests are necessary to test recommenders in production. Outcome measures beyond accuracy are important. This is especially true in understanding how recommenders change a reviewer’s workload. We also see that the latency in displaying a recommendation can have a large impact on how often authors select recommendations making the reporting of latency an important metric for future work.},

abstract = {Microservice-based systems (MSS) may fail with various fault types, due to their complex and dynamic nature. While existing AIOps methods excel at detecting abnormal traces and locating the responsible service(s), human efforts from practitioners are still required for further root cause analysis to diagnose specific fault types and analyze failure reasons for detected abnormal traces, particularly when abnormal traces do not stem directly from specific services. In this paper, we propose a novel AIOps framework, TraFaultDia, to automatically classify abnormal traces into fault categories for MSS. We treat the classification process as a series of multi-class classification tasks, where each task represents an attempt to classify abnormal traces into specific fault categories for a MSS. TraFaultDia is trained on several abnormal trace classification tasks with a few labeled instances from a MSS using a meta-learning approach. After training, TraFaultDia can quickly adapt to new, unseen abnormal trace classification tasks with a few labeled instances across MSS. TraFaultDia’s use cases are scalable depending on how fault categories are built from anomalies within MSS. We evaluated TraFaultDia on two representative MSS, TrainTicket and OnlineBoutique, with open datasets. In these datasets, each fault category is tied to the faulty system component(s) (service/pod) with a root cause. Our TraFaultDia automatically classifies abnormal traces into these fault categories, thus enabling the automatic identification of faulty system components and root causes without manual analysis. Our results show that, within the MSS it is trained on, TraFaultDia achieves an average accuracy of 93.26% and 85.20% across 50 new, unseen abnormal trace classification tasks for TrainTicket and OnlineBoutique respectively, when provided with 10 labeled instances for each fault category per task in each system. In the cross-system context, when TraFaultDia is applied to a MSS different from the one it is trained on, TraFaultDia gets an average accuracy of 92.19% and 84.77% for the same set of 50 new, unseen abnormal trace classification tasks of the respective systems, also with 10 labeled instances provided for each fault category per task in each system.},

Many Black women who start a computer science (CS) program often face barriers prompting them to reconsider and ultimately change majors. Recent work centered on the intersectional experiences of Black Women identify the nuances of what is needed to aid in the persistence of Black women. For example, career awareness and faculty mentorship are found to be especially important to Black women's computing persistence. Other studies have highlighted the importance of peer mentoring and a sense of belonging. In this study, we report on a research-based, targeted intervention for Black women in computing that aims to increase their persistence in the field. This intervention is aimed at first-year, traditional freshmen who are Black Women majoring in CS at a research university. The RISE Stars program consists of four main components designed to build and sustain a supportive community among the students: peer-based mentoring, a group-based social impact project, monthly cohort meetings, and social media platforms. This experience report describes the first year of organizing this program, shares initial promising outcomes, and describes lessons learned that can serve as a model to others to replicate.},

To address these challenges, a simulation model library for construction is being established. The Plant Simulation System is used to map construction site systems with various model components, enabling digital simulation of the environment and supply chains. Customized simulation parameters are used to simulate specific construction requirements. This paper describes the use of masonry robots and transportation in wall and floor construction and their impact on site performance. The simulation model library REMUS is important for digitalizing construction sites, allowing for the assessment of innovative systems before construction and estimation of investment returns.

abstract = {In these proceedings, we present papers from the Working Groups that worked in the context of the 29th Annual Conference on Innovation &amp; Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE), held in Milan Italy, and hosted by Universit\`{a} degli Studi di Milano from the 8th to the 10th of July 2024.The concept of Working Groups has been a unique feature of the ITiCSE conference series since its inception. Working Groups are now part of CompEd and SIGCSE Virtual. An ITiCSE Working Group is typically composed of 8-12 researchers who work together for about nine months on a research project related to computing education. Working Groups provide a wonderful opportunity to work intensively on a topic of interest with an international group of computing education researchers. This unique experience is one that, in our opinion, each Computer Science Educator should strive to participate in at least once.In 2024, 13 proposals for Working Groups were received and ten Working Groups were selected by the Working Group chairs to recruit members and proceed for ITiCSE 2024. There were 166 member applications to Working Groups, with 134 being accepted including 33 Working Group leaders across the ten Working Groups. This is a record number of both Working Groups and Working Group members at a single conference.Working Groups began their work virtually from March up until the beginning of the ITiCSE conference. Their work included intensive collaboration on-site for the three days prior to the conference. A draft report was then submitted on the Sunday prior to the conference; a few weeks after the conference, the Working Groups submitted their final report for peer review.If the report was accepted for publication, the groups revised it based on the reviewers' comments and suggestions. This dedicated ITiCSE Working Group proceedings volume presents the final camera-ready version of the reports. We are glad that all ten papers were selected for publication in these proceedings for the ACM Digital Library.},

title = {Do Responsible AI Artifacts Advance Stakeholder Goals? Four Key Barriers Perceived by Legal and Civil Stakeholders},
year = {2025},
publisher = {AAAI Press},
abstract = {The responsible AI (RAI) community has introduced numerous processes and artifacts---such as Model Cards, Transparency Notes, and Data Cards---to facilitate transparency and support the governance of AI systems. While originally designed to scaffold and document AI development processes in technology companies, these artifacts are becoming central components of regulatory compliance under recent regulations such as the EU AI Act. Much of the existing literature has focussed on the design of new RAI artifacts or their use by practitioners within technology companies. However, as RAI artifacts begin to play key roles in enabling external oversight, it becomes critical to understand how stakeholders---particularly stakeholders situated outside of technology companies who govern and audit industry AI deployments---perceive the efficacy of RAI artifacts. In this study, we conduct semi-structured interviews and design activities with 19 government, legal, and civil society stakeholders who inform policy and advocacy around responsible AI efforts. While participants believe that RAI artifacts are a valuable contribution to the broader AI governance ecosystem, many have concerns around their potential unintended and longer-term impacts on actors outside of technology companies (e.g., downstream end-users, policymakers, civil society stakeholders). We organized these beliefs into four barriers that help explain how RAI artifacts may (inadvertently) reconfigure power relations across civil society, government, and industry, impeding civil society and legal stakeholders' ability to protect downstream end-users from potential AI harms. Participants envision how structural changes, along with changes in how RAI artifacts are designed, used, and governed, could help re-direct the role of artifacts to support more collaborative and proactive external oversight of AI systems. We discuss research and policy implications for RAI artifacts.},

abstract = {This paper presents an integrated approach to enhancing situational awareness and decision-making in dynamic environments by combining optical-flow-based Markov Decision Processes (MDP) with physics-based simulations for proactive surveillance system design. By utilizing optical flow for real-time motion detection and analysis, our framework achieves immediate comprehension of environmental changes, which is essential for autonomous navigation and surveillance applications. Additionally, the framework employs MDP to model and resolve decision-making problems where outcomes are partly random and partly controlled by the decision-maker, optimizing actions based on predicted future states. The model was validated through Hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations, providing a detailed understanding of the physical phenomena influencing the system. This ensures that decisions are data-driven and customized to specific situations and missions. Our approach offers a comprehensive understanding of system integration with AI, along with real-time analysis and decision-making capabilities, thereby advancing the simulation modeling methodology for engaging with complex, dynamic environments.},

In order to benefit from the experience of the automotive industry, traffic accident research and V&amp;V methods in this field have been analyzed. In this paper, the effects of traffic separation in maritime traffic are analyzed on the basis of traffic separation in road traffic. Examples of the typical behavior of seagoing vessels are presented based on the analysis and evaluation of historical data collected worldwide in the context of maritime traffic separation. In order to effectively and sustainably use traffic separation systems for V&amp;V, the open test space of the world's oceans is clustered using a methodical approach. This results in a test track for automated driving ships, which is integrated into the simulation and used for V&amp;V through implemented scenarios.},

year = {2025},
isbn = {9798331534202},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Transportation agencies are increasingly adopting cutting-edge solutions to enhance infrastructure management strategies. Infrastructure condition prediction models, particularly important for optimizing inspection resources, are at the forefront of this trend. Machine learning (ML) algorithms play a crucial role in these models, but traditional centralized ML models often struggle with data scarcity, privacy, and transferability. This paper introduces a decentralized approach using Federated Learning (FL) for infrastructure condition prediction, simulating its effectiveness with culvert inventories in Utah and five other states in the United States. We analyzed two FL models---one with data augmentation and one without---against a traditional centralized model. Our results demonstrated that FL-based models improved prediction accuracy by 30%, ensured data privacy, and reduced data transmission overheads. Moreover, due to its limited data, Utah benefited from federated insights, illustrating FL's potential to effectively enhance infrastructure management. The simulation highlights the advantages of utilizing FL in real-world scenarios.},

abstract = {Software logs serve as valuable resources for understanding system running and are extensively used in diverse software maintenance tasks. Logs are generated by logging statements in the code, which are written by developers. Therefore, logs may reflect developers’ sentiments about the described situations. Consequently, when developers and system administrators read logs, the sentiments embedded in logs may influence their understanding. Although the sentiments associated with logs can convey valuable information, such information is not leveraged in research and practice. Previous research has primarily relied on verbosity levels of logs to gauge sentiments, which does not really capture the sentiments and emotions perceived by humans.To bridge this gap, in this paper, we first conduct an exploratory study to investigate sentiments and emotions that are communicated within logs. Our study encompasses five anomaly log datasets from LogHub and a dataset involving eight open-source Apache Java projects. We find that 8% of the logs express sentiments and emotions though developers are suggested to write them in an objective way. While most log messages might not explicitly express sentiments and emotions, they can still implicitly evoke sentiments and emotions in those who read them. Therefore, we exploit issue reports referencing logs to capture such sentiments and emotions. In these issue reports, 47.5% exhibit emotions, with 54.7% of those emotions being related to logs and 8.1% directly addressing logs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of leveraging sentiment analysis to complement verbosity levels in logs, showcasing how sentiment information can offer novel insights and enhance log analysis. Specifically, by applying automatic tools, we identify 41 issue reports (9.8% on average) with negative sentiment and 55 reports (13.2% on average) with negative emotions, all referencing INFO or DEBUG logs (i.e., low severity). After manually verifying and filtering exception logs, we uncover three main concerns from 22 critical instances.},

abstract = {Debugging consists in understanding the behavior of a program to identify and correct its defects.                Breakpoints are the most commonly used debugging tool and aim to facilitate the debugging process by allowing developers to interrupt a program’s execution at a source code location of their choice and inspect the state of the program.                                Researchers suggest that in systems developed using object-oriented programming (OOP), traditional breakpoints may be a not effective method for debugging. In OOP, developers create code in classes, which at runtime are instantiated as object—entities with their own state and behavior that can interact with one another. Traditional breakpoints are set within the class code, halting execution for every object that shares that class’s code. This leads to unnecessary interruptions for developers who are focused on monitoring the behavior of a specific object.                                As an answer to this challenge, researchers proposed object-centric debugging, an approach based on debugging tools that focus on objects rather than classes.                In particular, using object-centric breakpoints, developers can select specific objects (rather than classes) for which the execution must be interrupted.                Even though it seems reasonable that this approach may ease the debugging process by reducing the time and actions needed for debugging objects, no research has yet verified its actual impact.     To investigate the impact of object-centric breakpoints on the debugging process, we devised and conducted a controlled experiment with 81 developers who spent an average of 1 hour and 30 minutes each on the study.                The experiment required participants to complete two debugging tasks using debugging tools with vs. without object-centric breakpoints.                 We found no significant effect from the use of object-centric breakpoints on the number of actions required to debug or the effectiveness in understanding or fixing the bug. However, for one of the two tasks, we measured a statistically significant reduction in debugging time for participants who used object-centric breakpoints, while for the other task, there was a statistically significant increase. Our analysis suggests that the impact of object-centric breakpoints varies depending on the context and the specific nature of the bug being addressed. In particular, our analysis indicates that object-centric breakpoints can speed up the process of locating the root cause of a bug when the bug can be replicated without needing to restart the program. We discuss the implications of these findings for debugging practices and future research.},

There is potential for the motion tracking capabilities of consumer immersive Virtual Reality (VR) technologies to occupy the ‘space’ between survey-based screening and formal motor assessment used to diagnose this population. Here, we describe the process for the initial alpha development of motor assessment tasks in VR based on established tasks from literature, and our engagement with dyspraxic adults and children to co-develop a tool which could lay the foundation for a more accessible, objective, and engaging alternative to traditional diagnostic and screening tools.},

However, the field of data systems encompasses a large number of topics ranging from data manipulation and database distribution to creating data pipelines and data analytics solutions. Due to the slow nature of curriculum development, it remains unclear (i) which data systems topics are recommended across diverse higher education curriculum guidelines, (ii) which topics are taught in higher education data systems courses, and (iii) which data systems topics are actually valued in data-focused industry roles. In this study, we analyzed computing curriculum guidelines, course contents, and industry needs regarding data systems to uncover discrepancies between them. Our results show, for example, that topics such as data visualization, data warehousing, and semi-structured data models are valued in industry, yet seldom taught in courses. This work allows professionals to further align curriculum guidelines, higher education, and data systems industry to better prepare students for their working life by focusing on relevant skills in data systems education.},

Despite the proven effectiveness of simulation in project planning and control, its adoption is hindered by complexity and limited reusability. High-Level Architecture (HLA) standards were explored to mitigate these challenges, yet they also pose complexities of their own. The proposed framework integrates simulation and HLA advantages within a single environment, offering a standard object model for mapping data, a decomposable simulation component that supports plug-and-play flexibility, and a data acquisition and integration component that supports real-time dynamic updates and scenario analysis. A prototype federation demonstrates initial functionality, showcasing the framework's potential to streamline construction processes and enhance decision-making. By leveraging simulation and HLA synergies, our framework represents a promising approach to achieving integrated construction planning and control throughout project lifecycles.},

In this paper, we argue that GenAI fairness research still has not met these challenges; instead, a significant gap remains between existing bias assessment methods and regulatory goals. This leads to ineffective regulation that can allow deployment of reportedly fair, yet actually discriminatory, GenAI systems. Towards remedying this problem, we connect the legal and technical literature around GenAI bias evaluation and identify areas of misalignment. Through four case studies, we demonstrate how this misalignment between fairness testing techniques and regulatory goals can result in discriminatory outcomes in real-world deployments, especially in adaptive or complex environments. We offer practical recommendations for improving discrimination testing to better align with regulatory goals and enhance the reliability of fairness assessments in future deployments.},

In this work we describe our process of participatory action research with drivers and trade union organisers, culminating in a participatory audit of Uber’s algorithmic pay and work allocation, before and after the introduction of dynamic pricing. Through longitudinal analysis of 1.5 million trips from 258 drivers in the UK, we find that after dynamic pricing, pay has decreased, Uber’s cut has increased, job allocation and pay is less predictable, inequality between drivers is increased, and drivers spend more time waiting for jobs. In addition to these findings, we provide methodological and theoretical contributions to algorithm auditing, gig work, and the emerging practice of worker data science.},

abstract = {Generative AI (GenAI) is advancing rapidly, and the literature in computing education is expanding almost as quickly. Initial responses to GenAI tools were mixed between panic and utopian optimism. Many were fast to point out the opportunities and challenges of GenAI. Researchers reported that these new tools are capable of solving most introductory programming tasks and are causing disruptions throughout the curriculum. These tools can write and explain code, enhance error messages, create resources for instructors, and even provide feedback and help for students like a traditional teaching assistant. In 2024, new research started to emerge on the effects of GenAI usage in the computing classroom. These new data involve the use of GenAI to support classroom instruction at scale and to teach students how to code with GenAI. In support of the former, a new class of tools is emerging that can provide personalized feedback to students on their programming assignments or teach both programming and prompting skills at the same time. With the literature expanding so rapidly, this report aims to summarize and explain what is happening on the ground in computing classrooms. We provide a systematic literature review; a survey of educators and industry professionals; and interviews with educators using GenAI in their courses, educators studying GenAI, and researchers who create GenAI tools to support computing education. The triangulation of these methods and data sources expands the understanding of GenAI usage and perceptions at this critical moment for our community.},

abstract = {Continued contributions of core developers in open source software (OSS) projects are key for sustaining and maintaining successful OSS projects.   A major risk to the sustainability of OSS projects is developer turnover.   Prior studies have explored developer turnover at the level of individual projects.  A shortcoming of such studies is that they ignore the impact of developer turnover on downstream projects.   Yet, an awareness of the turnover of core developers offers useful insights to the rest of an open source ecosystem.   This study performs a large-scale empirical analysis of code developer turnover in the Rust package ecosystem. We find that the turnover of core developers is quite common in the whole Rust ecosystem with 36,991 packages. This is particularly worrying as a vast majority of Rust packages only have a single core developer.   We found that core developer turnover can significantly decrease the quality and efficiency of software development and maintenance, even leading to deprecation.   This is a major source of concern for those Rust packages that are widely used.   We surveyed developers' perspectives on the turnover of core developers in upstream packages.   We found that developers widely agreed that core developer turnover can affect project stability and sustainability. They also emphasized the importance of transparency and timely notifications regarding the health status of upstream dependencies.   This study provides unique insights to help communities focus on building reliable software dependency networks.},

abstract = {Testing web forms is an essential activity for ensuring the quality of web applications. It typically involves evaluating the interactions between users and forms. Automated test-case generation remains a challenge for web-form testing: Due to the complex, multi-level structure of web pages, it can be difficult to automatically capture their inherent contextual information for inclusion in the tests. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential for contextual text generation. This motivated us to explore how they could generate automated tests for web forms, making use of the contextual information within form elements. To the best of our knowledge, no comparative study examining different LLMs has yet been reported for web-form-test generation. To address this gap in the literature, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study investigating the effectiveness of 11 LLMs on 146 web forms from 30 open-source Java web applications. In addition, we propose three HTML-structure-pruning methods to extract key contextual information. The experimental results show that different LLMs can achieve different testing effectiveness, with the GPT-4, GLM-4, and Baichuan2 LLMs generating the best web-form tests. Compared with GPT-4, the other LLMs had difficulty generating appropriate tests for the web forms: Their successfully-submitted rates (SSRs) — the proportions of the LLMs-generated web-form tests that could be successfully inserted into the web forms and submitted — decreased by 9.10% to 74.15%. Our findings also show that, for all LLMs, when the designed prompts include complete and clear contextual information about the web forms, more effective web-form tests were generated. Specifically, when using Parser-Processed HTML for Task Prompt (PH-P), the SSR averaged 70.63%, higher than the 60.21% for Raw HTML for Task Prompt (RH-P) and 50.27% for LLM-Processed HTML for Task Prompt (LH-P). With RH-P, GPT-4’s SSR was 98.86%, outperforming models like LLaMa2 (7B) with 34.47% and GLM-4V with 0%. Similarly, with PH-P, GPT-4 reached an SSR of 99.54%, the highest among all models and prompt types. Finally, this paper also highlights strategies for selecting LLMs based on performance metrics, and for optimizing the prompt design to improve the quality of the web-form tests.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of designing an early stopping clinical trial investigating the efficacy of a medical intervention against the available standard of care. The standard approach is to determine a stopping rule minimizing the expected number of patients required, subject to error rate constraints, not considering costs explicitly depending on the magnitude of the treatment effect. In this paper we formulate an optimal stopping problem for clinical trials with instantaneous continuous response, the objective being minimizing an overall risk comprising loss functions accounting for costs involving the treatment effect that might model ethical and economic costs. To solve the optimization problem we propose a feasible directions simulation-based algorithm requiring new stochastic gradient estimators which we derive using Smoothed Perturbation Analysis. We conduct simulation experiments to test the effectiveness of the simulation optimization algorithm and to obtain insights on the effects of the various risk factors on the optimal solution.},

abstract = {Computing graduates are frequently reported by members of industry to lack in professional dispositions and/or non-technical skills (often referred to as "soft skills"). In this work, we conduct a gap analysis of the alignment between academic preparation and industry expectations through a three-pronged study. First, a literature review explored the academic perspective of how fostering professional dispositions and non-technical skills occurs in tertiary computing education. Second, a literature review identifying industry's expectations of those dispositions and skills for entry-level computing professionals. Finally, a mixed-methods approach, combining a survey and structured interviews of computing industry professionals to identify their opinions on the relative importance of those skills and dispositions. In each of these prongs, we additionally consider whether and how Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (DEIA) may have been approached and/or incorporated.Our work uncovers a number of gaps. Several skills and dispositions, such as leadership, ethics, and inventiveness, are over-represented in the academic literature compared to industry's expectations, while others such as lifelong learning and professionalism are under-emphasised. Furthermore, some terms such as 'ethics' and 'professionalism' are defined differently by various stakeholder groups, leading to a gap between academic training and industry expectations. Finally, several skills and dispositions, such as collaboration, teamwork, communication, and leadership show evidence of exposure in academia, but require more scaffolded instruction to meet industry expectations. We also found a dearth of coverage in the literature and a lack of focus in industry for DEIA considerations.},

It provides reviewers with the opportunity to identify potential bugs, offer constructive feedback, and suggest improvements. Clear and concise code review comments (CRCs) facilitate the communication between developers and are crucial to the correct understanding of the identified issues and proposed solutions. Despite the importance of CRCs’ clarity, there is still a lack of guidelines on what constitutes a good clarity and how to evaluate it. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on understanding and evaluating the clarity of CRCs. We first derive a set of attributes related to the clarity of CRCs, namely RIE attributes (i.e., Relevance, Informativeness, and Expression), as well as their corresponding evaluation criteria based on our literature review and survey with practitioners. We then investigate the clarity of CRCs in open-source projects written in nine programming languages and find that a large portion (i.e., 28.8%) of the CRCs lack the clarity in at least one of the attributes. Finally, we explore the potential of automatically evaluating the clarity of CRCs by proposing ClearCRC. Experimental results show that ClearCRC with pre-trained language models is promising for effective evaluation of the clarity of CRCs, achieving a balanced accuracy up to 73.04% and a F-1 score up to 94.61%.},

abstract = {Algorithmic systems are increasingly being adopted by cultural heritage institutions like libraries. In this study, we investigate U.S. public libraries’ adoption of one specific automated tool—automated collection diversity audits—which we see as an illuminating case study for broader trends. Typically developed and sold by commercial book distributors, automated diversity audits aim to evaluate how well library collections reflect demographic and thematic diversity. We investigate how these audits function, whether library workers find them useful, and what is at stake when sensitive, normative decisions about representation are outsourced to automated systems designed by private vendors. Our analysis draws on an anonymous survey of U.S. public librarians (n = 99), interviews with 14 librarians, a sample of purchasing records, and vendor documentation. We find that many library workers view these tools as convenient, time-saving solutions for assessing and diversifying collections under real and increasing constraints. Yet at the same time, the audits often flatten complex identities into standardized categories, fail to reflect local community needs, and further entrench libraries’ infrastructural dependence on commercial vendors. We conclude with recommendations for improving collection diversity audits and reflect on the broader implications for public libraries operating at the intersection of AI adoption, escalating anti-DEI backlash, and politically motivated defunding.},

This research introduces a novel Supply Chain Digital Twin (SCDT) framework for manufacturing supply chains, specifically tailored to address the manufacturing strategy selection problem at the strategic product level. To demonstrate our proposed SCDT framework, we employ the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) as a model-based systems engineering tool. The primary aim of this study is to detail the design and integration of SCDTs within manufacturing supply chain networks, facilitating decisions on manufacturing strategy selection. The practical applicability of our proposed SCDT framework is further demonstrated through a case study in the semiconductor industry, highlighting its utility and potential benefits.},

abstract = {K-12 cybersecurity education plays a critical role in cultivating the next generation of professionals in cybersecurity and software engineering. However, the limited availability of teachers with expertise in these fields, combined with the lack of high school courses covering these topics, creates a significant gap in student access to these subjects. Addressing this gap requires the broader computer science education community to provide resources that empower K-12 educators to teach these subjects effectively. This study explores innovative gamified approaches to cybersecurity education as a means to meet this need. We share the outcomes of implementing gamified activities with high school teachers, revealing promising results. On average, 79% of participating teachers expressed strong interest in using these games to teach cybersecurity concepts. Additionally, 85% reported increased interest in learning and teaching cybersecurity topics, while 92% believed these competitions could significantly boost students' interest in the subject. These findings underscore the potential of gamification to transform cybersecurity education for both educators and students.},

abstract = {Built-in SQL functions are crucial in Database Management Systems (DBMSs), supporting various operations and computations across multiple data types. They are essential for querying, data transformation, and aggregation. Despite their importance, the bugs in SQL functions have caused widespread problems in the real world, from system failures to arbitrary code execution. However, the understanding of the bug characteristics is limited. More importantly, conventional function testing methods struggle to generate semantically correct SQL test cases, while DBMS testing efforts are hard to measure built-in SQL functions.This paper presents a comprehensive study of 318 built-in SQL function bugs, shedding light on their characteristics and root causes. Our investigation reveals that 87.4% of these bugs were caused by improper handling of boundary values of arguments. The boundary values of arguments come from three sources: literal values, type castings, and nested functions. By studying the bugs from three sources, we summarized 10 SQL patterns of bug-inducing queries. Moreover, we designed Soft, a testing tool based on the patterns to test seven widely used DBMSs, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and ClickHouse. Soft discovered and confirmed 132 previously unknown SQL function bugs. The DBMS vendors took these bugs seriously and fixed 97 bugs in three days. For example, the CTO of ClickHouse commented on one bug: "We must fix it immediately or get rid of this function."},

abstract = {Modern AI systems are man-made objects that leverage machine learning to support our lives across a myriad of contexts and applications. Despite extensive epistemological and ethical debates, their metaphysical foundations remain relatively under explored. The orthodox view simply suggests that AI systems, as artifacts, lack well-posed identity and persistence conditions—their metaphysical kinds are no real kinds. In this work, we challenge this perspective by introducing a theory of metaphysical identity of AI systems. We do so by characterizing their kinds and introducing identity criteria—formal rules that answer the questions “When are two AI systems the same?” and “When does an AI system persist, despite change?” Building on Carrara and Vermaas’ account of fine-grained artifact kinds, we argue that AI trustworthiness provides a lens to understand AI system kinds and formalize the identity of these artifacts by relating their functional requirements to their physical make-ups. The identity criteria of AI systems are determined by their trustworthiness profiles—the collection of capabilities that the systems must uphold over time throughout their artifact histories, and their effectiveness in maintaining these capabilities. Our approach suggests that the identity and persistence of AI systems is sensitive to the socio-technical context of their design and utilization via their trustworthiness, providing a solid metaphysical foundation to the epistemological, ethical, and legal discussions about these artifacts.},

Four sets of practical teaching modules have been designed, corresponding to the technical skills of three-phase asynchronous motors, DC motors, stepper motors, and servo motors. By designing a semi open electrical control module, students can personally participate in the electrical assembly and debugging process of the equipment modules. The production line equipment adopts an integrated Siemens PLC as the core controller, various motors as execution components, and combines digital twin technology to design an automatic production line equipment for electromechanical training and teaching. Through this device, students can gain a deeper understanding of the application scenarios and motion control methods of four types of motors, effectively improving the practical teaching effectiveness of the teaching equipment.},

Equipped with this, carry out a fresh discussion of what constitutes a supervised data-stream learning task; including continual and reinforcement learning; highlighting major assumptions and constraints. We carry out a fresh reconsideration of approaches and methods, with regard to their suitability to modern settings. But more than a categorization of state-of-the-art streaming methods, we provide a re-introduction to what is supervised stream learning, and our emphasis here is a survey of settings, and algorithmic settings. Our main goal is to pull theory and practice of supervised learning over data streams closer together. We conclude that practical stream learning does not mandate an online-learning regime. In the modern context, learning regimes should be selected and developed according to the factual data arrival mode, resource constraints, and maximum robustness and trustworthiness. We finish with a set of recommendations to this effect.},

abstract = {The emergence of the Spatial Web -- the Web where content is tied to real-world locations has the potential to improve and enable many applications such as augmented reality, navigation, robotics, and more. The Spatial Web is missing a key ingredient that is impeding its growth -- a spatial naming system to resolve real-world locations to names. Today's spatial naming systems are digital maps such as Google and Apple maps. These maps and the location-based services provided on top of these maps are primarily controlled by a few large corporations and mostly cover outdoor public spaces. Emerging classes of applications, such as persistent world-scale augmented reality, require detailed maps of both outdoor and indoor spaces. Existing centralized mapping infrastructures are proving insufficient for such applications because of the scale of cartography efforts required and the privacy of indoor map data.In this paper, we present a case for a federated spatial naming system, or in other words, a federated mapping infrastructure. This enables disparate parties to manage and serve their own maps of physical regions and unlocks scalability of map management, isolation and privacy of maps. Map-related services such as address-to-location mapping, location-based search, and routing needs re-architecting to work on federated maps. We discuss some essential services and practicalities of enabling these services.},

Possible impacts of introducing AS at street- and city-level were investigated regarding the permitted low operating speeds of AS. Two simulation studies in Salzburg, Austria, and in Link\"{o}ping, Sweden, were conducted. Together with the real pilot plans, different scenarios, considering operational speed, frequency and service type, were addressed. No significant impacts on the respective traffic systems were revealed, even though AS operated at a low speed (15--20 km/h). It is mainly due to the relatively low traffic density and other characteristics of the selected routes. Higher travel speed and Demand-Responsive-Transport operation help to improve the efficiency of AS and to increase the public acceptance. Though, additional push measures are needed to change the domination of cars in a rural setting for influencing modal shift.},

For the first time since 1978, our symposium is being held in the "Steel City" of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, at the intersection of the Allegheny, Ohio, and Monongahela rivers. We are looking forward to four days of productive and informative presentations, vibrant and engaging discussions, and an overall wonderful experience with our SIGCSE community members. We are confident that our program of events provides meaningful and productive experiences for all.Our theme for this year is "Leading the Transformation". Our theme reflects the role of the computer science education community in adapting educational practice to new technologies and challenges. With advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) transforming both academia and the workplace, the computer science education community has a unique opportunity to help shape the future use and application of computing. Our program this year is quite diverse and offers something for everyone, so please take time to peruse the schedule and choose the sessions which appeal to you. Pittsburgh is also an exciting city with lots to see and do, so you are encouraged to enjoy all the city has to offer.The format of the 2025 Technical Symposium is similar to 2024 in many ways. We will once again have a program that extends into Saturday afternoon, including papers and the Nifty Assignment session after lunch. We will also again have three Birds-of-a-Feather sessions, two on Thursday evening and one during lunch on Friday. For online attendees, we will continue to offer streaming of keynotes, the Nifty Assignment session, the First-Timers Lunch presentation, and a small set of paper, panel, and special sessions.This year we received almost 1200 submissions. Submission statistics for all of the Technical Symposium's tracks can be found in the table that follows. Papers were submitted to one of three tracks (Computing Education Research, Experience Reports and Tools, Position and Curricula Initiatives) with reviewing tailored to each track. Each paper submission was reviewed by at least three reviewers, with a substantial proportion of papers receiving four (or more) reviews, plus a meta review. We sincerely appreciate the work of the more than 800 reviewers and 112 Associate Program Chairs who contributed to the creation of this years' program. Their reviews helped us decide which submissions were accepted while also providing detailed feedback that allowed authors to further improve the final versions of their submissions.},

abstract = {This paper introduces Curriculum Interleaved Online Behavior Cloning (IOBC) as an approach to train agents for military operations, addressing not only the challenges posed by complex and dynamic combat scenarios but also how military doctrines and strategies are transferred to these agents. It highlights the limitations of traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods and proposes interleaved online behavior cloning in combination with curriculum learning as a solution to enhance RL agent training. By leveraging rule-based agents for guidance during training, IOBC accelerates learning and improves the RL agent's performance, particularly in early stages of training and complex scenarios. The study conducted experiments using ReLeGSim, a reinforcement learning-focused simulation environment, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing agent performance and scalability. Results indicate that IOBC significantly outperforms RL agents without guidance, providing a stable foundation for learning in challenging environments. These findings underscore the potential of IOBC in real-world military applications.},

abstract = {We explore a hybrid approach to designing a biomanufacturing system with low-volume, high variability, and individualized products. Simulating a large number of possible configurations to determine those that meet target production goals is computationally impractical. We create an explainable surrogate model, specifically a queueing network model, that is calibrated to the output of a few computationally expensive simulations. The queueing network model enables a quick exploration of large numbers of mixed integer-continuous configurations, which would be challenging for traditional surrogate-based approaches. The queueing network model is used to quickly identify promising regions where a few configurations can then be evaluated with the simulation. The difference in evaluations at these configurations is used to decide whether the queueing model requires partitioning and/or re-calibration. The use of this hybrid approach with an explainable surrogate enables analysis, such as identifying bottle-necks, and gives insight into robust designs of the biomanufacturing system.},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) are a rapidly emerging field with great potential to optimize workflows across various industries. However, the unpredictable and hallucinating nature of LLMs prevents the industries from deploying MAS to production. Currently, no software exists to evaluate and test the overall performance of MAS. To address this problem, we created a quality assurance methodology that integrates system performance monitoring (cost, LLM calls, duration) with LLM evaluation software that assesses the quality of the output using various parameters such as relevance, groundedness, correctness, etc, both at the individual agent level and complete MAS. We illustrate our methodology’s efficacy in testing application and system performance for quality assurance by applying it to an LLM-based MAS under various scenarios. We believe this approach can create a framework to help industries optimize MAS for production deployment ensuring effectiveness, resource efficiency, and scalability, thereby facilitating wider adoption of LLM-based MAS technology.},

abstract = {Risk simulation is crucial for effective project management, yet conventional methods often fail to capture the complex interdependencies and interactions among risk events. This paper proposes a novel approach to project risk simulation by integrating event knowledge graphs, fuzzy logic techniques, and game theory principles. Event knowledge graphs provide a structured representation of project events and their relationships thereby facilitating the simulation of risk events and pathways; fuzzy logic enables the assessment of uncertain events; and game theory aids in identifying high-risk events and elucidating risk pathways. A methodology is outlined encompassing the construction of event repositories, establishment of event knowledge graphs, and simulation of project risks. Following, a case study of wind farm projects demonstrates the practical application of the proposed approach, highlighting its effectiveness in simulating and analyzing project risks.},

abstract = {As manufacturing rapidly evolves, optimizing processes is essential. Digital Twins, which act as near realtime virtual replicas of the corresponding real-world systems, can support this optimization by providing insights and supporting decision-making. Digital Twins can only be fully effective if their underlying models continuously and accurately reflect the corresponding physical systems. However, not all model components change at the same pace, and relevant data updates also vary in frequency. Thus, Digital Twins require robust validation mechanisms that can identify what parts of models need to be re-extracted, what parts need to be recalibrated, and what parts need to remain same. This is a complex task that necessitates precise partitioning of models with respect to the above noted considerations. Here, we propose a novel approach to modular validation, aimed at supporting Digital Twins. To illustrate our approach, we provide a case study in reliability analysis of manufacturing systems.},

abstract = {Characterising code quality is a challenge that was addressed by a previous ITiCSE Working Group (B\"{o}rstler et al., 2017). As emerged from that study, educators, developers, and students have different perceptions of the aspects involved. The perception of code quality by CS1 students develops from the feedback they receive when submitting practical work. As a consequence of increasingly large classes and the widespread use of autograders, student code is predominantly assessed based on functional correctness, emphasising a machine-oriented perspective with scarce or no feedback given about human-oriented aspects of code quality. Such limited perception of code quality may negatively impact how students understand, create, and interact with code artefacts. Although B\"{o}rstler et al. concluded that "code quality should be discussed more thoroughly in educational programs", the lack of materials and time constraints have slowed down progress in that regard.The goal of this Working Group is to support CS1 instructors who want to introduce a broader perspective on code quality in their classroom, by providing a curated list of examples and activities suitable for novices. In order to achieve this goal, we have extracted from the CS education literature a range of examples and activities, which have then been analysed and organised in terms of code quality dimensions. We have also mapped the topics covered in those materials to existing taxonomies relevant to code quality in CS1. Based on this work, we provide: (1) a catalogue of examples that illustrates the range of quality defects that could be addressed at CS1 level; and (2) a sample set of activities devised to introduce code quality to CS1 students. These materials have the potential to help educators address the subject in more depth.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Changing market conditions in the chemical industry are leading to an increased demand for fast and individually engineered chemicals. This results in a decline in mass production towards producing small, demand-driven quantities. A combination of changing demand and the need for short-term adjustments requires flexible production planning and logistics. To ensure logistics flexibility, primarily manual processes are used. However, this comes with the risk of direct contact between humans and chemicals. One way to avoid this contact and enable sufficient flexibility is to use tank containers directly connected to the production plants. This paper aims to develop a framework that combines simulation and optimization for planning the use of tank containers. Based on this framework, tank container storage materials will be selected using optimization. Furthermore, simulation helps to evaluate the influences of the selection on the logistics system. Here, the focus is on the management of general cargo containers.},

Hence, the development of a cyber-physical production system framework to merge the physical and virtual factory is motivated. This manuscript describes the integration of a supervisory control and data acquisition system with a factory digital twin, which allows production floor remote data gathering, scheduling optimization, and production floor machines remote control. A scenario of a painting shop is presented to illustrate the performance of the cyber-physical production systems framework.

As traffic densities continue to grow, incorporating a robust preemption system is vital in ensuring prompt emergency responses. Preemption systems are often evaluated under naive scenarios in a simulation environment, without consideration of the interactions between ERVs and non-ERVs. This research intends to develop ERV and non-ERV driver models to enable realistic simulation of such interactions.

In contrast to traditional approaches limited to simulating specific physical processes, simulations within a digital twin comprise polymorphic environments that accurately depict large-scale systems. These digital twins remain connected to their physical counterparts through real-time data and feedback loops. While the benefits of implementing digital twins are numerous, the resources, effort, and investment required can vary for each use case. Manufacturers often must assess the return on investment (ROI) before committing to these initiatives. However, digital twins' intricate, multidimensional nature poses challenges in accurately evaluating their ROIs. This research assesses the economic impact of developing digital twins for manufacturing systems and presents a practical framework for assessing ROI. This systematic approach can help stakeholders enhance the financial viability of digital twin projects.},

abstract = {Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) models play a vital role in code completion tasks, leveraging both prefix and suffix context to provide more accurate and contextually relevant suggestions. This paper presents approaches to improve FIM code completion while addressing the challenge of maintaining low latency for real-time coding assistance. We enhance FIM code completion by incorporating context and curriculum examples in the training process. We identify patterns where completion suggestions fail more frequently, revealing complexities that smaller language models struggle with. To address these challenges, we develop a curriculum dataset by extracting hard-to-complete patterns from code repositories and generate context examples using semantic and static analysis tools (e.g. TSC compiler). We fine-tune various sized models, including StarCoder and DeepSeek, on this enhanced dataset. Our evaluation encompasses three key dimensions: the Santa Coder FIM task, the Amazon CCEval benchmark, and a new Multi-Line Infilling evaluation benchmark derived from SWE-bench. Comprehensive ablation studies across multiple model sizes reveal that while all fine-tuned models show improvements, the performance gains are more pronounced for smaller parameter models and that incorporating difficult-to-complete examples as part of curriculum learning improves completion performance. This finding is particularly sig- nificant given the latency constraints of code completion tasks. While larger models like GPT and Claude perform well in multi- line completions but are prohibitively challenging to use given high latency, and our fine-tuned models achieve a balance between per- formance and latency. Finally, we validate our approach through online A/B testing, demonstrating tangible improvements in Completion Acceptance Rate (CAR) and Completion Persistence Rate (CPR), with zero latency impact.},

abstract = {With the acceleration of digital transformation, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a key technology to promote social progress. This paper proposes a set of teaching reform strategies based on the concept of Outcome-Based Education (OBE) for talent cultivation in the field of Artificial Intelligence. This study was implemented in the School of Electronics and Computer Science, Southeast University Chengxian College, aiming to cultivate AI application talents with solid theoretical foundation, proficient technical application ability and good professional quality through teaching reform. The reform strategies include the construction and optimization of the curriculum system, the reorganization and innovation of teaching content, the diversified application of teaching methods, the in-depth practice of project-driven teaching, and the exploration of online and offline hybrid teaching models. Special emphasis is placed on case and project driven teaching methods to realize the OBE concept and promote the development of students' practical skills and innovative thinking. Moreover, this paper also explores the reform of the teaching evaluation system and establishes a multi-dimensional and process-based evaluation system to comprehensively examine students' learning outcomes. The reform results show that students have significantly improved in course learning, academic competitions, college students’ innovation and entrepreneurship training program, and the quality of graduation design, and students' comprehensive literacy has been comprehensively developed. The teaching reform practice of this study provides new ideas and methods for application-oriented talent cultivation in the field of artificial intelligence. It is expected to provide more high-quality application-oriented talents for the industry and provide a reference for education reform.},

If it is necessary to detect the gas humidity, the gas to be measured will enter the catheter through the air inlet at one end of the system, the hygroscopic material layer absorbs the moisture in the gas to be measured, which causes the volume of the hygroscopic material layer to change, and then changes the pressure in the catheter, the flexible material layer in the system deforms and acts on the piezoelectric material layer in the system. Under the action of pressure, the piezoelectric material layer produces opposite polarity charges at both ends, the first electrode and the second electrode detect the potential difference of the piezoelectric material under pressure, and according to the relationship between the potential difference and the humidity of the gas to be measured, the humidity of the gas to be measured is obtained. The detection system of gas humidity presented in this paper has simple structure and strong expandability, which provides a new method for gas humidity detection.},

Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as tools that are capable of processing and extracting insights from massive unstructured textual datasets. However, how to leverage LLMs for text analytics Information Systems (IS) research is currently unclear. To assist the IS community in understanding how to operationalize LLMs, we propose a Text Analytics for Information Systems Research (TAISR) framework. Our proposed framework provides detailed recommendations grounded in IS and LLM literature on how to conduct meaningful text analytics IS research for design science, behavioral, and econometric streams. We conducted three business intelligence case studies using our TAISR framework to demonstrate its application in several IS research contexts. We also outline the potential challenges and limitations of adopting LLMs for IS. By offering a systematic approach and evidence of its utility, our TAISR framework contributes to future IS research streams looking to incorporate powerful LLMs for text analytics.},

The paper aims to demonstrate the potential functions and roles of this corpus, providing solid data support for automated proofs, formal verification, and other related fields. This corpus facilitates the automated processing and understanding of mathematical theorems.

abstract = {We are delighted to introduce the first volume of the ASPLOS proceedings for 2025. The conference is in its third year of an experiment with a three-deadline structure: authors can submit to any of three separate review cycles handled by a single year-long program committee. This volume includes papers from the first two review cycles, which had submission deadlines in the spring and summer of 2024. We combined the two cycles because submission volumes in the spring cycle were disproportionately small.This volume contains 72 of the 74 papers accepted to ASPLOS 2025 to date. This includes papers accepted in the spring and summer cycles and those invited to submit a revision in the spring cycle that was ultimately accepted. Two of these 74 accepted papers are still undergoing artifact evaluation and will be published in a subsequent volume. The spring and summer review cycles saw a combined 586 submissions. These submissions were reviewed by a 208-person Program Committee augmented by 57 External Review Committee members. On occasion, we solicited a small number of external expert reviews. On the PC, 129 members self-reported they were in an academic role and 77 self-reported they were in an industrial role. On the ERC it was 43 and 13 respectively. The median PhD year of the combined committees was 2014. In addition to these committees, we engaged ten vice chairs, experienced and trusted reviewers who helped us monitor the review process for each paper.These committees reviewed all of the submissions that were not desk rejected (11 papers) or withdrawn (4 papers). In keeping with recent norms, the technical review happened in two phases. Each paper received three reviews in the first round, with, in most cases, two additional reviews in the second round for the 54% of submissions that advanced. To assign reviews, we used the Toronto Paper Matching System (TPMS) to provide a preliminary review assignment that matched reviewer expertise. We then manually inspected and adjusted these assignments as needed: for example, to correct errors in TPMS's topic modeling or adjust to late-discovered conflicts. In addition, each paper was assigned a non-conflicted chair and a non-conflicted vice chair to provide two extra sets of eyes to monitor and facilitate the process. Due to the size and distribution of the PC, which spanned 14 time zones, the PC did not meet synchronously. Instead, each paper was discussed by the reviewers via comments in the HotCRP system. Ultimately, the discussion for each paper reached one of three outcomes: rejection, conditional acceptance, or major revision. All conditionally accepted papers were shepherded. Major revision papers were invited to revise and resubmit their paper for a second round of review by a subset of the original reviewers. All authors of papers that advanced to the second round of review were given the opportunity to see and respond to their reviewer questions prior to the reviewer discussion.},

abstract = {Digital models, digital shadows, and digital twins (DTs) are increasingly used in manufacturing/Industry 4.0 to represent levels of integration between physical systems and their digital counterparts; data-flow mechanisms are the enablers of such integration. Healthcare operations management has also witnessed rising interest in hybrid models that use real-time data to increase situational awareness (SA) and enable short-term decision-making. In M&amp;S literature, such models are referred to as Real-time Simulations (RtS) and DTs. Healthcare organizations can realize a heightened state of SA by transitioning from conventional modeling to RtS/DTs. The paper presents a Maturity Model for DTs to contextualize the increasing levels of healthcare Information Systems/Information Technology (IS/IT) integration with real-time models that such a shift will necessitate. The higher the Maturity Level of IS/IT integration, the greater the opportunity to develop modeling artifacts that realize the potential of real-time data and enable organizations to attain higher levels of SA.},

We introduce novel Gen AI based enhancements to Striim, a distributed streaming platform that enables unified real-time data integration and intelligence. Striim provides high-throughput, low-latency event processing with a scale- out architecture. It can ingest streaming data from multiple sources, process data with a SQL-like continuous query language, analyze data with sophisticated machine learning and large language models, write data into a variety of targets, and visualize data to support real-time decision making. It guarantees Exactly-Once-Processing semantics and fault tolerance. In this demonstration, we showcase Striim's ability to identify sensitive data over fast-moving data streams in real time using LLMs.},

We consider the problem of hierarchically decomposing the network and introduce an edge-based decomposition framework that unifies the core and truss decompositions for temporal networks while allowing us to consider the network's temporal dimension. Based on our new framework, we introduce the (k,∆)-core and (k,∆)-truss decompositions, which are generalizations of the classic k-core and k-truss decompositions for multigraphs. Moreover, we show how (k,∆)-cores and (k,∆)-trusses can be efficiently further decomposed to obtain spatially and temporally connected components. We evaluate the characteristics of our new decompositions and the efficiency of our algorithms. Moreover, we demonstrate how our (k,∆)-decompositions can be applied to analyze malicious content in a Twitter network to obtain insights that state-of-the-art baselines cannot obtain.},

abstract = {Genome sequencing is continuing to revolutionize the medical, forensics, agricultural, and biosecurity fields. The enormous amounts of data from modern sequencing technology, require significant time and cost to obtain accurate results using general-purpose computing resources. The emergence of third-generation sequencers called nanopore sequencers offers small, cheap, and portable genome sequencing capabilities. However, the bottleneck during computational analysis limits scalability and portability. This paper introduces the necessity for one, optimization of existing algorithms; two, efficient utilization of existing heterogeneous systems; and three, novel algorithms and domain-specific architectures for rapid in situ analysis of third-generation sequencing data. State-of-the-art examples are described and future challenges are outlined.},

Concerns about whose voices are cited, heard, and privileged have encouraged interventions for Technical and Professional Communication (TPC) scholars to promote inclusivity and equity in scholarly writing and the design of communication. This article examines another aspect on citation injustices tied to publishing policies and style-guide conventions and conformity: practices for crediting shared first authors and equally contributing authors for their scholarship. We question current citation practices and examine style-guide rules and conventions of 115 TPC and communication-related journals to identify where citation injustices may occur in scenarios with shared first authors and equally contributing authors. We argue that TPC scholars should pushback against style-guide conformity in their publications and citations to embrace more equitable and socially just practices. We conclude by presenting five opportunities for TPC and communication scholars to change current citation practices in our field.},

In contrast to dependency-based reuse, the infrastructure to systematically support copy-based reuse appears to be entirely missing. Our aim is to enable future research and tool development to increase efficiency and reduce the risks of copy-based reuse. We seek a better understanding of such reuse by measuring its prevalence and identifying factors affecting the propensity to reuse. To identify reused artifacts and trace their origins, our method exploits World of Code infrastructure. We begin with a set of theory-derived factors related to the propensity to reuse, sample instances of different reuse types, and survey developers to better understand their intentions. Our results indicate that copy-based reuse is common, with many developers being aware of it when writing code. The propensity for a file to be reused varies greatly among languages and between source code and binary files, consistently decreasing over time. Files introduced by popular projects are more likely to be reused, but at least half of reused resources originate from “small” and “medium” projects. Developers had various reasons for reuse but were generally positive about using a package manager.},

In this research, we aim to identify proper strategies for the number of containers or payloads the robot should carry per shift under different scenarios using Agent-Based Modeling and Discrete Event Simulation. Our primary objective is to minimize the number of shifts a mobile robot should travel for replenishment while keeping idle time low across all stations and ensuring timely material replenishment. The results show that choosing which strategy to use for the implementation of the autonomous navigating robot depends on the maximum number of containers it can carry and the utilization of payload space. While this paper focuses on Tiger Motors Assembly line at Auburn University, its applications could be extended to similar assembly plants equipped with a similar material replenishment system.},

abstract = {This paper is about semantic regular expressions (SemREs). This is a concept that was recently proposed by Smore (Chen et al. 2023) in which classical regular expressions are extended with a primitive to query external oracles such as databases and large language models (LLMs). SemREs can be used to identify lines of text containing references to semantic concepts such as cities, celebrities, political entities, etc. The focus in their paper was on automatically synthesizing semantic regular expressions from positive and negative examples. In this paper, we study the membership testing problem. First, we present a two-pass NFA-based algorithm to determine whether a string w matches a SemRE r in O(|r|2 |w|2 + |r| |w|3) time, assuming the oracle responds to each query in unit time. In common situations, where oracle queries are not nested, we show that this procedure runs in O(|r|2 |w|2) time. Experiments with a prototype implementation of this algorithm validate our theoretical analysis, and show that the procedure massively outperforms a dynamic programming-based baseline, and incurs a ≈ 2 \texttimes{} overhead over the time needed for interaction with the oracle. Second, we establish connections between SemRE membership testing and the triangle finding problem from graph theory, which suggest that developing algorithms which are simultaneously practical and asymptotically faster might be challenging. Furthermore, algorithms for classical regular expressions primarily aim to optimize their time and memory consumption. In contrast, an important consideration in our setting is to minimize the cost of invoking the oracle. We demonstrate an Ω(|w|2) lower bound on the number of oracle queries necessary to make this determination.},

abstract = {The design and performance optimization of flash-based storage subsystems are crucial for improving the system performance of Android-based smartphones. However, it highly relies on wisdom derived from mobile storage workload studies of smartphone applications. From the temporal perspective, our burstiness diagnosis reveals that the arrival processes of I/O requests in 33 smartphone applications, are significantly bursty, especially for read requests. This paper studies the correlation of inter-arrival times of read and write requests, and compares the correlations for read and write requests in the four same types of mobile applications. We first observe that read requests of 85% of applications and write requests of 88% of applications present a certain degree of correlation over a longer time range. Then, we further conduct Hurst parameter estimation for these mobile applications with mature statistical tools. All estimated Hurst parameters are larger than 0.5, confirming the existence of self-similarity in a majority of mobile application workloads. Finally, we deploy a flexible I/O request generator for smartphone applications based on the parameters measured from actual traces. Experimental results show that the proposed generator can accurately generate request sequences for various mobile applications and more faithfully characterize the heavy-tail properties of I/O activities in mobile storage workloads than traditional models.},

abstract = {This paper describes the core concepts and challenges in developing Trinity - a high-assurance neuro-symbolic approach to trustworthy and resilient machine learning for applications in open-world, contested, and rapidly-evolving environments. The two central concepts in Trinity are a neuro-symbolic factored world model that identifies entities, activities, and complex events, and the notion of surprise against this world model that is used for self-adaptation and learning, as well as runtime assurance. The world model is not derived purely as a bottom-up inference from sensors treating each observation as independent uncorrelated input; instead, we iteratively interleave bottom-up inference (conditioned on context) with top-down predictions and context identification using a three-layered hierarchical predictive processing (HPP) stack. Thus, the neuro-symbolic inference in Trinity is bidirectional - learning-based bottom-up pull that is uncertainty-driven and reasoning-based symbolic top-down push that is decision-driven. The progressively symbolic higher layers capture a larger context than the bottom layers finally culminating in the highest layer implemented using large language models. Any surprise arising from the mismatch between the top-down prediction and the bottom-up inference is used for the continual adaptation of Trinity. The inference in Trinity produces a factored temporal world model as the result of perception. The predictions are accompanied by a quantitative measure of surprise from the 3-layered HPP stack. This surprise corresponds to the confidence of the model in its current inference. The continuous monitoring and adaptation accompanied by risk analysis make Trinity robust to semantic adversarial perturbations and more efficiently generalizable to novelties. The hierarchical nature of Trinity also enables adaptation of the architecture to the available compute resources.},

In order to ensure resilience to these disruptions, supply chains can use mitigation strategies to minimize risk and maximize recovery. Modeling approaches can be utilized to determine the most appropriate mitigation strategies for a specific scenario; however, there is currently no recognized modeling framework which can be applied to all supply chain sectors. This paper describes the key disruption risks to supply chains; the resilience and optimization strategies and performance metrics employed by supply chains to mitigate these risks; and the applications of simulation modeling in supply chain management. We present a hybrid framework for using agent-based modeling, alongside early warning systems, many objective optimization and option awareness analysis, to manage exogenous risks for a non-specific supply chain.},

abstract = {Efficient solver for general linear equations is of significance for EDA problems. The generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method, which can solve general linear equations efficiently, is one of the most widely-used fundamental algorithms. Randomized Arnoldi process, which leverages sketched least-squares solver to orthogonalize Krylov subspace basis, has shown potential to promote the effectiveness of Arnoldi process, the core step in GMRES. However, how to make it more efficient, and utilize it to develop a practical GMRES solver is still an open problem. In this work, we aim at obtaining a practically-useful randomized GMRES algorithm (named PRGMRES) for solving general sparse linear equations. Firstly, an efficient estimator of residual error based on a modified randomized Gram-Schmidt process and a double-tolerance scheme are proposed to enable a practical restarted GMRES algorithm which terminates at a solution satisfying the specified accuracy tolerance. Then, a linear-time-complexity sketching algorithm based on Rademacher matrices is proposed to facilitate fast and robust random sketching. After that, incremental solution of the sketched least-squares problems, and the theoretical analysis supporting smaller sketching size are presented. Based on the above proposed techniques and theoretical results, the PRGMRES algorithm, which has stronger theoretically-supported stability and efficiency, is proposed. Numerical experiments on various circuit simulation problems validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {Large-scale models are typically adapted to meet the diverse requirements of model owners and users. However, maintaining multiple specialized versions of the model is inefficient. In response, we propose AIM, a novel model modulation paradigm that enables a single model to exhibit diverse behaviors to meet the specific end requirements. AIM enables two key modulation modes: utility and focus modulations. The former provides model owners with dynamic control over output quality to deliver varying utility levels, and the latter offers users precise control to shift model's focused input features. AIM introduces a logits redistribution strategy that operates in a training data-agnostic and retraining-free manner. We establish a formal foundation to ensure AIM's regulation capability, based on the statistical properties of logits ordering via joint probability distributions. Our evaluation confirms AIM's practicality and versatility for AI model modulation, with tasks spanning image classification, semantic segmentation and text generation, and prevalent architectures including ResNet, SegFormer and Llama.},

abstract = {Empirical studies have shown that real-life queueing systems, such as contact centers, exhibit non-Markovian and nonstationary behaviors. Consequently, analyzing their performance poses significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a simulation-based autoregressive deep learning algorithm (SADLA) for predicting service levels in non-Markovian, nonstationary queueing systems. Our method leverages modern recurrent neural networks, which are trained on synthetic data to capture the intrinsic spatio-temporal characteristics of queueing systems. Our findings demonstrate that SADLA achieves high prediction accuracy while reducing computational complexity by six orders of magnitude compared to traditional simulation methods. The implications of our research extend beyond accurate queue performance analysis; by embracing the learning capabilities of neural networks, our approach contributes to the advancement of the overall performance and resilience of real-life service systems.},

abstract = {Solving black-box global optimization problems efficiently across domains remains challenging especially for large scale optimization problems. Bayesian optimization has obtained important success as a black box optimization technique based on surrogates, but it still suffers when applied to large scale heterogeneous landscapes. Recent approaches have proposed non-myopic approximations and partitioning of the input domain into subregions to prioritize regions that capture important areas of the solution space. We propose a Multi Agent Rollout formulation of Bayesian optimization (MAroBO) that partitions the input domain among finite set of agents for distributed sampling. In addition to selecting candidate samples from their respective sub regions, these agents also influence each other in partitioning the sub regions. Consequently, a portion of the function is optimized by these agents which prioritize candidate samples that don't undermine exploration in favor of a single step greedy exploitation. The efficacy of MAroBO is demonstrated on synthetic test functions.},

abstract = {The Royal Canadian Navy is currently undertaking a fleet mix study to determine the optimal composition of its fleet to meet future operational requirements. The operational demand is modeled by generating possible future timelines of vignettes that can occur concurrently using a Monte Carlo discrete event simulation model. In this paper, we examine two aspects related to modeling operational demand stochastically: the number of replications required to ensure that the input frequencies of the vignettes correspond to a certain level of accuracy in the output frequencies from the simulation; and how the application of concurrency constraints to individual vignettes may lower the output frequencies if events are scheduled purely at random. We propose a modified scheduling algorithm that better maintains the input frequencies. Both aspects need to be taken into consideration to ensure that the modeled operational demands are representative of possible and probable futures for the Navy.},

isbn = {9798331534202},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Infrastructure systems are interdependent at various levels, and their collective performance is influenced by factors such as topology, budgetary decisions, resource availability, and awareness of interdependency. Traditional resource allocation models for improving resilience often assume a single decision-maker overseeing all scheduling decisions. However, critical infrastructures, characterized by a network-of-networks structure, are managed by individual entities with distinct boundaries. Moreover, the dynamic and stochastic nature of decision-making processes cannot always be captured via mathematical programming. This study develops a hybrid simulation model that merges top-down and bottom-up approaches. It captures organizational-level budgetary decision-making dynamics through system dynamics, and maintenance activities alongside evolving network performance through an agent-based model. Optimal restoration strategies maximizing network resilience are identified via deep reinforcement learning, constrained by financial allocations. This approach is applied to water distribution and mobility networks in Tampa, FL demonstrating our method's efficacy for restoring interdependent infrastructures.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the complementary relationship between Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods like machine learning. While M&amp;S uses algorithms to model system behavior from input parameters, AI learns patterns from correlation in data. The paper argues that hybrid models combining M&amp;S and AI can be more powerful than either alone. It provides a conceptual framework showing how M&amp;S and AI can be integrated in sequential, parallel, complementary or competitive configurations. Several example applications are given where AI enhances M&amp;S and vice versa, such as using AI to optimize simulation parameters, generate synthetic training data for AI from simulations, interpret AI model behavior through simulation, and automate aspects of simulation development with AI assistance. The potential benefits of hybrid AI/M&amp;S modeling span improved accuracy, efficiency, trustworthiness and cross-disciplinary collaboration. The paper calls for further research developing a solid theoretical foundation for merging these complementary paradigms.},

One critical component is the ability to accurately translate natural language queries into corresponding SQL queries, a field known as Text-to-SQL. However, the scarcity of high-quality, large-scale, and domain-specific Text-to-SQL datasets hinders the development of reliable and robust models. To tackle these challenges, we propose SelectCraft, a novel automatic generation approach designed to create realistic Text-to-SQL datasets tailored to specific domains. Our method leverages existing databases and their structures to generate complex text-SQL pairs that mirror real-world usage scenarios. As a proof of concept, we have successfully generated a substantial financial Text-to-SQL dataset, denominated as BanQies, encompassing over 1 million samples utilizing our proposed approach. Moreover, we introduce BanQL, a new large language model (LLM) based on StarCoder2, a state-of-the-art code-based LLM, and fine-tuned on our newly created dataset. We evaluate BanQL performance against several state-of-the-art models, demonstrating significant enhancements in accuracy and generalizability, highlighting the advantages of incorporating domain-specific data in Text-to-SQL tasks. We firmly believe that our contributions have the potential to improve the overall reliability of Text-to-SQL software systems.},

Electroencephalography (EEG) microstate analysis emerges as a promising neurophysiological method to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain networks at high temporal resolution. An EEG microstate represents a unique topography of electric potentials over the multichannel EEG records. However, academia has neglected classifying published studies on EEG microstate analysis related to SE. Hence, a careful understanding of state-of-the-art studies remains limited and inconclusive. This article aims to classify studies on the EEG microstate analysis in cognitive SE tasks. We conducted a systematic mapping study following well-established guidelines to answer ten research questions. After careful filtering, 54 primary studies (out of 1.545) were selected from 8 electronic databases. The main results are that most primary studies focus on revealing brain dynamics, exploring a wide range of EEG microstate application contexts and experimental tasks, running empirical studies in a controlled environment, using K-means as a clustering method, applying ICA-based strategy to filter artifacts, such as muscle activity and eye blinks. However, No study has applied EEG microstate analysis to SE, highlighting a significant gap and the need for further research. Finally, this article presents a classification taxonomy and identifies critical challenges and future research directions.},

Due to the non-tamperable nature of the underlying blockchain, smart contracts are difficult to update once deployed, which requires redeploying the contracts and migrating the data. It means that the observation of smart contract evolution in the real world makes more sense. Hence, in this paper, we conducted the first large-scale empirical study to characterize the evolution of smart contracts in Ethereum. For evolution identification, we presented a contract similarity-based search algorithm, digEvolution, and evaluated its effectiveness with five different search strategies. Then we applied this algorithm to 80,152 on-chain contracts we collected from Ethereum, to dig out the evolution among these contracts. We then explored three research questions. We first studied whether the evolution of smart contracts is common (RQ1), then we studied how do the Gas consumption (RQ2) and the vulnerability (RQ3) of smart contracts vary during the evolution. Our research results show that the evolution of smart contracts is not very common. There are some contract components that have vulnerability but still be called by users. The Gas consumption of most smart contracts doesn’t vary during the evolution, contract is Gas-efficient before and after the evolution. The vulnerability of most smart contracts doesn’t vary during the evolution, both are secure before and after the evolution.},

Our workload-adaptive scheduler aims to maintain the bandwidth utilization at a level that reflects the resource requirement of the job queue. We further enhance the efficacy of our approach by introducing a "two-group" approximation technique that ensures efficient performance regardless of the availability of zero-throughput jobs.

Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated considerable potential in addressing this challenge across various tasks that require such multimodal integration. However, their application in multimodal sequential recommendation (MSR) has not been extensively studied. To bridge this gap, we introduce MSRBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate different LVLM integration strategies in web-based recommendation scenarios. We benchmark three state-of-the-art LVLMs, i.e., GPT-4 Vision, GPT-4o, and Claude-3-Opus, on the next item prediction task using the constructed Amazon Review Plus dataset, which includes additional item descriptions generated by LVLMs. Our evaluation examines five integration strategies: using LVLMs as recommender, item enhancer, reranker, and various combinations of these roles. The benchmark results reveal that 1) using LVLMs as rerankers is the most effective strategy, significantly outperforming others that rely on LVLMs to directly generate recommendations or only enhance items; 2) GPT-4o consistently achieves the best performance across most scenarios, particularly when employed as a reranker; 3) the computational inefficiency of LVLMs presents a major barrier to their widespread adoption in real-time multimodal recommendation systems.

abstract = {While large Transformer models have exhibited outstanding performance on multimodal tasks, the underlying massive parameters land up with memory-wall issues. To address this bottleneck, SRAM-based compute-in-memory (CiM) is a promising technique. However, frequent off-chip weight loading due to limited on-chip capacity could severely limit the systemlevel energy efficiency. Recently, a high-density CiM structure at 16.4Mb/mm2, YOLoC, has shown the potential of complete on-chip deployment of a large detection model using transistor-based read-only-memory (ROM). However, it is still challenging to deploy even larger Transformer models. With opportunities provided by LoRA for finetuning large pretrained models on ROM-CiM with very light SRAM-CiMs, this work achieves ultra-high density up to 165.6Mb/mm2 by eliminating the use of transistors for ROM-CiM with a proposed 3D-METRO and a 3D stacking array on the mature CMOS process. Unlike the usual belief that parasitics have negative impacts, this work observes that parasitics can be utilized for data storage. Furthermore, a local recovering unit (LRU) is proposed for addressing the interference due to the transistor-less structure. 3D-METRO achieves ultra-high density improvement over the previous YOLoC, which is hundreds of times higher than that of SRAM-CiM, enabling the opportunity for large language model (LLM) deployment on a single chip with 28x energy efficiency improvement.},

abstract = {Objectives. This study addresses the challenges faced by students repeating an introductory programming course (CS1) at an online university, where dropout and failure rates remain high. While programming education has been widely studied, targeted interventions for repeating students remain scarce. Our research aims to analyze the experiences of these students and develop a tailored intervention to improve support mechanisms.Participants. The study focuses on students retaking CS1, which were categorized into two groups: those who previously attempted but failed the course, and those who dropped out early with almost no follow-up of the course.Method. An observational approach was used to analyze students’ performance, behavior, and perceptions, combining data from institutional databases and questionnaires. Based on these insights, an intervention was designed, incorporating individualized feedback, structured engagement activities, and encouragement for students to reflect on their past experiences in order to foster a more supportive learning environment.Findings. Initial results indicate that the intervention increased student engagement, particularly in the early weeks of the semester. However, some students continued to struggle with course content, suggesting the need for additional instructional support. While the intervention was effective in fostering engagement, its impact on overall success rates was limited, highlighting the necessity of more personalized approaches.Conclusions. The study provides valuable insights for educators seeking to improve support for repeating students in programming courses. Key lessons include the importance of proactive engagement, tailored feedback, and structured interventions. Future research should focus on developing personalized interventions, validating a tailored questionnaire for deeper insights, and exploring adaptive learning technologies and longitudinal studies to enhance academic outcomes while reducing instructor workload.},

abstract = {In recent years, interest in RISC-V computing architectures has moved from academic to mainstream, especially in the field of High Performance Computing where energy limitations are increasingly a concern. As of this year, the first single board RISC-V CPUs implementing the finalized ratified vector specification are being released. The RISC-V vector specification follows in the tradition of vector processors found in the CDC STAR-100, the Cray-1, the Convex C-Series, and the NEC SX machines and accelerators. The family of vector processors offers support for variable-length array processing as opposed to the fixed-length processing functionality offered by SIMD. Vector processors offer opportunities to perform vector-chaining which allows temporary results to be used without the need to resolve memory references.In this work, we use the Octo-Tiger multi-physics, multi-scale, 3D adaptive mesh refinement astrophysics application to study these early RISC-V chips with vector machine support. We report on our experience in porting this modern C++ code (which is built upon several open-source libraries such as HPX and Kokkos) to RISC-V. In addition, we show the impact of the RISC-V Vector extension on a RISC-V single board computer by implementing the std: experimental:simd interface and integrating it with our code. We also compare the application's performance, scalability, and power consumption on desktop-grade RISC-V computer to an A64FX system.The results presented in this paper are part of a longer-term evaluation of RISC-V's viability for HPC applications.},

abstract = {Process mining enables organizations to analyze the data stored in their information systems and derive insights regarding their business processes. However, raw data needs to be converted into a format that can be fed into process mining algorithms. Various pre-analysis activities can be performed on the raw data, such as imperfection removal or granularity level change. Although pre-analysis activities play a crucial role in process mining, there is currently a limited overview available regarding their scope and the extent of their examination. This study presents a systematic literature review of the pre-analysis activities in process mining projects. To better understand this stage and its current state of research, we explore which activities constitute the pre-analysis stage, their goals, the applied research methodologies, the proposed research outcomes, and the data used to evaluate the research outcomes. We identify 15 pre-analysis activities and concepts, e.g., data extraction, generation, and cleaning. We also discover that design science research is the methodology and methods are the primary research outcome in previous studies. We also realize that the proposed outcomes have been evaluated using only real-life data most of the time. This study reveals that research on pre-analysis is a growing field of interest in process mining.},

abstract = {ABET criteria for accreditation of undergraduate computer science (CS) degrees require universities to cover within their curricula topics including ''local and global impacts of computing solutions on individuals, organizations, and society,'' and to prepare their students to ''make informed judgments in computing practice, taking into account legal, ethical, diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility principles''. A growing body of research similarly identifies the need for CS programs to integrate ethics into their degree requirements, both through standalone ethics-related courses and embedded modules or case studies on the ethical impacts in 'technical' courses. The calls for increased attention to CS ethics education have become more pressing with the emergence of sophisticated consumer-ready AI technologies, which pose new ethical challenges in the forms of bias, hallucination, and autonomous decision-making. Yet it remains unclear whether current university curricula are adequately preparing future graduates to confront these challenges. This paper presents a systematic review of the degree requirements of 250 computer science bachelor's degree programs worldwide. We categorize each program according to whether a CS-related ethics course is offered and/or required by the department, finding that almost half of all universities we review do not offer any computing ethics courses, and only 33% of universities require students to take an ethics course to obtain their degree. We analyze differences among public US, private US, and non-US universities and discuss implications for curricular changes and the state of undergraduate computing ethics education.},

abstract = {Models are simplified descriptions of real systems. To increase their usefulness, models need to be as transparent as possible so that the formulation, the data, and all the assumptions about the real system implemented in the model, are salient, evident, documented, and readily available for inspection. In this paper, transparency in models---particularly models formulated using the System Dynamics approach---is discussed and the use of an automated tool---the System Dynamics Modeling Documentation and Assessment tool---for model documentation and assessment is advanced. The proposed tool is showcased using a simple susceptible-infectious epidemics model and the Urban1 model---a simplified version of the full Urban model documented in Forrester (1969). The use of the tool and the benefits derived from using it during the model building process are presented and explained.},

abstract = {Bringing more transparency to the judicial system for the purposes of increasing accountability often demands extensive effort from auditors who must meticulously sift through numerous disorganized legal case files to detect patterns of bias and errors. For example, the high-profile investigation into the Curtis Flowers case took seven reporters a full year to assemble evidence about the prosecutor's history of selecting racially biased juries. LLMs have the potential to automate and scale these transparency pipelines, especially given their demonstrated capabilities to extract information from unstructured documents. We discuss the opportunities and challenges of using LLMs to provide transparency in two important court processes: jury selection in criminal trials and housing eviction cases.},

abstract = {Intermittently-operating embedded computing platforms powered by energy harvesting must frequently checkpoint their computation state. Using non-volatile memory reduces checkpoint size by eliminating the need to checkpoint volatile memory but increases checkpoint frequency to cover Write After Read (WAR) dependencies. Additionally, non-volatile memory is significantly slower to access - while consuming more energy than its volatile counterpart - suggesting the use of a data cache. Unfortunately, existing data cache solutions do not fit the challenges of intermittent computing and often require additional hardware or software to detect WARs. In this paper, we extend the data cache by integrating it with WAR detection - dropping the need for an additional memory tracker. This idea forms the basis of NACHO: a data cache tailored to intermittent computing. NACHO, on average, reduces intermittent computing runtime overhead by 54% compared to state of the art cache-based systems. It also reduces the number of non-volatile memory writes by 82% compared to a data cache-less system, and 18% on average compared to multiple state of the art cache-based systems.},

abstract = {Relation extraction (RE) is critical in information extraction (IE) and knowledge graph construction. RE aims to identify the semantic relations between entities from natural language texts. Traditional RE models often rely on many manually annotated training samples, which are limited when data is scarce. Therefore, exploring how to perform relation extraction under few-shot conditions has become a research focus. Recently, prompt learning has attracted attention from researchers due to its ability to fully activate the potential of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), especially making significant progress in Few-Shot Relation Extraction (FSRE). This paper comprehensively reviews FSRE based on prompt learning. We first introduce the fundamental concepts of FSRE and prompt learning. Then, we systematically review recent research advances in FSRE with prompt learning, focusing on two perspectives: template construction and model fine-tuning strategies. Next, we summarize the benchmark datasets, evaluation metrics, and experimental results of representative works in FSRE. Afterward, we present practical applications of prompt-based FSRE in specialized domains. Finally, we discuss the critical challenges and future research directions of FSRE tasks based on prompt learning.},
